abstract = {Aiming at the inaccuracy of pathological image diagnosis results of traditional models, the machine learning technology is introduced and a new pathological image diagnosis method is then proposed. In this method, the accuracy of traditional pathological image diagnosis is transformed into the accuracy of detailed information annotation of pathological image. Pathological image pooling is completed through convolutional neural network, and some pathological images with dimensional blurring phenomenon are sharpened. On the basis of the pooling and sharpening of pathological image, the features of pathological image based on convolutional neural network are extracted. And then machine learning technology is used to annotate the extracted pathological image features and complete the automatic annotation of pathological image details.

abstract = {In order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of colon cancer, a novel classification algorithm based on sub-patch weight color histogram and improved SVM is proposed, which has good approximation ability for complex pathological image. Our proposed algorithm combines wavelet kernel SVM with color histogram to classify pathological image. Firstly, the pathological image is divided into non-overlapping sub-patches, and the features of sub-patch histogram are extracted. Then, the global and local features are fused by the sub-patch weighting algorithm. Then, the RelicfF based forward selection algorithm is used to integrate color features and texture features so as to enhance the characterization capabilities of the tumor cell. Finally, Morlet wavelet kernel-based least squares support vector machine method is adopted to enhance the generalization ability of the model for small sample with non-linear and high-dimensional pattern classification problems. Experimental results show that the proposed pathological diagnostic algorithm can gain higher accuracy compared with existing comparison algorithms.},

abstract = {Breast cancer has become an important factor affecting human health. Diagnosis based on pathological images is considered the gold standard in the clinic. In this paper, an automatic breast cancer detection method based on hybrid features is proposed for pathological images. To obtain better segmentation results under conditions of crowded and chromatin-sparse nuclei, a 3-output convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to segment the nuclei. Due to the weak correlation between the hematoxylin (H) and eosin (E) channels, texture features are separately extracted for the two channels, which provides more representative results. From multiple perspectives, the morphological features, spatial structural features and texture features are extracted and fused. Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with improved generalization, the pathological image is classified as benign or malignant on the basis of the relief method for feature selection. For the University of California, Santa Barbara database (UCSB), the classification accuracy of the method is 96.7%, and the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.983. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields superior classification performance compared with existing techniques.},

abstract = {Automatic classification of colon into normal and malignant classes is complex due to numerous factors including similar colors in different biological constituents of histopathological imagery. Therefore, such techniques, which exploit the textural and geometric properties of constituents of colon tissues, are desired. In this paper, a novel feature extraction strategy that mathematically models the geometric characteristics of constituents of colon tissues is proposed. In this study, we also show that the hybrid feature space encompassing diverse knowledge about the tissues' characteristics is quite promising for classification of colon biopsy images. This paper thus presents a hybrid feature space based colon classification (HFS-CC) technique, which utilizes hybrid features for differentiating normal and malignant colon samples. The hybrid feature space is formed to provide the classifier different types of discriminative features such as features having rich information about geometric structure and image texture. Along with the proposed geometric features, a few conventional features such as morphological, texture, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) are also used to develop a hybrid feature set. The SIFT features are reduced using minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy (mRMR). Various kernels of support vector machines (SVM) are employed as classifiers, and their performance is analyzed on 174 colon biopsy images. The proposed geometric features have achieved an accuracy of 92.62%, thereby showing their effectiveness. Moreover, the proposed HFS-CC technique achieves 98.07% testing and 99.18% training accuracy. The better performance of HFS-CC is largely due to the discerning ability of the proposed geometric features and the developed hybrid feature space. A novel colon cancer detection system has been proposed.The proposed system utilizes a hybrid of traditional and novel features for classification.Novel geometric features, which mathematically quantify the variation in the structure of normal and malignant colon tissues, have been proposed.The proposed geometric features show superior classification performance compared to traditional features.RBF kernel of SVM shows promising results for classification of colon cancer data.},

abstract = {We present a novel image-analysis based method for automatically distinguishing low, intermediate, and high grades of breast cancer in digitized histopathology. A multiple level feature set, including pixel-, object-, and semantic-level features derived from convolutional neural networks (CNN), is extracted from 106 hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy tissue studies from 106 women patients. These multi-level features allow not only characterization of cancer morphology, but also extraction of structural and interpretable information within the histopathological images. In this study, an improved hybrid active contour model based segmentation method was used to segment nuclei from the images. The semantic-level features were extracted by a CNN approach, which described the proportions of nuclei belonging to the different grades, in conjunction with pixel-level (texture) and object-level (architecture) features, to create an integrated set of image attributes that can potentially outperform either subtype of features individually. We utilized a cascaded approach to train multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using combinations of feature subtypes to enable the possibility of maximizing the performance by leveraging different feature sets extracted from multiple levels. Final class (cancer grade) was determined by combining the scores produced by the individual SVM classifiers. By employing a light (three-layer) CNN model and parallel computing, the presented approach is computationally efficient and applicable to large-scale datasets. The method achieved an accuracy of 0.92 for low versus high, 0.77 for low versus intermediate, and 0.76 for intermediate versus high, and an overall accuracy of 0.69 when discriminating low, intermediate, and high grades of histopathological breast cancer images. This suggested that our grading method could be useful in developing a computational diagnostic tool for differentiating breast cancer grades, which might enable objective and reproducible alternative for diagnosis. HighlightsAn automated breast cancer grading method in histopathology is presented.Multi-level features are extracted to capture histomorphometric attributes in histology.The grading method greatly improves the breast cancer grading performance.},

abstract = {Blood leucocytes segmentation in medical images is viewed as difficult process due to the variability of blood cells concerning their shape and size and the difficulty towards determining location of Blood Leucocytes. Physical analysis of blood tests to recognize leukocytes is tedious, time-consuming and liable to error because of the various morphological components of the cells. Segmentation of medical imagery has been considered as a difficult task because of complexity of images, and also due to the non-availability of leucocytes models which entirely captures the probable shapes in each structures and also incorporate cell overlapping, the expansive variety of the blood cells concerning their shape and size, various elements influencing the outer appearance of the blood leucocytes, and low Static Microscope Image disparity from extra issues outcoming about because of noise. We suggest a strategy towards segmentation of blood leucocytes using static microscope images which is a resultant of three prevailing systems of computer vision fiction: enhancing the image, Support vector machine for segmenting the image, and filtering out non ROI (region of interest) on the basis of Local binary patterns and texture features. Every one of these strategies are modified for blood leucocytes division issue, in this manner the subsequent techniques are very vigorous when compared with its individual segments. Eventually, we assess framework based by compare the outcome and manual division. The findings outcome from this study have shown a new approach that automatically segments the blood leucocytes and identify it from a static microscope images. Initially, the method uses a trainable segmentation procedure and trained support vector machine classifier to accurately identify the position of the ROI. After that, filtering out non ROI have proposed based on histogram analysis to avoid the non ROI and chose the right object. Finally, identify the blood leucocytes type using the texture feature. The performance of the foreseen approach has been tried in appearing differently in relation to the system against manual examination by a gynaecologist utilizing diverse scales. A total of 100 microscope images were used for the comparison, and the results showed that the proposed solution is a viable alternative to the manual segmentation method for accurately determining the ROI. We have evaluated the blood leucocytes identification using the ROI texture (LBP Feature). The identification accuracy in the technique used is about 95.3%., with 100 sensitivity and 91.66% specificity.},

abstract = {Physical defects reduce the organic solar cells (OSC) functioning. Throughout the OSC fabrication process, the defects can occur, for instance, by scratches or uneven morphologies. In general, bulk defects, interface defects, and interconnect defects can promote shunt and series resistance of the cell. It is crucial to properly detect and classify such defects and their amount in the structure. Correlating such defects with the performance of the cell is important both during the R&amp;D stages to optimize processes, and for mass production stages where defects detection is an integral part of the production line. For the recognition of texture variations in the scanning electron microscope images caused by these defects is crucial the definition of a set of features for texture representation. Because the low‐order Zernike moments can represent the whole shape of the image and the high‐order Zernike moments can describe the detail. Then, in our case, the feature of the image can be represented by a small number of Zernike moments. In fact, the feature set extracted and described by the Zernike moments are not sensitive to the noises and are hardly redundant. So it possible concentrate the signal energy over a set of few vectors. Finally, for classification, an elliptical basis function neural networks was used. The results show effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In fact, we obtained correct classification of 89.3% over testing data set.},

abstract = {Identifying locations of protein expression in live cells plays an important role in several medical applications ranging from early disease diagnosis to monitoring effectiveness of drugs. Protein localization is directly related to their cell types. Today florescence imaging is widely used to understand biology at the cellular level. Hence, cell phenotype classification in fluorescence microscope images, is related with protein localization. Today it is performed by human, which is very time consuming with low accuracy. According to the visual structure, it can be seen that samples of a unique cell type have quite similar texture, but the texture of different cell types, are very different. In this respect, texture information can be used more widely than shape or color information, to classify types. Local ternary pattern is a noise-resistant texture descriptor that provides discriminative features. In this paper a local texture analysis descriptor is proposed titled multi threshold uniform-based local ternary patterns with notation MT-ULTP. MT-ULTP extracts local significant texture information in different locality levels. In this respect, local ternary patterns are extracted in different thresholds and finally the occurrence probability of the uniform patterns is extracted as features. MT-ULTP is a skillful combination of LTP and MLBP with novelty in feature extracting and local pattern selecting. Performance of the proposed descriptor is evaluated on 2d-hela dataset in terms of accuracy. 2d-hela is the benchmark dataset of cell phenotype images. Experimental results show that MT-ULTP provides higher classification rates than very well-known texture descriptors such as lbp-like descriptors. In other experiments, it has been shown that ignoring uniform textural patterns in the image analysis can increase the accuracy of cell phenotype classification and some other computer vision-based applications. The results also showed that extraction uniform patterns based on a combination of thresholds provide better results than the simple form in local ternary patterns. The proposed image texture descriptor is a general case which can be used in many computer vision applications to describe the image contents.},

Retina is a stable biometric feature because of its location and unique physiological characteristics. In this paper, we propose a texture feature-based retinal authentication system. Texture features are considered as important features for authentication purpose. These texture features of retina are extracted using local configuration pattern LCP and Radon transform technique. The LCP computes the local structural information as well as the microscopic information of the image. Using Radon transform on retinal images, Radon features are extracted which contains the texture information of the blood vessels. A feature vector is formed by combining all theses LCP and Radon features and then fed to a feed-forward artificial neural network FANN classifier. This stage checks whether the test image belongs to the authorised person or not. Three general retinal databases DRIVE, HRF, Messidor, and images collected from two local eye hospitals are considered to authenticate a person. Two retinal authentication databases RIDB and VARIA are also used for evaluating the performance of the system. The results obtained show that the system is effective and efficient in authenticating the individuals.},

abstract = {A quantitative image analysis method to quantify cellular cytoskeleton changes.The method segments cell parts using maker-controlled watershed segmentation.Morphological operation, distance transform and post-processing play important roles.Two texture analysis methods quantify several cytoskeletal features in tumor.It can be used to test different biological hypothesis using cellular image sample. The cellular cytoskeleton is a dynamic subcellular structure that can be a marker of key biological phenomena including cell division, organelle movement, shape changes and locomotion during the avascular tumor phase. Little attention is paid to quantify changes in the cytoskeleton while nuclei and cytoplasmic both are present in subcellular microscopic images. In this paper, we proposed a quantitative image analysis method to analyze subcellular cytoskeletal changes using a texture analysis method preceded by segmentation of nuclei, cytoplasm and ruffling regions (area except nuclei and cytoplasm). To test and validate this model we hypothesized that Mammary Serine Protease Inhibitor (maspin) acts as cytoskeleton regulator that mediates cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion in tumor. Maspin-a tumor suppressor gene shows multiple tumor suppressive properties such as increasing tumor cell apoptosis and reducing migration, proliferation, invasion, and overall tumor metastasis. The proposed method obtained separated ruffling regions from segmentation steps and then adopted graylevel histograms (GLH) and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analysis techniques. In order to verify the reliability, the proposed texture analysis method was used to compare the control and maspin expressing cells grown on different ECM components: plastic, collagen I, fibronectin and laminin. The results show that the texture parameters extracted reflect the different cytoskeletal changes. These changes indicate that maspin acts as a regulator of the cell-ECM enhancement process, while it reduces the cell migration. Overall, this paper not only presents a quantitative image analysis approach to analyze subcellular cytoskeletal architectures but also provides a comprehensive tool for the biologist, pathologist, cancer specialist, and computer scientist to understand cellular and subcellular organization of cells. In long term, this method can be extended to be used in live cell tracking in vivo, image informatics based point-of-care expert system and quantification of various complex architectures in organisms.},

abstract = {The morphology of wear particles reflects the complex properties of wear processes involved in particle formation. Typically, the morphology of wear particles is evaluated qualitatively based on microscopy observations. This procedure relies upon the experts’ knowledge and, thus, is not always objective and cheap. With the rapid development of computer image processing technology, neural network based on traditional gradient training algorithm can be used to recognize them. However, the feedforward neural network based on traditional gradient training algorithms for image segmentation creates many issues, such as needing multiple iterations to converge and easy fall into local minimum, which restrict its development heavily. Recently, extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) has been attracting attentions for its faster learning speed and better generalization performance than those of traditional gradient-based learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose to employ ELM for ferrography wear particles image recognition. We extract the shape features, color features, and texture features of five typical kinds of wear particles as the input of the ELM classifier and set five types of wear particles as the output of the ELM classifier. Therefore, the novel ferrography wear particle classifier is founded based on ELM.},

abstract = {This paper presents an automatic mitosis detection approach of histopathology slide imaging based on using neutrosophic sets (NS) and moth-flame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach consists of two main phases, namely candidate's extraction and candidate's classification phase. At candidate's extraction phase, Gaussian filter was applied to the histopathological slide image and the enhanced image was mapped into the NS domain. Then, morphological operations have been implemented to the truth subset image for more enhancements and focus on mitosis cells. At candidate's classification phase, several features based on statistical, shape, texture and energy features were extracted from each candidate. Then, a principle of the meta-heuristic MFO algorithm was adopted to select the best discriminating features of mitosis cells. Finally, the selected features were used to feed the classification and regression tree (CART). A benchmark dataset consists of 50 histopathological images was adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The adopted dataset consists of five distinct breast pathology slides. These slides were stained with H&amp;E acquired by Aperio XT scanners with 40-x magnification. The total number of mitoses in 50 database images is 300, which were annotated by an expert pathologist. Experimental results reveal the capability of the MFO feature selection algorithm for finding the optimal feature subset which maximizing the classification performance compared to well-known and other meta-heuristic feature selection algorithms. Also, the high obtained value of accuracy, recall, precision and f-score for the adopted dataset prove the robustness of the proposed mitosis detection and classification approach. It achieved overall 65.42 % f-score, 66.03 % recall, 65.73 % precision and accuracy 92.99 %. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is fast, robust, efficient and coherent. Moreover, it could be used for further early diagnostic suspicion of breast cancer.},

abstract = {When trying to identify a printed forged document, examining digital evidence can prove to be a challenge. In this study, microscopic images are used for printed source identification due to their high magnification properties resulting in detailed texture and structure information. Prior research implemented a scanner as a digitizing technique to resolve very fine printed identification, but this technique provided limited information on the resolution and magnification of the sample. In contrast, the performance of microscopy techniques can retrieve the shape and surface texture of a printed document with differing micro structures among printer sources. To explore the relationship between source printers and images obtained by the microscope, the proposed approach utilizes image processing techniques and data exploration methods to calculate many important statistical features, including: Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Spatial filters, the Wiener filter, the Gabor filter, Haralick, and SFTA features. Among the different set of features, the LBP approach achieves the highest identification rate and is significantly superior to other methods. As a result, the proposed technique using microscopic images achieves a high classification accuracy rate, which shows promising applications for real world digital forensics research.},

The assessment of the state of the acrosome is a priority in artificial insemination centres since it is one of the main causes of function loss. In this work, boar spermatozoa present in gray scale images acquired with a phase-contrast microscope have been classified as acrosome-intact or acrosome-damaged, after using fluorescent images for creating the ground truth. Based on shape prior criteria combined with Otsu's thresholding, regional minima and watershed transform, the spermatozoa heads were segmented and registered. One of the main novelties of this proposal is that, unlike what previous works stated, the obtained results show that the contour information of the spermatozoon head is important for improving description and classification. Other of this work novelties is that it confirms that combining different texture descriptors and contour descriptors yield the best classification rates for this problem up to date. The classification was performed with a Support Vector Machine backed by a Least Squares training algorithm and a linear kernel. Using the biggest acrosome intact-damaged dataset ever created, the early fusion approach followed provides a 0.9913 F-Score, outperforming all previous related works.},

abstract = {The copper based semiconductors have now proved to the most promising solar cell material nowadays among all the available p type semiconducting materials. Present work deals with fabrication of thin film layer of CuO and CuS material on to a glass substrate by physical vapour deposition method. The structural, surface morphological, compositional, optical and electrical characterization of the fabricated thin films is to be carried out with the help of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, UV–visible spectrophotometer and I–V characterization respectively confirms the formation of CuO and CuS film on glass substrate.The structural property of CuO and CuS are obtained from XRD pattern. Both CuO and CuS material obtained are of crystalline nature with monolithic and hexagonal structure respectively. The surface morphology of CuO films shows that as the temperature increases, the fabricated film shows prominent granular texture and CuS film surface shows flower like texture. The optical band gap of CuO varies from 1.56 to 1.78&nbsp;eV as the temperature decrease from 450 °C to 350 °C. The band gap of CuS lies within the range of 2.50&nbsp;eV. The contact resistivity and bulk resistivity of CuO sample (S1) is 7.3 \texttimes{} 10–4 Ω&nbsp;m2 and 2.4 \texttimes{} 10–4 Ω&nbsp;m respectively. The contact resistivity and bulk resistivity of CuS sample (S4) is 5.1 \texttimes{} 10–4 Ω&nbsp;m2 and 1.27 \texttimes{} 10–4 Ω&nbsp;m respectively. The I–V characteristics curve of CuO and CuS obtained shows the semiconducting behaviour of the thin film formed; both in the forward bias and reverse bias region.},

abstract = {Diagnosis and Prognosis of brain tumour in children is always a critical case. Medulloblastoma is that subtype of brain tumour which occurs most frequently amongst children. Post-operation, the classification of its subtype is most vital for further clinical management. In this paper a novel approach of pathological subtype classification using biological interpretable and computer-aided textural features is forwarded. The classifier for accurate features prediction is built purely on the feature set obtained by segmentation of the ground truth cells from the original histological tissue images, marked by an experienced pathologist. The work is divided into five stages: marking of ground truth, segmentation of ground truth images, feature extraction, feature reduction and finally classification. Kmeans colour segmentation is used to segment out the ground truth cells from histological images. For feature extraction we used morphological, colour and textural features of the cells followed by feature reduction using Principal Component Analysis. Finally both binary and multiclass classification is done using Support Vector Method (SVM). The classification was compared using six different classifiers and performance was evaluated employing five-fold cross-validation technique. The accuracy achieved for binary and multiclass classification before applying PCA were 95.4 and 62.1% and after applying PCA were 100 and 84.9% respectively. The run-time analysis are also shown. Results reveal that this technique of cell level classification can be successfully adopted as architectural view can be confusing. Moreover it conforms substantially to the pathologist's point of view regarding morphological and colour features, with the addition of computer assisted texture feature.},

In this paper an automatic intelligent computer-aided system is proposed for the diagnosis of Johne's disease, the system uses image analysis and computer vision techniques to extract features from two different microscopic images, then those features are classified using neural networks and K-nearest neighbour K-NN techniques to diagnose Johne's disease. The proposed system employs histopathological examination to extract 192 different texture features. The features are then reduced into only 8 features and classified using artificial neural networks ANN. The acid fast stain test is used to confirm the positive cases. The construction and testing of both models are carried out using a total of 294 microscopic images, 194 images for the histopathological examination test which produces an overall accuracy of 98.33%. The other 100 images are used for the acid fast stain test, and it achieves an accuracy of 96.97%.},

abstract = {Minimal distortion steganography is the most successful model for adaptive steganography, in which the cost function determines the security. Texture complexity is the major factor in defining cost function in images. In this paper, we proposed a method to improve the cost function of JPEG steganography by exploiting the texture in microscale. The proposed scheme is designed by using a “microscope” to highlight details in an image, so that distortion definition can be more refined. Linear unsharp masking acts as the microscope, because it can accentuate the texture region as well as maintain the original characteristics of images. Inter-block spreading rule is proposed to further strengthen the security. We improve the state-of-the-art schemes, J-UNIWARD and UERD, as J-UNIWARD has outstanding performance on resisting detection while UERD has significant lower computational complexity. In order to keep high efficiency of UERD, filtering in the DCT domain is introduced. Extending experiments show that in most cases the proposed methods (J-MSUNIWARD and MSUERD) can achieve a higher level of security than the original methods.},

The CAD system incorporates a multi-classifier system to maximize the diagnostic accuracy of classification. Thyroid histopathology images are provided as input to the CAD system. The input images are enhanced and the nuclei present in the images are segmented automatically. Shape and texture features are extracted from the segmented images. Classification of the features is studied using classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbor (K-nn) and closest matching rule (CMR) either as stand alone classifiers or as combinations to form multi-classifier systems. The multi-classifier system which provides the best accuracy is found out experimentally. The CAD system thus formed can be used as a second opinion to assist pathologists.},

abstract = {In the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology, it is important to be able to functionalize surfaces chemically for a wide variety of applications. Scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) are important instruments in this area used to measure the surface structure and chemistry with better than molecular resolution. Self-assembly is frequently used to create monolayers that redefine the surface chemistry in just a single-molecule-thick layer (Love et al. in Chem Rev 105(4):1103–1170, 2005; Nuzzo and Allara in J Am Chem Soc 105(13):4481–4483, 1983; Smith et al. in Prog Surf Sci 75(1):1–68, 2004). Indeed, STM images reveal rich information about the structure of self-assembled monolayers since they convey chemical and physical properties of the studied material. In order to assist in and to enhance the analysis of STM and other images (Thomas et al. in ACS Nano 10(5):5446–5451, 2016; Thomas et al. in ACS Nano 9(5):4734–4742, 2015), we propose and demonstrate an image processing framework that produces two image segmentations: One is based on intensities (apparent heights in STM images) and the other is based on textural patterns. The proposed framework begins with a cartoon + texture decomposition, which separates an image into its cartoon and texture components. Afterward, the cartoon image is segmented by a modified multiphase version of the local Chan–Vese model (Wang et al. in Pattern Recognit 43(3):603–618, 2010), while the texture image is segmented by a combination of 2D empirical wavelet transform and a clustering algorithm. Overall, our proposed framework contains several new features, specifically in presenting a new application of cartoon + texture decomposition and of the empirical wavelet transforms and in developing a specialized framework to segment STM images and other data. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we apply it to raw STM images of various monolayers and present their corresponding segmentation results.},

The proposed model started by, firstly, detection and isolation of (WBCs). This was performed by conversion of cell images from RGB to CMYK color space. Then histogram equalization followed by thresholding estimation by Zack algorithm was performed for segmentation of cells from the surrounding blood contents. Secondly, some features were extracted from the segmented cells, and they included color, shape, texture and hybrid features. Thirdly, social spider optimization algorithm (SSOA) was applied to select the most appropriate features. Finally, several classifiers were used to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The proposed model was applied to the well-known ALL-IDB2 dataset. The results show: firstly, the segmentation (identification and isolations) results were 99.23, 100 and 97.1% of segmentation accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, which is the highest among other published papers. Secondly, the classification accuracy of the proposed model was higher than the non-SSOA in most experiments. The proposed system achieved remarkable results; 95.23% of classification accuracy with a feature reduction ratio of about 50%, which is the highest among the most recent works on the same dataset.},

The article describes the design and development of a web-based distributed healthcare management system for medical information and quantitative evaluation of microscopic images using machine learning approach for malaria. In the proposed study, all the health-care centres are connected in a distributed computer network. Each peripheral centre manages its' own health-care service independently and communicates with the central server for remote assistance. The proposed methodology for automated evaluation of parasites includes pre-processing of blood smear microscopic images followed by erythrocytes segmentation. To differentiate between different parasites; a total of 138 quantitative features characterising colour, morphology, and texture are extracted from segmented erythrocytes. An integrated pattern classification framework is designed where four feature selection methods viz. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Chi-square, Information Gain, and RELIEF are employed with three different classifiers i.e. Naive Bayes', C4.5, and Instance-Based Learning (IB1) individually. Optimal features subset with the best classifier is selected for achieving maximum diagnostic precision. It is seen that the proposed method achieved with 99.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity by combining CFS and C4.5 in comparison with other methods. Moreover, the web-based tool is entirely designed using open standards like Java for a web application, ImageJ for image processing, and WEKA for data mining considering its feasibility in rural places with minimal health care facilities.},

abstract = {Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted Total count and differential count of leukocytes or white blood cells (WBC) in blood samples are very important pathological factors for diagnosing a disease. There are not enough pathological infrastructures in the remote places of India and other developing countries. The objective of this work is to design a system, compatible with telemedicine, for automatic calculation of the total count and differential count of WBC from the blood smear slides. Hemocytometer based WBC counting provides more accurate result than manual counting, but hemocytometer preparation process needs expertise. As this device is targeted for remote places, blood smear technique is adopted to reduce the overhead of the operator. In the proposed system, microscopic images of blood smear sample are processed to highlight the WBC for segmentation. Region segmentation procedure involves background scaling and redundant region elimination from the region set. After segmentation, the more accurate region boundary is restored by using gradient based region growing with neighbourhood influence. Individual regions are separately classified on the basis of shape, size, color and texture features independently using different fuzzy and non-fuzzy techniques. A final decision is taken by combining these classification results, which is a kind of hybridization. A set of rules has been generated for making final classification decision based on outputs from various classifiers. The sensitivity and specificity of the system are found to be 96.4% and 79.6%, respectively on a database of 150 blood smear slides collected from different health centres of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Kolkata, India.},

Diagnosis from histopathological images remains the "gold standard" for breast cancer. The complexity of breast cell histopathology (BCH) images makes reliable segmentation and classification hard. In this paper, an automatic quantitative image analysis technique of BCH images is proposed. For the nuclei segmentation, top-bottom hat transform is applied to enhance image quality. Wavelet decomposition and multi-scale region-growing (WDMR) are combined to obtain regions of interest (ROIs) thereby realizing precise location. A double-strategy splitting model (DSSM) containing adaptive mathematical morphology and Curvature Scale Space (CSS) corner detection method is applied to split overlapped cells for better accuracy and robustness. For the classification of cell nuclei, 4 shape-based features and 138 textural features based on color spaces are extracted. Optimal feature set is obtained by support vector machine (SVM) with chain-like agent genetic algorithm (CAGA). The proposed method was tested on 68 BCH images containing more than 3600 cells. Experimental results show that the mean segmentation sensitivity was 91.53% ( 4.05%) and specificity was 91.64% ( 4.07%). The classification performance of normal and malignant cell images can achieve 96.19% ( 0.31%) for accuracy, 99.05% ( 0.27%) for sensitivity and 93.33% ( 0.81%) for specificity. Combine wavelet decomposition and multi-scale region-growing for locating of ROI.Combine morphologic operation and CSS corner detection for segmentation of cells.Propose wrapper feature selection algorithm making samples good separability.Study selected features' correlation and importance on classification schemes.Can detect cancer from histopathological normal-appearing cells.},

abstract = {Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted This paper proposes a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system that semi-automatically segments and classifies H&amp;E-stained thyroid histopathology images into two classes: Normal Thyroid (NT) or Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) based on nuclear texture features. Our system segments the given histopathology image into different binary images using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Otsu's multilevel thresholding. From the segmented binary images, a binary image containing the nuclei is chosen manually. Nuclei are extracted from the manually selected binary image by imposing an area constraint and a roundness constraint. The intensity variations of pixels within the nuclei are quantified by extracting texture features. Variable Precision Rough Sets (VPRS)-based β-reduct is used to identify redundant features and generate rules. The rules are then stored in a rule base. A novel closest-matching-rule (CMR) algorithm is proposed to classify a new test sample as PTC or NT using the rules in the rule base. We verified experimentally that the proposed CAD system provides promising results and it is supposed to assist pathologists in their decisions.},

abstract = {Automated analysis of cervical cancer images is considered as an attractive research in the biological fields. Due to the intensive advances in the digital technology and the light microscopy, the cellular imaging requires the continuous growing importance. Sophisticated methods are adopted to isolate the nuclei from the cytoplasm based on the boundary estimation and the analysis of intensity of blue cells to improve the abnormality prediction. The cell-based segmentation evolved in research studies assures the automatic assistance with an assumption of a single cell. Previous work [21] concentrates on the segmentation of abnormal region on single-cell images. This paper extends that work into the multi-cell images with the addition of geometrical features. The complex cell structure, poor contrast, and overlapping affect the cell segmentation performance. This paper enhances the performance of single-cell segmentation with the integrated feature vectors of geometrical (area, cell size, cell intensity and the maximum intensity) and Gray level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to improve the abnormality level prediction.. Initially, the Neighborhood Concentric Filtering (NCF) is applied on the input slides to remove the noise present in the image and enhance the intensity level. Then, the initial level cluster formation and masking are performed on the noise-free image. The Optimal Weight Updating with the Multi-Level set (OWU-ML) estimates the Region of Interest (ROI) and segments the blue cell and cytoplasm. The clear analysis of blue cell indicates the exact classification of abnormal levels in the images. The combination of geometrical and GLCM extracts the texture pattern features of the blue cell, cytoplasm and the nucleus portions in the form of angle variations. Finally, the Neural Network-based RVM classifier predicts the classes of (normal and abnormal) cervical images. The integration of novel methods such as OWU-ML segmentation, GLCM + geometrical feature extraction and NN-RVM classification improves the abnormal prediction performance and assures the suitability in multi-cell cervical image handling in biological applications.},

abstract = {Govocitos is a software to automate the fish fecundity estimation using the stereological method.It is easy-to-handle and trustable, and it allows checking the calculations in every moment.It detects 64% of oocytes in an histological image of fish gonad, and 80% with expert supervision.Oocyte nucleus and stages are classified (84% and 87% of accuracy) using texture and color features. To estimate productivity of a fish stock, the precise determination of fish fecundity is essential. The stereological method accurately estimates fecundity from histological images of a fish gonad. For that purpose, a hexagonal grid is overlaid on the histological image and the number of grid points associated to each oocyte (reproductive cells) category and the number of oocytes in each category is counted. This process is done manually often using off-the-shelf software, but it is very time-consuming, requires specialized technicians, and does not allow to review the calculations. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the software Govocitos, which offers an easy and automatic way to estimate fecundity using the stereological method. Govocitos contains a module to automatically detects the matured oocytes in the slice (nearly 80% of oocytes are correctly detected) and a module to automatically classify the oocytes according to the presence/absence of nucleus (with 84% of accuracy) and to three development stages (with 87% of accuracy). It also provides a user friendly GUI that allows the experts to modify the outlines and classifications of oocytes, to calculate diameters, areas and roundness, to build diameter frequency histograms, to count the points and objects inside the grid, to estimate partial and potential fecundity and to export the data to files and into a database. In addition, Govocitos provides the possibility of varying grid characteristics, it can be trained to work with different species and it allows to check and supervise the calculations whenever needed including in a later point in time. Govocitos is a free software that can be downloaded from http://lia.ei.uvigo.es/daeira/software/govocitos or http://citius.usc.es/w/govocitos.},

abstract = {The authentication of natural medical herbs has crucial impact on the clinical curative effect. Much of these herbs have been ground into powders in the market, leading to the difficulty of identification. Microscopic images of these powders contain important evidences for identification. Currently identification based on these microscopic images are mostly conducted by manual observation. Identification aided by computer vision technique is an important research subject recently. These microscopic images usually contain variety of substance, and most of them are noises, thus the target segmentation is necessary for identification. An effective automatic target segmentation algorithm based on texture is proposed in this paper. Our method consists of two steps: "Preliminary Segmentation" and "Further Segmentation". Firstly, gradient transform and image fusion are conducted for image preprocessing, then each pixel is encoded into a feature vector based on texture and clustered into two groups: background and foreground. Secondly, taking the continuity of edge and the locality of target into consideration, energy equations are established, and maximum flow-minimum cut algorithm is applied to solve them. Three groups of images are tested to evaluate our method, and the experimental results show that our method achieves a better segmentation compared with Grab-Cut, and additionally user inter-action is not required in our method.},

abstract = {Histopathology is the gold standard for accurate diagnosis of cancer, tumors and similar diseases. Real-world pathological images, due to non-homogeneous nature and unorganized spatial intensity variations, are complex to analyze and classify. The major challenge in classifying pathological images is the complexity due to high intra-class variability and low inter-class variation in texture. Accuracy of histopathological image classification is highly dependent on the relevancy of the selected features to the problem. This paper is an effort in the same direction and presents an abstract feature based framework called abstract feature framework (AFF) to select optimal set of the most relevant features to classify pathological images. An abstract feature is created by identifying interlinked run-length texture features and grouping them. AFF is comprised of a new data structure called Abstract Feature Tree (AFT) and an algorithm for manipulating it. AFT is a tree structure in which nodes are abstract features. The Linkage Learning Algorithm for manipulating AFT is the brain of this framework and inspired by genetic algorithm. It creates better abstract features by first identifying interlinked abstract features and then combining them. This process is repeated until no improvement is found. On termination, the final list of abstract features is used for classifying pathological images. The proposed framework was tested on real-world histopathological meningioma dataset. Results obtained proved that the proposed framework outperformed the best-known rank-based feature selection techniques by using, on average, approximately three times less features to achieve 22% higher classification accuracy.},

abstract = {A method has been developed to automatically characterize the type of mineral phases by means of digital image analysis using optical properties of crystals. The method relies on microscope automation, digital image acquisition, image processing and analysis. Two hundred series of digital images were taken from 45 standard thin sections using a digital camera mounted on a conventional microscope and then transmitted to a computer.CIELab color space is selected for the processing, in order to effectively employ its well-defined color difference metric for introducing appropriate color-based feature. Seven basic optical properties of minerals (A. color; B. pleochroism; C. interference color; D. birefringence; E. opacity; F. isotropy; G. extinction angle) are redefined. The Local Binary Pattern (LBP) operator and modeling texture is integrated in the Mineral Identification (MI) scheme to identify homogeneous regions in microscopic images of minerals.The accuracy of mineral identification using the method was %99, %98, %96 and %95 for biotite, hornblende, quartz and calcite minerals, respectively. The method is applicable to other minerals and phases for which individual optical properties of crystals do not provide enough discrimination between the relevant phases. On the basis of this research, it can be concluded that if the CIELab color space and the local binary pattern (LBP) are applied, it is possible to recognize the mineral samples with the accuracy of more than 98%. Display Omitted A novel automated mineral identification (MI) scheme is developed.Weighted color and texture features are employed for the MI task.The scheme uses CIELab color space equipped with the well-defined color metric ΔE.A mineral database is developed considering alteration and indicatrix.},

abstract = {The paper summarizes the joint work of specialists in the fields of image analysis and ophthalmology over the last few years. As a result of this work, new mathematical methods for automating image analysis that have important diagnostic value for ophthalmology have been developed: (1) identification of the lipid layer state in the intermarginal space of human eyelids; (2) analysis of the degree of cellular structure density (cellularity) in the corneal tissue of human eyes; (3) identification of the state of the retinal blood flow when analyzing fluorescent angiograms of the human fundus; and (4) morphometric analysis of the state of the epithelium posterius (endothelium) in the human eye cornea. As initial data, we used (respectively) (1) images of imprints of the eyelid intermarginal space on a millipore filter upon their osmium vapor staining; (2) micrographs of corneal tissue specimens obtained using a light microscope; (3) fluorescent angiograms of the human fundus; and (4) images of endothelial cells obtained noninvasively using a confocal microscope. The developed methods are designed to extract morphometric data from these images. For each problem, the following results were obtained: (1) expectations and variances of pixel intensities on the imprint along a drawn line and over a selected region, as well as plots that characterize pixel intensity and change in the thickness of the imprint along a drawn line; (2) expectations and variances for the intensities of the selected regions and intensity histograms; (3) extracted vessels and ischemia zones with their statistical descriptions; and (4) detected cells of hexagonal, pentagonal, and other shapes, as well as a set of characteristics associated with the size of the cells detected. The developed methods are based on the fundamental results of the mathematical theory of image analysis and on the joint use of image processing, mathematical morphology, and mathematical statistics techniques. The paper also describes software implementations of the developed methods, including an automated research workstation for ophthalmologists, and presents the results of their experimental testing.},

To solve the above problems, an algorithm of oxidation defects detection based on topology mapping. First, the filter template of weighted average neighborhood closed curve based on topology mapping is used to remove the image noise. Second, an image segmentation method is proposed by using the idea of maximum variance between classes to find out the threshold, then the spatially filtered is used to remove the normal surface texture and the structure of the substrate which is introduced by metallographic microscope enlargement. Finally, experiments are performed to show that the filter template of weighted average neighborhood closed curve is better than the existing filters and effectively removes image noise, then the segmentation method in this paper works better.},

abstract = {The application of digital holography in cell imaging is gaining attraction as it gives quantitative information related to optical thickness without the need for staining. In contrast, conventional pathology examination uses tissues or cells that are stained to visualize the morphological structure or molecular expression with color. However, the relationship between color information and quantitative phase inside histopathology specimen is not yet well understood. In this study, we developed a system to capture both a color image and digital hologram, and those of H&amp;E (hematoxylin and eosin)-stained liver tissue were acquired. Then, we calculated and analyzed the relationship between the textural features inside the color and phase images for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) histopathological specimen. Upon experimental investigation, we found that gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features in phase images are useful for discriminating cancer and normal tissue, and varies between HCC grades which bring the possibility to be utilized for HCC diagnosis or classification without staining procedure.},

abstract = {Calibration of the lateral scale of scanning probe microscopes using conventional physical calibration standards (i.e. 1D or 2D gratings) has limitations for small scanning ranges imposed by the pitch of the standards. Below approximately 1µm the number of features on the standards that can be imaged is limited and the effects of imperfections from individual features increase the calibration uncertainty. Additionally, the standards consist of delicate nanostructures that are susceptible to contamination and damage. Due to this delicate nature these standards are less useful in a production environment. We present a lateral calibration method based on a virtual standard that is robust to contamination and damage and also enables the determination of scanner non-linearity. In contrast to conventional physical standards the accuracy of the virtual standard does not decrease for smaller scan ranges. The standard is based on a highly linear shear piezo and has no specific requirements for the surface texture that is used during the lateral calibration. The calibration of the shear piezo in the range from 2pm to 20nm with a dedicated interferometer and its application as an accurate virtual standard to calibrate the lateral scale and non-linearity of an atomic force microscope will be discussed.

abstract = {Microalgae counting is used to measure biomass quantity. Usually, it is performed in a manual way using a Neubauer chamber and expert criterion, with the risk of a high error rate. Scenedesmus algae can build coenobia consisting of 1, 2, 4 and 8 cells. The amount of algae of each coenobium helps to determine the amount of lipids, proteins, and other substances in a given sample of a algae crop. The knowledge of the quantity of those elements improves the quality of bioprocess applications. This paper addresses the methodology for automatic identification of Scenedesmus microalgae (used in the methane production and food industry) and applies it to images captured by a digital microscope. The use of contrast adaptive histogram equalization for pre-processing, and active contours for segmentation are presented. The calculation of statistical features (histogram of oriented gradients, Hu and Zernike moments) with texture features (Haralick and local binary patterns descriptors) are proposed for algae characterization. Classification of coenobia achieves accuracies of 98.63% and 97.32% with support vector machine and artificial neural network, respectively. According to the results, it is possible to consider the proposed methodology as an alternative to the traditional technique for algae counting. In addition, the database used for the developing of the proposed methodology is publicly available.},

abstract = {HEp-2 cell classification by texture descriptors.Fusions among dense sampling and dense descriptors.Perturbation approaches for building ensemble of texture descriptors. The classification of Human Epithelial (HEp-2) cells images, acquired through Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) microscopy, is an effective method to identify staining patterns in patient sera. Indeed it can be used for diagnostic purposes, in order to reveal autoimmune diseases. However, the automated classification of IIF HEp-2 cell patterns represents a challenging task, due to the large intra-class and the small inter-class variability. Consequently, recent HEp-2 cell classification contests have greatly spurred the development of new IIF image classification systems.Here we propose an approach for the automatic classification of IIF HEp-2 cell images by fusion of several texture descriptors by ensemble of support vector machines combined by sum rule. Its effectiveness is evaluated using the HEp-2 cells dataset used for the Performance Evaluation of Indirect Immunofluorescence Image Analysis Systems contest, hosted by the International Conference on Pattern Recognition in 2014: the accuracy on the testing set is 79.85%.The same dataset was used to test an ensemble of ternary-encoded local phase quantization descriptors, built by perturbation approaches: the accuracy on the training set is 84.16%. Finally, this ensemble was validated on 14 additional datasets, obtaining the best performance on 11 datasets.Our MATLAB code is available at https://www.dei.unipd.it/node/2357.},

abstract = {The differentiation of a cluster of nuclei and multi-nucleation is a critical issue in automated diagnosis systems. Due to the similarities between said clusters and malignant nuclei, misclassification of these regions can affect the automated systems' final decision. In this paper, a method for differentiating clusters from multi nucleated cells in histopathological images is proposed. Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) and Dysplasia are characterized by cellular and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism and multinucleation, which possess prominent threat Data was obtained from Global Hospital and Research Center from patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Dysplasia. This paper introduces a hybrid diagnosis method that uses texture, layout and context features of nuclei and cytoplastic cells in order to enhance the poor diagnosis of liver tumors in Infra Red (IR) images. We propose a Area based Adaptive Expectation Maximization(EM) that grows the clusters, which avoids the need for initial cluster selection in order to obtain texton maps of nuclei and cytoplasm. A linear regression model of nuclei and cytoplastic changes were built by incorporating the aforementioned features efficiently. The proposed method provides better classification and segmentation accuracy of nuclei and extra nuclear content in HCC and dysplasia, compared to the state-of-the-art methods like convolutional networks and classical methods like Adaptive K means and EM method in constant time. In conclusion, this system detects the malignant cells and the highly eligible precancerous cells which is cost effective and reproducible.},

In computer-aided diagnosis one of the crucial steps to classify suspicious lesions is the extraction of features. Texture analysis methods have been used in the analysis and interpretation of medical images. In this work we present a method based on the association among curvelet transform, local binary patterns, feature selection by statistical analysis and distinct classification methods, in order to support the development of computer aided diagnosis system. The similar features were removed by the statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA). The understanding of the features was evaluated by applying the decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and polynomial (PL) classifiers, considering the metrics accuracy (AC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC): the rates were calculated on images of breast tissues with different physical properties (commonly observed in clinical practice). The datasets were the Digital Database for Screening Mammography, Breast Cancer Digital Repository and UCSB biosegmentation benchmark. The investigated groups were normal-abnormal and benign-malignant. The association of curvelet transform, local binary pattern and ANOVA with the PL classifier achieved higher AUC and AC values for all cases: the obtained rates were among 91% and 100%. These results are relevant, specially when we consider the difficulties of clinical practice in distinguishing the studied groups. The proposed association is useful as an automated protocol for the diagnosis of breast tissues and may contribute to the diagnosis of breast tissues (mammographic and histopathological images).},

After synthesis, the nanostructures were coated with tetraethyl orthosilicate for stabilization purpose. Later on, these nanostructures were characterized by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to examine their size, shape and crystalline structure. The synthesized SiO2/Fe3O4 nanostructures with fine semi-spherical textures showed high heterogeneous catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) under microwave radiations. The effect of Different parameters such as concentration of reducing agent (NaBH4), quantity of catalyst applied and the effect of microwave irradiation time was evaluated to obtain good results for 4-nitrophenol reduction. The 99.5% 4-nitrophenol reduction was achieved by using 100 µg of SiO2/Fe3O4 nanocatalyst in a short reaction time. Furthermore, the 4-nitrophenol reduction process utilizing SiO2/Fe3O4 nanostructures as catalyst was very economical and efficient in term of ease of synthesis, low raw materials expenditure and fast recovery/separation of the catalyst using external magnetic field. Besides these characteristics the SiO2/Fe3O4 nanocatalyst is environment-friendly and bio compatible due to its extremely low toxicity. Based on the above characteristics, the SiO2/Fe3O4 nanocatalyst can find some potential applications as heterogeneous catalyst in environmentally and industrially important reactions.},

abstract = {In current consequence of haematology, blood cancer i.e. acute lymphoblastic leukemia is very frequently founded in medical practice, which is characterized by over activation and functional abnormality of bone marrow. The abnormality is identified through physical examination with a screening of blood smears. However, this method is error prone and labor intensive task for haematologist. Hence, haematologist needs a specific computer aided diagnostic system (CAD) that can deal with these limitations of prior systems and capable of discriminating immature leukemic cells from mature healthy cells. Thus, this work addresses the problem of segmenting a microscopic blood image into different regions, and then further analyzes those regions for localization of the immature lymphoblast cell. Further, it investigates the use of different geometrical, chromatic and statistical textures features for nucleus as well as cytoplasm and pattern recognition techniques for sub typing immature acute lymphoblasts as per FAB (French--- American --- British) classification. This can facilitate haematologist for acquiring essential information about prognosis and for an appropriate cure for leukemia. The exhaustive experiments have been conducted on 260 microscopic blood images (i.e. 130 normal and 130 cancerous cells) taken from ALL-IDB database. The proposed techniques consisting of the segmentation module used for segmenting the nucleus and cytoplasm of each leukocyte cell, feature extraction module, feature dimensionality reduction module that uses principal component analysis (PCA) to mapped the higher feature space to lower feature space and classification module that employs the standard classifiers, like support vector machines, smooth support vector machines, k-nearest neighbour, probabilistic neural network and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system.},

abstract = {The microscope is one of the widely used pathological equipment to analyze body fluids like blood, sputum, etc. in granular level. In order to reduce workload on pathologists and strengthen the telehealth services, an automatic self-focusing microscope with different field image collection mechanism is required. In this work, the conversion of a compound microscope into a complete digital self-focusing automatic microscope, with intelligent field image collection mechanism, is discussed. This method uses passive autofocusing technique. In this method, most informative regions are identified on the basis of texture information. Features from these identified regions are used for autofocusing the microscope. This system is capable of collecting multiple snaps from different regions of the smear sample slides. The problem with the smear slide is that it has un-uniform thickness upon the glass slide. So some region has a very thick layer and some region has a very thin layer. In general, both of these regions are not considered for pathological analysis. The proposed system is capable to detect the region of smear slide which is suitable for collection of snap images. A soft computing approach is used to detect the desired regions of the sample in the slide. The Raspberry pi is used to design the control section. Multi-threaded parallel programming is used to optimize I/O execution and waiting time. The performance of the proposed system is satisfactory. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is about 33 in comparison with manual focusing by the domain expert. The performance of the system in terms of computation time, which is calculated on the benchmark microscopic image dataset, is better than other learning-based methods. Autofocusing of pathological microscope with an intelligent field image collection mechanism is highly useful in the remote healthcare domain. This work basically describes a mechanism to migrate the conventional compound microscope into a tale-health service compatible (IoT enabled) microscope. This system is highly suitable for developing countries where an overall change of existing infrastructure is difficult due to economic reasons.},

According to the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, the diffusion behavior can be isotropic or orthotropic: for many materials, due to the complexity of the microscopic texture, the principal directions of orthotropy are not known a priori and enter the identification issue. After reviewing some identification methods (proper generalized decomposition) for isotropic and orthotropic material whose orthotropy directions are known, the paper proposes an experimental protocol and an identification algorithm for the full three-dimensional diffusion case, aiming at establishing the 3 coefficients of diffusion along the principal directions of orthotropy and the orientation of the orthotropic reference frame with respect to the sample frame. The identification of the physical properties is done through the minimization of a distance in the space of the physical parameters. The problem being non-convex, the numerical strategy used for the search of the global minimum is a particle swarm optimization, the code adaptive local evolution-particle swarm optimization with adaptive coefficients.},

abstract = {Background: Ongoing research into inflammatory conditions raises an increasing need to evaluate immune cells in histological sections in biologically relevant regions of interest (ROIs). Herein, we compare different approaches to automatically detect lobular structures in human normal breast tissue in digitized whole slide images (WSIs). This automation is required to perform objective and consistent quantitative studies on large data sets.Methods: In normal breast tissue from nine healthy patients immunohistochemically stained for different markers, we evaluated and compared three different image analysis methods to automatically detect lobular structures in WSIs: (1) a bottom-up approach using the cell-based data for subsequent tissue level classification, (2) a top-down method starting with texture classification at tissue level analysis of cell densities in specific ROIs, and (3) a direct texture classification using deep learning technology.Results: All three methods result in comparable overall quality allowing automated detection of lobular structures with minor advantage in sensitivity (approach 3), specificity (approach 2), or processing time (approach 1). Combining the outputs of the approaches further improved the precision.Conclusions: Different approaches of automated ROI detection are feasible and should be selected according to the individual needs of biomarker research. Additionally, detected ROIs could be used as a basis for quantification of immune infiltration in lobular structures. HighlightsThe detection of human breast lobular structures in whole slide images can be automated.Three analysis methods (bottom-up, top-down, CNN) are evaluated and compared.All three methods perform well according to quantitative and visual assessments.Precision can be improved by a combination scheme (pixel-level majority voting).},

We apply Transfer Learning from architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We modify the structures of CNNs to extract features from the images and input them to well-known machine learning methods: Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We evaluated 108 extractor–classifier combinations. The one that achieved the best results is DenseNet169 with SVM (RBF), reaching an Accuracy of 92.083% and F1-Score of 92.117%. Therefore, our approach is capable of distinguishing tissues found in CRC histopathological evaluation.},

abstract = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) becomes a common tool for identifying diseases, especially various cancers, from medical images. Thus, digital image processing plays a significant role in this research area. This paper concerns with developing an efficient automatic system for the identification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. The proposed approach involves two steps. The first step focuses on segmenting the white blood cells (WBCs). In the second step, significant features such as shape, geometrical, statistical, and discrete cosine transform (DCT) are extracted from the segmented cells. Various classification techniques are applied to the extracted features to classify the segmented cells into normal and abnormal cells. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated via extensive experiments conducted on the well-known ALL-IDB dataset of microscopic images of blood. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach realizes an accuracy rate 97.45% and outperforms other existing approaches.},

abstract = {Automated histopathological image analysis is a challenging problem due to the complex morphological structure of histopathology images. Bag-of-features is one of the prominent image representation methods which has been successfully applied in histopathological image analysis. There are four phases in the bag-of-features method, namely feature extraction, codebook construction, feature encoding, and classification. Out of which feature encoding is one of the prime phases. In feature encoding phase, images are represented in terms of visual words before feeding into support vector machine classifier. However, the feature encoding phase of the bag-of-features framework considers the one feature to encode each image in terms of visual words due to which the system can not use the merits of other features. Therefore, to improve the efficacy of the bag-of-features framework, a new weighted two-dimensional vector quantisation encoding method is proposed in this work. The proposed method is tested on two histopathological image datasets for classification. The experimental results show that the combination of SIFT and ORB features with two dimensional vector quantisation encoding method returns 80.13% and 77.13% accuracy on ADL and Blue Histology datasets respectively which is better than other considered encoding methods.},

The classification of such images is a challenging task due to the presence of several morphological structures in the tissue images. Recently, bag-of-features method has been used for image classification tasks. However, bag-of-features method uses K-means algorithm to cluster the features, which is a sensitive algorithm towards the initial cluster centres and often traps into the local optima. Therefore, in this work, an efficient bag-of-features histopathological image classification method is presented using a novel variant of salp swarm algorithm termed as random salp swarm algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed variant has been validated against 20 benchmark functions. Further, the performance of the proposed method has been studied on blue histology image dataset and the results are compared with 5 other state-of-the-art meta-heuristic based bag-of-features methods.

abstract = {The combination of tissue-engineered bone scaffolds with osteogenic induction molecules is an important strategy for critical-sized bone defects repair. We synthesized a novel thiolated chitosan/calcium carbonate composite microsphere (TCS-P24/CA) scaffold as a carrier for bone morphogenetic protein 2- (BMP2-) derived peptide P24 and evaluated the release kinetics of P24. The effect of TCS-P24/CA scaffolds on the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) was evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), CCK-8, ALP assay, alizarin red staining, and PCR. A 5 mm diameter calvarial defect was created, then new bone formation was evaluated by Micro-CT and histological examination at 4 and 8 weeks after operation. We found the sequential release of P24 could last for 29 days. Meanwhile, BMSCs revealed spindle-shaped surface morphology, indicating the TCS-P24/CA scaffolds could support cell adhesion and mRNA levels for ALP, Runx2, and COL1a1 were significantly upregulated on TCS-10%P24/CA scaffold compared with other groups in vitro (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, the BMSCs exhibited a higher ALP activity as well as calcium deposition level on TCS-10%P24/CA scaffolds compared with other groups (p&lt;0.05). Analysis of in vivo bone formation showed that the TCS-10%P24/CA scaffold induced more bone formation than TCS-5%P24/CA, TCS/CA, and control groups. This study demonstrates that the novel TCS-P24/CA scaffolds might contribute to the delivery of BMP2-derived Peptide P24 and is considered to be a potential candidate for repairing bone defects.},

abstract = {The possibility of obtaining calcium carbonate nanoparticles from Achatina fulica shell through mechanochemical synthesis to be used as a modifying filler for polymer materials has been studied. The process of obtaining calcium carbonate nanopowders includes two stages: dry and wet milling processes. At the first stage, the collected shell was dry milled and undergone mechanical sieving to ≤50 μm. The shell particles were wet milled afterward with four different solvents (water, methanol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol) and washed using the decantation method. The particle size and shape were investigated on transmission electron microscopy, and twenty-three particle counts were examined using an iTEM image analyzer. Significantly, nanoparticle sizes ranging from 11.56 to 180.06 nm of calcium carbonate was achieved after the dry and wet milling processes. The size particles collected vary with the different solvents used, and calcium carbonate synthesis with ethanol offered the smallest organic particle size with the average size ranging within 13.48-42.90 nm. The effect of the solvent on the chemical characteristics such as the functional group, elemental composition, and carbonate ion of calcium carbonate nanopowders obtained from Achatina fulica shell was investigated. The chemical characterization was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDX). The effect of milling procedures on the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, stiffness, and hardness of prepared nanocomposites was also determined. This technique has shown that calcium carbonate nanoparticles can be produced at low cost, with low agglomeration, uniformity of crystal morphology, and structure from Achatina fulica shell. It also proved that the solvents used for milling have no adverse effect on the chemical properties of the nano-CaCO3 produced. The loading of calcium carbonate nanoparticles, wet milled with different solvents, exhibited different mechanical properties, and nanocomposites filled with methanol-milled nano-CaCO3 offered superior mechanical properties.},

abstract = {At present, the burning problem of low power burners widely used in emergency and stove heating on the plateau has gradually attracted people’s attention. The fuel injection pressure, inlet air flow, air distribution regulation coefficient, and environmental pressure were considered respectively, and then the four factors and six levels of a uniform experimental investigation were conducted in a low-pressure chamber with adjustable atmospheric pressure. The flame morphology, flame temperature, and NO emission were investigated, and their correlation with each independent variable was analyzed. In addition, burning of droplet swarm was obtained with the simulate numerical calculation by the ANSYS FLUENT. The results showed that the low-pressure environment had a negative correlation with the maximum width and position of flame, the characteristics of flame uplifted and NO emission. Air volume determines the length of the flame, and atmospheric pressure and fuel injection pressure determine the maximum width of the flame. The shape of the horizontal jet flame in plateau environment is more dependent on the regulation of air volume. In order to reduce NO emission in plateau environment, it may be necessary to maintain a large air supply volume and reduce fuel injection pressure appropriately. At the microscopic level of droplet combustion, change mechanisms of macro flame shape in different sub-atmosphere were analyzed. The mechanism of flame morphological change in the plateau environment is the increase in droplet burning time and path. The adjustment of flame under sub-atmospheric pressure through the change of operating parameters is essential to improve the burning rate of droplets.},

abstract = {Along with developing modern technology, the demands for optical element surface develop towards the characteristics of large scale and high precision. However, it is challenging to evaluate the surface defects since some shallow scratches in optical element surface images are usually characterized by low contrast and blurry outlines. This property makes the machine vision inspection extremely difficult. So, this paper proposes a novel multi-scale line detection method that can efficiently extract shallow scratches. Firstly, to decrease the influence of the surrounding region, a new multi-scale line detector combines all the responses at different scales by setting different weights for each scale. Then, based on the scratches features, we utilize morphological operations to get the full continuum of the scratches area. Experimental results show that our model can ideally extract the contours of shallow scratches that are very close to the optical microscope results observed by specialists.},

In this work, we present an automated technique for detection of cellular nuclei in hematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology images. Our proposed approach is based on kernelized correlation filters. Correlation filters have been widely used in object detection and tracking applications but their strength has not been explored in the medical imaging domain up till now. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme gives state of the art accuracy and can learn complex nuclear morphologies. Like deep learning approaches, the proposed filters do not require engineering of image features as they can operate directly on histopathology images without significant preprocessing. However, unlike deep learning methods, the large-margin correlation filters developed in this work are interpretable, computationally efficient and do not require specialized or expensive computing hardware.

In this research, we propose an intelligent decision support system for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) diagnosis using microscopic images. Two Bare-bones Particle Swarm Optimization (BBPSO) algorithms are proposed to identify the most significant discriminative characteristics of healthy and blast cells to enable efficient ALL classification. The first BBPSO variant incorporates accelerated chaotic search mechanisms of food chasing and enemy avoidance to diversify the search and mitigate the premature convergence of the original BBPSO algorithm. The second BBPSO variant exhibits both of the abovementioned new search mechanisms in a subswarm-based search.

abstract = {To diagnose breast cancer, the number of mitotic cells present in histology sections is an important indicator for examining and grading biopsy specimen. This study aims at improving the accuracy of automated mitosis detection by characterizing mitotic cells in wavelet based multi-resolution representations via a non-Gaussian modeling method. The potential mitosis candidates were decomposed into multi-scale forms by an undecimated dual-tree complex wavelet transform. Two non-Gaussian models (the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) and the symmetric alpha-stable (SS) distributions) were used to accurately model the heavy-tailed behavior of wavelet marginal distributions. The method was evaluated on two independent data cohorts, including the benchmark dataset (MITOS), via a support vector machine classifier. The quantitative results shows that the bivariate SS model achieved superior classification performance with the area under the curve value of 0.82 in comparison with 0.79 for bivariate GGD, 0.77 for univariate SS, 0.72 for univariate GGD, and 0.59 for Gaussian model. Since both mitotic and non-mitotic cells appear as small objects with a large variety of shapes, characterization of mitosis is a hard problem. The inter-scale dependencies of wavelet coefficients allowing extraction of salient features within the cells that are more likely to appear at all different scales were captured by the bivariate non-Gaussian models, leading to more accurate detection results. The presented automated mitosis detection method might assist pathologists in enhancing the operational efficiency and productivity as well as improving diagnostic confidence. HighlightsAn automated mitosis detection method in histopathology is presented.Non-Gaussian models are used to capture the salient features within mitotic cells.The bivariate models improve the mitosis detection performance.},

abstract = {A new method for segmenting elastic fibres in histological images is presented.Shape features are analysed to improve the identification of elastic fibres.Quantification of the vessel wall area and the elastic fibres area can be computed easily.The results are satisfactory based on sensitivity and specificity values, and according to the subjective evaluation by a team of medical specialists.The method can be executed on portable personal computers. Background and objectiveThe elastic fibres are an essential component of the extracellular matrix in blood vessel walls that allows a long-range of deformability and passive recoil without energy input. The quantitative determination of elastic fibres will provide information on the state of the vascular wall and to determine the role and behaviour of this key structural element in different physiological and pathological vascular processes. MethodsWe present a segmentation method to identify and quantify elastic fibres based on a local threshold technique and some morphological characteristics measured on the segmented objects that facilitate the discrimination between elastic fibres and other image components. The morphological characteristics analysed are the thickness and the length of an object. ResultsThe segmentation method was evaluated using an image database of vein sections stained with Weigert's resorcinfuchsin. The performance results are based on a ground truth generated manually resulting in values of sensitivity greater than 80% with the exception in two samples, and specificity values above 90% for all samples. Medical specialists carried out a visual evaluation where the observations indicate a general agreement on the segmentation results visual quality, and the consistency between the methodology proposed and the subjective observation of the doctors for the evaluation of pathological changes in vessel wall. ConclusionsThe proposed methodology provides more objective measurements than the qualitative methods traditionally used in the histological analysis, with a significant potential for this method to be used as a diagnostic aid for many other vascular pathological conditions and in similar tissues such as skin and mucous membranes.},

abstract = {The analysis of pathophysiological change to erythrocytes is important for early diagnosis of anaemia. The manual assessment of pathology slides is time-consuming and complicated regarding various types of cell identification. This paper proposes an ensemble rule-based decision-making approach for morphological classification of erythrocytes. Firstly, the digital microscopic blood smear images are pre-processed for removal of spurious regions followed by colour normalisation and thresholding. The erythrocytes are segmented from background image using the watershed algorithm. The shape features are then extracted from the segmented image to detect shape abnormality present in microscopic blood smear images. The decision about the abnormality is taken using proposed multiple rule-based expert systems. The deciding factor is majority ensemble voting for abnormally shaped erythrocytes. Here, shape-based features are considered for nine different types of abnormal erythrocytes including normal erythrocytes. Further, the adaptive boosting algorithm is used to generate multiple decision tree models where each model tree generates an individual rule set. The supervised classification method is followed to generate rules using a C4.5 decision tree. The proposed ensemble approach is precise in detecting eight types of abnormal erythrocytes with an overall accuracy of 97.81% and weighted sensitivity of 97.33%, weighted specificity of 99.7%, and weighted precision of 98%. This approach shows the robustness of proposed strategy for erythrocytes classification into abnormal and normal class. The article also clarifies its latent quality to be incorporated in point of care technology solution targeting a rapid clinical assistance.},

abstract = {Manual analyzing and interpreting of the microscopic images of thin blood smears for diagnosis of the malaria is a tedious and challenging task. This paper aims to develop a computer assisted system for quantification of erythrocytes in microscopic images of thin blood smears. The proposed method consists of preprocessing, segmentation, morphological filtering, cell separation and clump cell segmentation. The major issues, required to be addressed to enhance the performance of the system are cell separation (i.e. isolated and clump erythrocytes classification) and clump cell segmentation. The geometric features such as cell area, compactness ratio and aspect ratio have been used to define the feature set. Further, the performance of the system in classifying the isolated and clump erythrocytes is evaluated for the different classifiers such as Naive Bayes, k-NN and SVM. Moreover, the clump erythrocytes are segmented using marker controlled watershed with h-minima as internal marker. Based on the experimental results, it may be concluded that the proposed model provides satisfactory results with an accuracy of 98.02% in comparison to the state of art method.},

A solution of 60 mM concentration (by mixing zinc acetate with ethyl alcohol) is made for seed layer deposition. The main growth of pure ZnO and Mg [2 and 5 weight percent (wt%)] doped ZnO nanorod films were done after growing seed layer of undoped ZnO. The structural morphology of the pure and Mg doped ZnO nanorod (NR) films were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. All the NRs were grown well on the ZnO seed layers and their top surface was hexagonal in shape. The electrical characterization of the Pd/ZnO and Pd/MgZnO NR Schottky contacts were studied by using microprobe arrangements. The values of ideality factor, barrier height and reverse saturation current were calculated from I to V characteristics of Schottky diodes. The study demonstrates that Pd/ZnO and Pd/MgZnO NR Schottky contacts fabricated by a simple and inexpensive method can be used as a substitute of conventional Schottky diodes for optoelectronic applications.},

abstract = {A fully automatic, efficient, real-time corneal sub-basal nerve segmentation and morphological parameter quantification system is developed.This system underpins the expertise of ophthalmologists.A new algorithm has been proposed to calculate the average nerve thickness.An efficient technique is proposed to connect the discontinuous nerves.A clinically helpful diagnostic system for busy clinic and patient care is developed. Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common types of diabetes that can affect the cornea. An accurate analysis of the nerve structures can assist the early diagnosis of this disease. This paper proposes a robust, fast and fully automatic nerve segmentation and morphometric parameter quantification system for corneal confocal microscope images. The segmentation part consists of three main steps. First, a preprocessing step is applied to enhance the visibility of the nerves and remove noise using anisotropic diffusion filtering, specifically a Coherence filter followed by Gaussian filtering. Second, morphological operations are applied to remove unwanted objects in the input image such as epithelial cells and small nerve segments. Finally, an edge detection step is applied to detect all the nerves in the input image. In this step, an efficient algorithm for connecting discontinuous nerves is proposed. In the morphometric parameters quantification part, a number of features are extracted, including thickness, tortuosity and length of nerve, which may be used for the early diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy and when planning Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) or Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). The performance of the proposed segmentation system is evaluated against manually traced ground-truth images based on a database consisting of 498 corneal sub-basal nerve images (238 are normal and 260 are abnormal). In addition, the robustness and efficiency of the proposed system in extracting morphometric features with clinical utility was evaluated in 919 images taken from healthy subjects and diabetic patients with and without neuropathy. We demonstrate rapid (13 seconds/image), robust and effective automated corneal nerve quantification. The proposed system will be deployed as a useful clinical tool to support the expertise of ophthalmologists and save the clinician time in a busy clinical setting.},

Water pollution by organic materials or metals is one of the problems that threaten humanity, both nowadays and over the next decades. Morphological changes in Nile Tilapia "Oreochromis niloticus" fish liver and gills can also represent the adaptation strategies to maintain some physiological functions or to assess acute and chronic exposure to chemicals found in water and sediments. This paper presents an automatic system for assessing water quality, in Sharkia Governorate - Egypt, based on microscopic images of fish gills and liver. The proposed system used fish gills and liver as hybrid-biomarker in order to detect water pollution. It utilized case-based reasoning (CBR) for indicating the degree of water quality based on the different histopathological changes in fish gills and liver microscopic images. Various performance evaluation metrics namely, retrieval accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, F-measure, and G-mean have been used in order to objectively indicate the true performance of the system considering the unbalanced data. Experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid-biomarker CBR based system achieved water quality prediction accuracy of 97.9% using cosine distance similarity measure.

abstract = {Amyloids are fibrous protein aggregates defined by shared specific structural features. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid in organs leads to amyloidosis, which results in various neurodegenerative diseases. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has proven to be an excellent tool investigating amyloids; it has been extensively utilized to characterize its morphology, assembly process, and mechanical properties. This review summarizes studies which applied AFM to detect the inter- and intramolecular interactions of amyloid fibrils and classified the influencing factors of amyloid's nanomechanics in detail. The characteristics of amyloid fibrils driven by inter- and intramolecular interactions, including various morphologies of amyloid fibrils, self-assembly process, and the aggregating pathway, are described. Successful examples where AFM provided abundant information about inter- and intramolecular interactions of amyloid fibrils in different environments are presented. Direct force measurement of intra- or intermolecular interactions utilizing an AFM-based tool, single-molecular force spectroscopy (SMFS), is introduced. Some mechanical information such as elasticity, adhesiveness, and strength was obtained by stretching amyloid fibrils. This review helps researchers in understanding the mechanism of amyloidogenesis and exploring the properties of amyloid using AFM techniques.},

abstract = {The atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows the measurement of interactions at interfaces with nanoscale resolution. Imperfections in the shape of the tip often lead to the presence of imaging artifacts, such as the blurring and repetition of objects within images. In general, these artifacts can only be avoided by discarding data and replacing the probe. Under certain circumstances (e.g., rare, high-value samples, or extensive chemical/physical tip modification), such an approach is not feasible. Here, we apply a novel deblurring technique, using a Bayesian framework, to yield a reliable estimation of the real surface topography without any prior knowledge of the tip geometry (blind reconstruction). A key contribution is to leverage the significant recently successful body of work in natural image deblurring to solve this problem. We focus specifically on the double-tip effect, where two asperities 1 are present on the tip, each contributing to the image formation mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed technique successfully removes the double-tip effect from high-resolution AFM images, which demonstrate this artifact while preserving feature resolution. 1 An asperity is a localized sharp peak in the surface of an object.},

To explore functions of EMs is an important research field for environmental assessment and treatment. However, EMs are traditionally investigated through morphological analysis using microscopes or DNA analysis, which is time and money consuming. To overcome this, we introduce an innovative method which applies content-based image analysis (CBIA) to environmental microbiology. Our method classifies EMs into different categories based on features extracted from microscopic images. Specifically, it consists of three steps: The first is image segmentation which accurately extracts the region of an EM in a microscopic image with a small amount of user interaction. The second step is feature extraction where multiple features are extracted to describe different characteristics of the EM. In particular, we develop an internal structure histogram descriptor which captures the structure of the EM using angles defined on its contour. The last step is fusion which combines classification results by different features to improve the performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and practicability of our environmental microbiology method aided by CBIA.},

Afterwards, the glomerulus diameter and Bowman's capsule thickness are measured.The proposed system was tested with a dataset of 21 rats' renal corpuscle images acquired using light microscope.The experimental results proven that the proposed solution can detect the renal corpuscle and its objects efficiently with robustness to the deformations of the glomeruli, even in the case of glomerular hypertrophy that leads to split the bowman space.The results also reported significant difference between the controlled and affected groups in terms of glomerulus diameter (97.40 19.02µm and 177.03 54.48µm, respectively). Glomerulus diameter and Bowman's space width in renal microscopic images indicate various diseases. Therefore, the detection of the renal corpuscle and related objects is a key step in histopathological evaluation of renal microscopic images. However, the task of automatic glomeruli detection is challenging due to their wide intensity variation, besides the inconsistency in terms of shape and size of the glomeruli in the renal corpuscle. Here, a novel solution is proposed which includes the Particles Analyzer technique based on median filter for morphological image processing to detect the renal corpuscle objects.

The as-synthesized molecular sieves belong to four different type zeolite families: MFI (infinite and high silica), FAU (moderate silica), LTA (low silica and high alumina), and AFI (alumina rich and silicafree). The phase purity of molecular sieves has been assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and morphological evaluation done by electron microscopy. Broad XRD peaks reveal that each zeolite molecular sieve sample is composed of nanocrystallites. Scanning electron microscopic images feature the notion that the incorporation of aluminum to MFI zeolite synthesis results in morphological change. The crystals of pure silica MFI zeolite (silicalite-1) have hexagon lump/disk-like shape, whereas MFI zeolite particles with Si/Al molar ratios 250 and 100 have distorted hexagonal lump/disk and pseudo spherical shapes, respectively. Furthermore, phase pure zeolite nanocrystals of octahedron (FAU), cubic (LTA), and rod (AFI) shape have been synthesized. The average sizes of MFI, FAU, LTA, and AFI zeolite crystals are 250, 150, 50, and 3000 nm, respectively. Although the length of AFI zeolite rods is in micron scale, the thickness and width are of a few nanometers.},

Characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the printed lines were shown to be characterized by smooth surfaces with a root mean square roughness of 7.986 nm; a significantly higher thickness (12.2 µm) than the skin depth; and a high conductivity of 2 \texttimes{} 107 S/m. These excellent printed line characteristics enabled the implementation of a high-selectivity DBBSF using shunt-connected uniform impedance resonators (UIRs). Additionally, the inductive loading effect of T-shaped stubs on the UIRs, which were analyzed using S-parameters based on lumped parameter calculations, was used to improve the return losses of the geometrically optimized DBBSF. The measured minimum return loss and maximum insertion loss of 28.26 and 1.58 dB, respectively, at the central frequencies of 2.56 and 5.29 GHz of a protocol screen-printed DBBSF demonstrated the excellent performance of the material and its significant potential for use in future cost-effective, flexible WiMax and WLAN applications.},

abstract = {In general terms, sintering describes the bonding of particles into a more coherent structure, where joins form between packed particles, usually as a result of heating. Characterization of sintering is an important topic in the fields of metallurgy, steel, iron ore pellets, ceramics, and snow for understanding material properties and material strength. Characterization using image analysis has been applied in a number of these fields but is either semi-automatic, requiring human interaction in the analysis, or based on statistical sampling and stereology to characterize the sample. This paper presents a novel fully automatic image analysis algorithm to analyze and determine the degree of sintering based on analysis of the particle joins and structure. Quantitative image analysis of the sintering degree is demonstrated for samples of iron ore pellets but could be readily applied to other packed particle materials. Microscope images of polished cross-sections of iron ore pellets have been imaged in their entirety and automated analysis of hundreds of images has been performed. Joins between particles have been identified based on morphological image processing and features have been calculated based on the geometric properties and curvature of these joins.

abstract = {Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, and the pathological examination remains the gold standard for the final diagnosis. Traditionally, the histopathology slides are examined under a microscope by pathologists which typically leads to inter- and intra-observer variations. In addition, it is time consuming and tedious to analyze a whole glass slide manually. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique for automated analysis and diagnosis of the skin whole slide image. The proposed technique consists of five modules: epidermis segmentation, keratinocytes segmentation, melanocytes detection, feature construction and classification. Since the epidermis, keratinocytes and melanocytes are important cues for the pathologists, these regions are first segmented. Based on the segmented regions of interest, the spatial distribution and morphological features are constructed. These features, representing a skin tissue, are classified by a multi-class support vector machine classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is able to provide a satisfactory performance (with about 90% classification accuracy) and is able to assist the pathologist for the skin tissue analysis and diagnosis. HighlightsFully automatic technique for histopathological skin tissue analysis and diagnosis.Automatic segmentation of the regions of interest.Automated analysis of the spatial and morphological features.Objective measures not sensitive to the inter- and intra-image variations.Good performance on 66 skin slides which includes tissues with melanoma.},

abstract = {In the search for a cure for many muscular disorders it is often necessary to analyze muscle fibers under a microscope. For this morphological analysis, we developed an image processing approach to automatically analyze and quantify muscle fiber images so as to replace today's less accurate and time-consuming manual method. Muscular disorders, that include cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophies, and diseases of nerves that affect muscles such as neuropathy and myasthenia gravis, affect a large percentage of the population and, therefore, are an area of active research for new treatments. In research, the morphological features of muscle fibers play an important role as they are often used as biomarkers to evaluate the progress of underlying diseases and the effects of potential treatments. Such analysis involves assessing histopathological changes of muscle fibers as indicators for disease severity and also as a criterion in evaluating whether or not potential treatments work. However, quantifying morphological features is time-consuming, as it is usually performed manually, and error-prone. To replace this standard method, we developed an image processing approach to automatically detect and measure the cross-sections of muscle fibers observed under microscopy that produces faster and more objective results. As such, it is well-suited to processing the large number of muscle fiber images acquired in typical experiments, such as those from studies with pre-clinical models that often create many images. Tests on real images showed that the approach can segment and detect muscle fiber membranes and extract morphological features from highly complex images to generate quantitative results that are readily available for statistical analysis. Display Omitted We developed an image processing pipeline to automatically analyze muscle fibers.The method can quickly quantify muscle fiber images for high-content analysis.Validation showed that the method achieved high objectivity.The method can help researchers make discovery in muscle-related experiments.},

Volume is one of the most important features for the characterization of a tumour on a macroscopic scale. It is often used to assess the effectiveness of care treatments, thus making its correct evaluation a crucial issue for patient care. Similarly, volume is a key feature on a microscopic scale. Multicellular cancer spheroids are 3D tumour models widely employed in pre-clinical studies to test the effects of drugs and radiotherapy treatments. Very few methods have been proposed to estimate the tumour volume arising from a 2D projection of multicellular spheroids, and even fewer have been designed to provide a 3D reconstruction of the tumour shape. In this work, we propose Reconstruction and Visualization from a Single Projection (ReViSP), an automatic method conceived to reconstruct the 3D surface and estimate the volume of single cancer multicellular spheroids, or even of spheroid cultures. As the input parameter ReViSP requires only one 2D projection, which could be a widefield microscope image. We assessed the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with other approaches. To this purpose, we used a new strategy that allowed us to achieve accurate volume measurements based on the analysis of home-made 3D objects, built by mimicking the spheroid morphology. The results confirmed the effectiveness of our method for both 3D reconstruction and volume assessment. ReViSP software is distributed as an open source tool.},

Mechanical stimuli play a significant role in the process of long bone development as evidenced by clinical observations and in vivo studies. Up to now approaches to understand stimuli characteristics have been limited to the first stages of epiphyseal development. Furthermore, growth plate mechanical behavior has not been widely studied. In order to better understand mechanical influences on bone growth, we used Carter and Wong biomechanical approximation to analyze growth plate mechanical behavior, and explore stress patterns for different morphological stages of the growth plate. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first attempt to study stress distribution on growth plate during different possible stages of bone development, from gestation to adolescence. Stress distribution analysis on the epiphysis and growth plate was performed using axisymmetric (3D) finite element analysis in a simplified generic epiphyseal geometry using a linear elastic model as the first approximation. We took into account different growth plate locations, morphologies and widths, as well as different epiphyseal developmental stages. We found stress distribution during bone development established osteogenic index patterns that seem to influence locally epiphyseal structures growth and coincide with growth plate histological arrangement.},

After fourteen ARB cycles, the nanocomposite showed a homogeneous distribution of reinforcements and a significant reduction in average matrix grain size. Meanwhile, the nanocomposite revealed a higher percentage of recrystallization and lower intensity of basal texture as compared to monolithic Mg. Mechanical properties were investigated through tensile and microhardness tests. The strength and elastic modulus and microhardness of Mg/2 wt.%SiCp were found to be improved significantly from eight ARB cycles and reach maximum values at fourteen ARB cycles. The ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, microhardness, and elastic modulus of Mg/2 wt.%SiCp are considerably increased by 17.6%, 61.0%, 72.7%, and 80.8% as compared to raw Mg, respectively.},

abstract = {Greenhouse effect is responsible for keeping average temperature of Earth’s atmosphere at level of about 288 K. Its intensification leads to warming of our planet and may contribute to adverse changes in the environment. The most important pollution intensifying greenhouse effect is anthropogenic carbon dioxide. This particular gas absorbs secondary infrared radiation, which in the end leads to an increase of average temperature of Earth’s atmosphere. Main source of CO2 is burning of fossil fuels, like oil, natural gas, and coal. Therefore, to reduce its emission, a special CO2 capture and storage technology is required. Carbonaceous materials are promising materials for CO2 sorbents. Thus multiwalled carbon nanotubes, due to the lack of impurities like ash in activated carbons, were chosen as a model material for investigation of acid treatment impact on CO2 uptake. Remarkable 43% enhancement of CO2 sorption capacity was achieved at 273 K and relative pressure of 0.95. Samples were also thoroughly characterized in terms of texture (specific surface area measurement, transmission electron microscope) and chemical composition (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy).},

abstract = {Textures and compositions are critical information for interpreting rock formation. Existing methods to integrate both types of information favor high-resolution images of mineral compositions over small areas or low-resolution images of larger areas for phase identification. The method in this paper produces images of individual phases in which textural and compositional details are resolved over three orders of magnitude, from tens of micrometers to tens of millimeters. To construct these images, called Phase Composition Maps (PCMs), we make use of the resolution in backscattered electron (BSE) images and calibrate the gray scale values with mineral analyses by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). The resulting images show the area of a standard thin section (roughly 40mm20mm) with spatial resolution as good as 3.5 m/pixel, or more than 81000 pixels/mm2, comparable to the resolution of X-ray element maps produced by wavelength-dispersive spectrometry (WDS). Procedures to create PCMs for mafic igneous rocks with multivariate linear regression models for minerals with solid solution (olivine, plagioclase feldspar, and pyroxenes) are presented and are applicable to other rock types. PCMs are processed using threshold functions based on the regression models to image specific composition ranges of minerals. PCMs are constructed using widely-available instrumentation: a scanning-electron microscope (SEM) with BSE and EDS X-ray detectors and standard image processing software such as ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop. Three brief applications illustrate the use of PCMs as petrologic tools: to reveal mineral composition patterns at multiple scales; to generate crystal size distributions for intracrystalline compositional zones and compare growth over time; and to image spatial distributions of minerals at different stages of magma crystallization by integrating textures and compositions with thermodynamic modeling. Phase Composition Maps (PCMs) show mineral compositions in rock sections (4020mm).PCMs vs. X-ray maps: higher resolution for larger area in less time for lower cost.Linear regression links BSE gray scale values to mineral solid solution compositions.PCMs integrate mineral composition and rock texture to model rock forming processes.},

We describe how we made a manganese-chromium (Mn-Cr) bimetallic nanocomposite using the centrifuge method and a low-to-high approach. We conducted scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, and X-ray diffraction spectra of the nanocomposite to prove its identity. We examined how centrifuge speed, process time, and the use of an "intruder agent" affected the properties of the material. The fractal dimension is a significant factor that can be used to approximate the surface roughness, the texture segmentation, and an image of the studied compounds. We calculated the technique of fractal dimensions using image-processing values on a computer and histogram plot with the SEM image of the Mn-Cr bimetallic nanocomposite using MATLAB software. We applied the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software for statistics data extracted from the SEM image of the nanocomposite and obtained the following results: mean = 1.778, median = 1.770, max = 1.98, min = 1.60, skewness = 0.177, range = 0.38, and harmonic mean = 1.771 for fractal dimension of the SEM image.},

The morphological, color, and textural traits of the grain body, sterile lemmas, and brush were quantified. An SRC classifier was subsequently developed to identify the varieties of the grains using the traits as the inputs.

Synthesis strategies were based on the oil-in-water microemulsion reaction method. Thermally treated nanomaterials were characterized in terms of structure, morphology, and composition, to confirm hybrid nanoparticles formation and relate with the synthesis approaches; textural, optical, and magnetic properties were evaluated. X-ray diffraction revealed coexistence of cubic spinel-type CoFe2O4 and tetragonal anatase TiO2. Electron microscopy images depicted crystalline nanoparticles (sizes below 25 nm), with homogeneous Ti distribution for the hybrid nanoparticles synthesized by seed approach. EDX microanalysis and ICP-AES corroborated established chemical composition. XPS evidenced chemical states, as well as TiO2 predominance over CoFe2O4 surface. According to BET measurements, the hybrid nanoparticles were mesoporous. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed optical response along the UV-visible light region. Magnetic properties suggested the breaking order of magnetic domains due to modification with TiO2, especially for mediated seed approach sample. The properties of the obtained hybrid nanoparticles were different in comparison with its individual components. The results highlight the usefulness of designed microemulsion approaches for the straightforward synthesis of CoFe2O4-TiO2 nanostructured hybrids.},

abstract = {Coal is a primary natural resource of fuel that is efficiently used for electricity generation, steel or iron production, and household usage. Characterization is needed for industries to understand the quality of coal before shipping. Currently, industries follow chemical, microscopical, and machine-based analysis as the gold standard for coal characterization. These conventional analyses of coal are an indispensable method over the years and have tested by high skilled petrologists. Though, these types of optical or machine-dependent recognition of coal category samples are quite slow, expensive, and restricted by subjective analyses with less accuracy. The main aim of this research is to propose an accurate, time, and cost-effective machine learning-based automated characterization system by analyzing coal color and textural features. This paper comes up with a quantitative approach toward the characterization of dissimilar types of coal for better utilization in industries. The proposed ensemble learning coal characterization method provides an accuracy of around 97% and takes less computational time than conventional methods. Hence, the proposed automated coal characterization system provides support to industries in the development of computer-aided assessment of coal category samples.},

abstract = {Accurate and automated identification of mitosis is essential and challenging to many biomedical applications. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel mitotic cell recognition method by integrating heterogenous data in the framework of cross domain learning. First, we extract the discriminative feature to represent the local structure and textural saliency of individual cell sample. Second, the cell type-dependent classifiers are respectively trained on the target domain and the auxiliary domain and then fused in the framework of adaptive support vector machine for cross-domain learning. The achieved classifier can be implemented for mitotic cell recognition in the cross domain manner. The extensive experiments on two kinds of phase contrast microscopy image sequences (C3H10T1/2&amp; C2C12) show that the proposed method can leverage the datasets from multiple domains to boost the performance by effectively transferring the knowledge from the auxiliary domain to the target domain.

abstract = {This CAD system calculates proliferation rate estimation (PRE) automatically.A novel Iterative Randomized Irregular Circular Algorithm (IRIC) has been proposed.The Brain Tumor Ki-67 Histology Images are taken from UKM Medical Centre.Prior to a random set region of interest, IRIC counts blue and brown cells and PRE.IRIC outperforms Circular Hough Transform about 98% and of F-measurement rate. Proliferation rate estimation (PRE) is clinically performed from Ki-67 histopathology images. As brain tumor tissues are very complex, accurate PRE determination requires manual cell counting that is tedious, time consuming and inherently inaccurate due to inter-personal variations. Therefore, pathologists usually determine the PRE based on their experience and visualization without actual counting. Automating PRE can substantially increase the efficiency and accuracy of pathologists' determination of PRE. In addition, developing a deterministic and reproducible proliferation rate value is crucial to reduce inter-observer variability. In this paper, a PRE Computer Aided Diagnosis (PRECAD) system has been developed to automate the determination of PRE from Ki-67 histopathology microscopic images for brain tumors. The process involves six steps: color space transformation, customized color modification, nuclei segmentation based on K-Means clustering, preprocessing the extracted cells, counting based on an iterative structured circle detection (IRIC) algorithm, and finally, calculating the PRE value. The proposed IRIC algorithm is able to detect irregular and overlapping cells by introducing dynamic initialization to the basic RCD method, dividing the entire image into partitions based on 8-neighbor connected components. We initiated a new selection method for determining a best circle candidate that yields a reduced probability of incorrectly detecting circles, and proposed a new technique for detecting irregular cells via a dynamic number of iterations that guarantees finding all the cells in a selected partition. Using the same innovations mentioned above, our proposed IRIC algorithm can also be used to detect irregular and two or more overlapping cells. The proposed PRECAD system achieved high accuracy, as determined by quantitative analysis of precision, recall and F-measurement test values of 97.8%, 98.3% and 98% for blue cells and 98.7%, 98% and 98.4% for brown cells, respectively. Thus, our proposed PRECAD system is as reliable as a pathologist for estimating the proliferation rate, while also featuring inherent reproducibility.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need for the use of additive manufacturing (AM) to produce improved critical application engineering components. However, the materials manufactured using AM perform well below their traditionally manufactured counterparts, particularly for creep and fatigue. Research has shown that this difference in performance is due to the complex relationships between AM process parameters which affect the material microstructure and consequently the mechanical performance as well. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the impact of different AM build parameters on the mechanical performance of parts. Machine learning (ML) models are able to find hidden relationships in data using iterative statistical analyses and have the potential to develop process–structure–property–performance relationships for manufacturing processes, including AM. The aim of this work is to apply ML techniques to materials testing data in order to understand the effect of AM process parameters on the creep rate of additively built nickel-based superalloy and to predict the creep rate of the material from these process parameters. In this work, the predictive capabilities of ML and its ability to develop process–structure–property relationships are applied to the creep properties of laser powder bed fused alloy 718. The input data for the ML model included the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) build parameters used—build orientation, scan strategy and number of lasers—and geometrical material descriptors which were extracted from optical microscope porosity images using image analysis techniques. The ML model was used to predict the minimum creep rate of the Laser Powder Bed Fused alloy 718 samples, which had been creep tested at 650∘C and 600&nbsp;MPa. The ML model was also used to identify the most relevant material descriptors affecting the minimum creep rate of the material (determined by using an ensemble feature importance framework). The creep rate was accurately predicted with a percentage error of 1.40% in the best case. The most important material descriptors were found to be part density, number of pores, build orientation and scan strategy. These findings show the applicability and potential of using ML to determine and predict the mechanical properties of materials fabricated via different manufacturing processes, and to find process–structure–property relationships in AM. This increases the readiness of AM for use in critical applications.},

abstract = {Various biological processes such as transport of oxygen and nutrients, thrombus formation, vascular angiogenesis and remodeling are related to cellular/subcellular level biological processes, where mesoscopic simulations resolving detailed cell dynamics provide a key to understanding and identifying the cellular basis of disease. However, the intrinsic stochastic effects can play an important role in mesoscopic processes, while the time step allowed in a mesoscopic simulation is restricted by rapid cellular/subcellular dynamic processes. These challenges significantly limit the timescale that can be reached by mesoscopic simulations even with high-performance computing. To break this bottleneck and achieve a biologically meaningful timescale, we propose a multiscale parareal algorithm in which a continuum-based solver supervises a mesoscopic simulation in the time-domain. Using an iterative prediction-correction strategy, the parallel-in-time mesoscopic simulation supervised by its continuum-based counterpart can converge fast. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first verified in a time-dependent flow with a sinusoidal flowrate through a Y-shaped bifurcation channel. The results show that the supervised mesoscopic simulations of both Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian bloods converge to reference solutions after a few iterations. Physical quantities of interest including velocity, wall shear stress and flowrate are computed to compare against those of reference solutions, showing a less than 1% relative error on flowrate in the Newtonian flow and a less than 3% relative error in the non-Newtonian blood flow. The proposed method is then applied to a large-scale mesoscopic simulation of microvessel blood flow in a zebrafish hindbrain for temporal acceleration. The three-dimensional geometry of the vasculature is constructed directly from the images of live zebrafish under a confocal microscope, resulting in a complex vascular network with 95 branches and 57 bifurcations. The time-dependent blood flow from heartbeats in this realistic vascular network of zebrafish hindbrain is simulated using dissipative particle dynamics as the mesoscopic model, which is supervised by a one-dimensional blood flow model (continuum-based model) in multiple temporal sub-domains. The computational analysis shows that the resulting microvessel blood flow converges to the reference solution after only two iterations. The proposed method is suitable for long-time mesoscopic simulations with complex fluids and geometries. It can be readily combined with classical spatial decomposition for further acceleration.},

abstract = {Recent advances in computational and algorithmic power are evolving the field of medical imaging rapidly. In cancer research, many new directions are sought to characterize patients with additional imaging features derived from radiology and pathology images. The emerging field of Computational Pathology targets the high-throughput extraction and analysis of the spatial distribution of cells from digital histopathology images. The associated morphological and architectural features allow researchers to quantify and characterize new imaging biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. However, while the image feature space grows, exploration and analysis become more difficult and ineffective. There is a need for dedicated interfaces for interactive data manipulation and visual analysis of computational pathology and clinical data. For this purpose, we present &lt;italic&gt;IIComPath&lt;/italic&gt;, a visual analytics approach that enables clinical researchers to formulate hypotheses and create computational pathology pipelines involving cohort construction, spatial analysis of image-derived features, and cohort analysis. We demonstrate our approach through use cases that investigate the prognostic value of current diagnostic features and new computational pathology biomarkers.},

abstract = {The analysis of histological images is based on visual assessment of tissues by specialists using an optical microscopy. This task can be time-consuming and challenging, mainly due to the complexity of the structures and diseases under investigation. These facts have motivated the development of computational methods to support specialists in research and decision-making. Despite the different computational strategies available in the literature, the solutions based on genetic algorithm have not been fully explored to provide the best combination of features, selection algorithms and classifiers. In this paper, we describe an approach based on genetic algorithm able to evaluate a significant number of features, selection methods and classifiers in order to provide an acceptable association for the diagnosis and pattern recognition of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and colorectal cancer. The chromosomal structure was represented with four genes. The evaluation and selection of individuals, as well as the crossover and mutation processes, were defined to distinguish the groups under investigation, with the highest AUC value and the smallest number of features. The tests were performed considering 1512 features from histological images, different population sizes and number of iterations. An initial population of 50 individuals and 50 iterations provided the best result (AUC value of 0.984) for the colorectal histological images. For non-Hodgkin lymphoma images, the best result (AUC value of 0.947) was obtained with a population of 500 individuals and 50 iterations. The proposed methodology with detailed information regarding the methods, features and best associations are relevant contributions for the community interested in the study of pattern recognition of colorectal cancer and lymphomas.},

In this study, we investigated algorithms based on multiscale and multidimensional fractal geometry with colour models for classification of lymphoma images. Fractal features were extracted from the colour models and separate channels from these models. These features were concatenated to form feature vectors. Finally, we investigated the Hermite polynomial classifier and machine learning algorithms in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. We employed the tenfold cross-validation method and evaluated the lesion sub-types with the binary and multiclass classifications. The separated colour channels obtained from histological images achieved relevant values for the binary and multiclass classifications, with an accuracy rating between 91 and 97%.

A method of trajectory data extraction, classification, and visualization based on stay points was proposed in this paper to analyze the operation characteristics of heavy trucks from the perspectives of intracity transportation, intraprovincial transportation, and interprovincial transportation. The GPS trajectory data of heavy trucks in Sichuan Province in March 2019 were taken as an example to analyze the operation characteristics. The results show that the heavy trucks in Sichuan Province are mainly transported within the province, and the freight efficiency is slightly better than the average level of the national freight trucks in the same period, failing to give full play to the advantages of long transport distance. The manufacturing industry is the main service object of heavy trucks, and the vehicles engaged in transportation within the province are more dependent on logistics enterprises and their ancillary facilities. The north-south longitudinal line and east-west horizontal line are the main interprovincial transport channels, and the provincial and municipal transport is mainly concentrated in some urban trunk lines, ring lines, and express routes. The proposed technical method can describe the operating characteristics of freight trucks from the perspective of microscopic and service market, not only to guide the layout of highway freight yards, logistics parks, and logistics hubs and the determination of service functions but also to provide a reference basis for freight management-related departments and drivers to formulate transportation plans and establish freight information platforms to improve freight efficiency and safety.},

A novel TbPO4·H2O@silica-NH2 nanocomplex was then formed by functionalizing these nanorods with silica and conjugating with biological agents. The field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction reveal the morphology and structure of the nanorods, with their controllable sizes (500-800 nm in length and 50-80 nm in diameter). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to identify chemical substances or functional groups of the TbPO4·H2O@silica-NH2 nanocomplex. The photoluminescence spectra show the four emission lines of TbPO4·H2O@silica-NH2 in folic acid at 488, 540, 585, and 621 nm under 355 nm laser excitation, which could be attributed to the 5D4-7Fj (J=6,5,4,3) transitions of Tb3+.

Applying zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in sunscreen products (like cloths or textiles) to protect human skin by absorbing the ultraviolet radiations that emerged from the sun. The main aim of this study is to investigate both absorbance and transmittance characteristics of the untreated and treated cotton textiles. For ZnO NPs using hydrothermal methods, they were made from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and NaOH at a constant annealing temperature of 300°C. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-vis spectroscopy were used to analyze the produced ZnO NPs. From the FT-IR result, ZnO NPs were observed in the region of 400-600 cm-1. Wurtzite hexagonal structure of ZnO NPs with the average crystal size 32±49 nm was observed from XRD results. Flowers in the shape of synthesized ZnO NPs were observed from SEM images. The UV-vis penetration peaks were identified at 264 nm and 376 nm, with energy band gaps of 4.68 and 3.536 eV, respectively. When compared to bulk ZnO, the energy band gap of ZnO NPs was blue-shifted due to the impact of quantum confinement. The peaks in UV-vis absorption were caused by an electronic transition from the valiancy to the conduction bands. The high energy band shows high absorbance of the synthesis sample in the case of 264 nm. The ZnO NPs were manufactured and applied to 100% of raw cotton to impart sunscreen action to both untreated and treated cotton fabrics. The performance of treatment has been evaluated utilizing UV-vis spectroscopy through quantifying ultraviolet protective factors (UPF) and percentage of transmitted (%T) radiations. The treated cotton textiles have 61.50% UPF while 2.65% ultraviolet radiations were transmitted. In other words, untreated cotton textiles have 1.63% UPF while 74.56% ultraviolet radiation was transmitted. Therefore, the treated cotton textiles have excellent protection categories when compared to untreated cotton textiles.},

The XRD peaks 15.2, 20.1, 21.6, 26.1, 30.9, 32.2, 33.1, 34.2, 41.0, 41.8, 45.3, 47.2, 48.6, 51.1, 51.9, 55.4, and 58.8 can be assigned to the plane of vanadium crystals and indicate that the V2O5NPs were face-centered, cubic, and crystalline in nature. The FTIR results showed the presence of some biomolecules in fungal cell-free filtrate that act as a bioreducing and capping agent for V2O5NP mycosynthesis. DLS showed that the size of V2O5NPs was 10-20 nm. Zeta potential showed −35.09 mV for V2O5NPs with a single peak. Study of antifungal activity of V2O5NPs against various pathogenic fungi in concentrations of 5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL showed that V2O5NPs strongly inhibited both mycelium growth (20.3 to 67.3%) and spore germination (64.8 to 89.9%) dose-dependently. V2O5NPs showed strong cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell-line MCF-7 with an IC50 value of 55.89 μg/mL. Microscopy images showed morphological changes and reduction of cancer cell populations in V2O5NP-treated MCF-7 cell-line. Taken together, our results demonstrated that bioactive V2O5NPs successfully synthesized by F. oxysporum could be considered a potential candidate in drug development against life-threatening fungal pathogens and as a feasible anticancer agent.},

abstract = {Autologous transplantation of cryopreserved fragments of an immature testis is an actively developing approach to save fertility in patients facing a gonadotoxic therapy. The use of bioavailable fullerene C60 as a powerful antioxidant opens up a new potential for the prevention and correction of ischemic-reperfusion pathological processes in tissues including those associated with freezing-thawing procedure. In this work, we aimed to study the antioxidant status, apoptotic/necrotic processes, and morphological characteristics of cryopreserved fragments of the seminiferous tubules of testis (CrFSTT) of immature rats after incubation in media with different concentrations of fullerene C60 (10, 15, and 20 μg/mL). Our results indicated that the addition of C60 in a concentration of 15 μg/mL decreased ROS production, cytochrom C release, and degree of histological damage of spermatogenic epithelium as well as increased the activity of the mitochondria, antioxidant defense system, and cell density in histological sections of CrFSTT compared to the control. Fullerene C60 at investigated concentrations did not impact significantly on apoptosis in cells of CrFSTT but, after incubation with 15 μg/mL C60, a percentage of living cells was 1.2-fold higher and a value of necrotic ones in this group was 1.6-fold lower than the control samples (p&lt;0.05). Relative amount of cells of the spermatogonia germ layer did not differ between the studied concentrations. The general analysis of obtained data showed that the C60 addition in the concentration of 15 μg/mL was the most optimal for the rehabilitation of CrFSTT. The results can be used for the development of an effective rehabilitation medium for the cryopreserved testicular tissue.},

abstract = {Backgroud. To evaluate improvement of arsenic trioxide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (As2O3-PLGA-NPs) to Human Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (HUVSMCs) in vitro. Methods. As2O3-PLGA-NPs were synthesized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and the cumulative release rates of As2O3-PLGA-NPs were measured in vitro; HUVSMCs were treated with As2O3-PLGA-NPs in vitro. MTT assay and flow cytometry assay (FCM) were performed to examine the inhibitory effect of As2O3-PLGA-NPs on HUVSMCs and compared with As2O3 solution at various concentrations. Optical microscope was used to observe the morphological change of HUVSMCs treated with As2O3-PLGA-NPs. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and MMP-9 in HUVSMCs was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot (WB). Results. EDS confirmed that prepared nanoparticles contained elements of arsenic. The surface coating of the eluting stent of As2O3-PLGA-NPs has the same characteristics with our self-prepared As2O3-PLGA-NPs, and it also has a drug sustained-release character. Compared with the control group, cell proliferation and migration cell were significantly suppressed with concentration-dependent (P&lt;0.05, respectively). Meanwhile, in concentration-dependent, As2O3-PLGA-NPs depressed mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2 and MMP-9 and increased mRNA and protein expression of Bax. Conclusion. As2O3-PLGA-NPs had an inhibitory effect on HUVSMCs’ proliferation and migration, and it may work via regulating Bax, Bcl-2, and MMP-9 expression in vitro.},

Extensive exfoliation was observed by transmission electron microscopy with abundant multi and some monolayer GNPs. X-ray diffractometry confirmed 43 GNP layers along the c-axis. Rietveld X-ray analysis indicated a GNP crystal lattice with stacks of parallel two-dimensional graphene layers and tightly bound hybridized carbon atoms stacked in a translational …ABAB… sequence in hexagonal rings.

abstract = {Medicinal plants are composed of a rich pool of biomolecules and have been increasingly recognized for their antimicrobial properties; however, increasing concerns have been put on the bioavailability features. Thus, this study is aimed at exploring the synthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles synthesized by Chenopodium album L. leaf extract and assessing the antifungal activity against Aspergillus terreus Thom. Plant extract was prepared in methanol to synthetize silver nanoparticles, which were then characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV-Visible spectroscopy, and particle size analysis. UV-Visible analysis indicated maximum absorption at 378 nm, and an average particle size was observed as 25.6 nm. Oval to hexagonal shape was observed by SEM. Antifungal activity of silver nanoparticles (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5%) was addressed against A. terreus biomass. At 3.5%, silver nanoparticles revealed to be highly effective, leading to 92% retardation in fungus growth. In next phase, various organic fractions, viz., chloroform, n-butanol, n-hexane, and ethyl acetate, were obtained from plant methanol extract, and the corresponding silver nanoparticles were prepared. These fractions were also assessed for antifungal activity, and n-hexane fraction led to 64% inhibition in A. terreus biomass. Following gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), 18 compounds were identified, namely, 1,3-cyclopentadiene-5-(1 methylethylidene and o-xylene), ethyl benzene, octadecane, nonane, decane, 2-methylheptane, n-hexadecane, 2-methylheptane, and eicosane, along with carbonyl compounds (4,4-dimethyl-3-hexanone) and phenols, like stearic acid, propionic acid hydrazide, and 2,4-di-T-butylphenol. These findings proved that C. album silver nanoparticles are highly effective against A. terreus.},

abstract = {The properties of force-sensing micro-cantilevers are of fundamental importance for measurements employing atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. Due to the well-known arguments of Sader, it is generally accepted that V-shaped cantilevers are more sensitive to lateral forces than rectangular ones. We present results of numerical (finite element modelling) and experimental comparison between torsional spring constants of rectangular and V-shaped commercial AFM cantilevers. As representative example of such beams, we considered AFM probes available commercially. In particular, we tested scaled-up models of V-shaped cantilevers which had the same geometrical shapes as commercial AFM cantilevers. Both the rectangular and the V-shaped larger scale models were made of the same material; they had the same length, thickness, normal spring constant, as well as the same location and shape of the tip base. In the experiments and the simulations, an external lateral load was applied to the free end of the tip. A good agreement between the experimental work and finite element method (FEM) simulations was observed. The results show that the torsional spring constant of the V-shape cantilevers considered here was greater than that of the equivalent rectangular beams by up to 45%. The discrepancy with the results from Sader should be caused by differences in both the load transfer scheme and the geometrical shapes of the V-shaped beams.},

Proper recognition of the species and genera of bacteria is a key stage in the microbiological diagnostics process, because it allows a quick start of the appropriate therapy. The original method proposed in the paper concerns the automatic recognition of selected species and genera of bacteria presented in digital images. The classification was made on the basis of the analysis of the physical characteristics of bacterial cells using the product of classifier confidence weights. The end result of the classification process is the classification list, sorted in descending order according to the weights of the classifiers. In addition to the correct classification, a list of other possible results of the analysis is obtained. The method thus allows not only the classification, but also an analysis of the confidence level of the selection made. The proposed method can be used to recognize not only bacterial cells, but also other microorganisms, for example, fungi that exhibit similar morphological characteristics. In addition, the use of the method does not require the application of specialized computer equipment, which widens the scope of applications regardless of the laboratory IT infrastructure, not only in microbiological diagnostics, but also in other diagnostic laboratories.},

The methodology has three distinctive features. First, a link‐based VMS information utility model is developed. Second, two link‐specific dynamic escape speed models (DESMs), characterized by VMS information, evacuee attributes, and hazard‐related information, are proposed. Third, VMS information characteristics and the intuitionistic fuzzy method are integrated into route choice behavior models. The link‐specific DESMs are used to adjust the reactive DYNASTOCH algorithm to simulate emergency traffic evacuation. Results demonstrate that the proposed models are effective in characterizing not only dynamic evacuation route switching behavior (microscopic) but also network‐wide evacuation traffic performances (macro) under behavioral and information uncertainties.},

Estimating the similarity between merge trees is an important problem with applications to feature-directed visualization of time-varying data. We present an approach based on tree edit distance to compare merge trees. The comparison measure satisfies metric properties, it can be computed efficiently, and the cost model for the edit operations is both intuitive and captures well-known properties of merge trees. Experimental results on time-varying scalar fields, 3D cryo electron microscopy data, shape data, and various synthetic datasets show the utility of the edit distance towards a feature-driven analysis of scalar fields.},

abstract = {The efficiency of any electric cell or battery is very important. To keep it in mind it has been studied the columbic efficiency, voltaic efficiency and energy efficiency of a PKL (Pathor Kuchi Leaf) Quasi Voltaic Cell or Modified Voltaic Cell. It was found that the columbic efficiency data illustrated that this efficiency was lower comparing to other efficiencies may be the absence of salt bridge or separator between the electrodes. Because, our designed and fabricated PKL cell does not have any salt bridge. So that the internal resistance is lower than the traditional voltaic cell and as a result more current was found. The voltage and current changes with time and I–V characteristics for PKL unit cell, module, panel and array have also been studied. It is shown that the voltaic and energy efficiency have been studied. However, the highest efficiency was obtained for 40% PKL sap with 5% secondary salt in 55% aqueous solution, which implies that the concentration of PKL juice can play an important role regarding efficiency. It was also found that the average energy efficiency was 97.43% and it was also found that the average voltaic efficiency was 57.29%. Finally, morphological study FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy) has also been performed. It is seen that the results confirmed that Zn was deposited on the Cu surface during the electro deposition process in PKL solution. Using AAS, it has been measured the concentration of [Cu2+] as a reactant ion and the concentration of [Zn2+] as a product ion those have been tabulated and graphically discussed. The variation of pH has also been studied with time and which was also tabulated and graphically discussed.},

abstract = {TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have the potential to be used in the human body as an artificial implant because of their special physicochemical properties. However, information about the effects of TiO2 NPs on preosteoblast proliferation and osteogenic differentiation is not clear. In this work, we focus on the impact of TiO2 NPs with different shapes and sizes on the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. The morphology and physicochemical properties of TiO2 NPs are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Quadrasorb SI analyzer, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential. The MTT results indicate that when the concentration of TiO2 NPs is less than 20 μg/mL, the proliferation of osteoblasts is preserved the most. The expression of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin is detected by BCA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to analyze the differentiation of osteoblasts. The results indicate that both rutile and anatase TiO2 NPs have a significant inhibiting influence on the differentiation of osteoblasts. Alizarin Red staining is performed on cells to detect the mineralized nodules. The results show that TiO2 NPs can promote the mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. Then, we study the oxidative stress response of MC3T3-E1 cells by flow cytometry analysis, and all TiO2 NPs induce the excessive generation of reactive oxide species. On the other hand, our study also shows that the early apoptotic cells increase significantly. TiO2 NPs are swallowed by cells, and then the agglomerated particles enter mitochondria, causing the shape of mitochondria to change and vacuolation to appear. All these results show that TiO2 NPs have certain cytotoxicity to cells, but they also promote the mineralization and maturation of osteoblasts.},

abstract = {Improving on the very high temperatures used in solid-state synthesis routes to prepare CCTO ignited the idea of using oxalate routes which make use of organic solvents in the synthesis of CCTOX as oxalate intermediates to the decomposition product, CCTO. The use of commercial oxalic acids and oxalate has not only recorded a solubility problem which reflects on the size, shape, homogeneity, and morphology of the final product but also has an environmental impact originating from the solvents used. Both the composition and morphology of these inhomogeneities play a role in the behaviour of the final product, pointing out the need to assess the dependence of size, shape, homogeneity, and morphology and the material performance on the sample synthesis history. In this study, nanosized particles of calcium copper titanium oxide, CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO), were successfully synthesized by pyrolysis of the corresponding heterometal oxalate precursors obtained via coprecipitation using the edible carambola fruit juice as a precipitating agent and investigated in detail. The precursors were characterized, and the results revealed the formation of a single molecular precursor represented by the formula CaCu3(TiO)4(C2O4)8·9H2O (CCTOX). The decomposition products, obtained via calcination in air, were subsequently subjected to thermal treatments at different temperatures for 4 hours. The morphology and microstructure were characterized, and analysis showed the formation of a single phase, CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) with CuO and CaTiO3 as impurity. It was observed from microscopy that the samples obtained from sintering at 600°C for four hours had discrete particles with regular morphology, limited size distribution, high degree of homogeneity, and multiple dimensions ranging between 10 and 35 nm and showed some degree of ellipticity in shape. Increasing the sintering temperature from 600°C to 700°C and 800°C increased the grain growth in the ceramic as well as the densification. The method makes advantage of the fact that oxalate precursors decomposed at relatively lower temperatures and the fact that the oxalate in the juice is in the solution which downplays both the solubility and environmental pollution problems since no additional solvents are used.},

The average values of the electrical resistance of fabricated samples were evaluated by current-voltage characteristics acquired at room temperature, in the ranges of 0 V–0.2 V, and an increase was noticed with about 50% after the Ar/N2 postsynthesis plasma treatment compared to pristine samples. Moreover, the Hall measurements proved that the obtained CNW structures had p-type conductivity (Hall coefficient was 0.206 m3/C), and the concentration of charge carriers was 7.8\texttimes{}1019 cm-3, at room temperature.},

abstract = {According to the randomness of the spatial distribution and shape of the internal cells of closed-cell foam aluminum and based on the Voronoi algorithm, we use ABAQUS to model the random polyhedrons of pore cells firstly. Then, the algorithm of generating aluminum foam with random pore size and random wall thickness is written by Python and Fortran, and the mesh model of random polyhedral particles and random wall thickness was established by the algorithm read in by TrueGrid software. Finally, the mesh model is impo rted into the LS-DYNA software to remove the random polyhedron part of the pore cell. Compared with the results of scanning electron microscopy and antiknock test, the morphology and properties of the model are close to those of the real aluminum foam material, and the coincidence degree is more than 91.4%. By means of numerical simulation, the mechanism of the wall deformation, destruction of closed-cell aluminum foams, and the rapid attenuation of explosion stress wave after the interference of reflection and transmission of bubbles were studied and revealed. It is found that aluminum foam deformation can be divided into four areas: collapse area, fracture area, plastic deformation area, and elastic deformation region. Therefore, the explosion resistance is directly related to the cell wall thickness and bubble size, and there is an optimal porosity rule for aluminum foam antiknock performance.},

Thermal analysis data show that TATB coating enhances the thermal stability of CL-20/VitonA. The impact and friction sensitivity results show that superior mechanical properties of these composite microspheres could be maintained.

abstract = {Histological assessment of glands is one of the major concerns in colon cancer grading. Considering that poorly differentiated colorectal glands cannot be accurately segmented, we propose an approach for segmentation of glands in colon cancer images, based on the characteristics of lumens and rough gland boundaries. First, we use a U-net for stain separation to obtain H-stain, E-stain, and background stain intensity maps. Subsequently, epithelial nucleus is identified on the histopathology images, and the lumen segmentation is performed on the background intensity map. Then, we use the axis of least inertia-based similar triangles as the spatial characteristics of lumens and epithelial nucleus, and a triangle membership is used to select glandular contour candidates from epithelial nucleus. By connecting lumens and epithelial nucleus, more accurate gland segmentation is performed based on the rough gland boundary. The proposed stain separation approach is unsupervised, and the stain separation makes the category information contained in the H&amp;E image easy to identify and deal with the uneven stain intensity and the inconspicuous stain difference. In this project, we use deep learning to achieve stain separation by predicting the stain coefficient. Under the deep learning framework, we design a stain coefficient interval model to improve the stain generalization performance. Another innovation is that we propose the combination of the internal lumen contour of adenoma and the outer contour of epithelial cells to obtain a precise gland contour. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm against that of several state-of-the-art technologies on publicly available datasets. The results show that the segmentation approach combining the characteristics of lumens and rough gland boundary has better segmentation accuracy.},

abstract = {In mechanics, one often describes microscopic processes such as those leading to friction between relative interfaces using macroscopic variables (relative velocity, temperature, etc.) in order to avoid
models of intangible complexity. As a consequence, such macroscopic models are frequently nonsmooth, a prominent example being the Coulomb law of friction. In many cases, these models are perfectly adequate
for engineering purposes. Formally, however, since the Fundamental Theorem of Existence and Uniqueness does not apply to these situations, one  generally expects that these models possess forward nonuniqueness of
solutions. Consequently, numerical computations of such systems might possibly unknowingly discard certain solutions. In this paper, we try to shed further light on this issue by studying solutions of a simple friction oscillator subject to stiction friction. The stiction law is a simple nonsmooth model of friction that is a modification of Coulomb based on the fundamental observation that the dynamic friction force, when the mass is in motion, is smaller than the static friction force during stick. The resulting piecewise smooth vector field of
this discontinuous model does not follow the classical Filippov convention, and the concept of a
Filippov solution cannot be used. Furthermore, some Carath\'{e}odory solutions, i.e., absolutely continuous solutions satisfying the differential equation in a weaker sense,  are nonphysical.
Therefore, we introduce the  concept of stiction solutions. These are the Carath\'{e}odory
solutions that are physically relevant, i.e., the ones that follow the stiction law.  However,
we find that some of the stiction solutions are forward nonunique in subregions of the slip
onset. We call these solutions singular, in contrast to the regular stiction solutions that
are forward unique. In order to further  understanding of the nonunique dynamics, we then
introduce a general regularization of the model. This gives a singularly perturbed problem that
captures the main features of the original discontinuous problem. Using geometric singular perturbation theory, we identify a repelling
slow manifold that separates the forward slipping from the forward sticking solutions, leading to
high sensitivity to the initial conditions. On this slow manifold we find canard trajectories
that have the physical interpretation of delaying the slip onset. Most interestingly, we find that these new solutions do not correspond to stiction solutions in the piecewise-smooth limit,
and are therefore seemingly nonphysical,  yet they are robust and appear generically in the class of regularizations we consider.
Finally, we show that
the regularized problem has a family of periodic orbits interacting with the canards. We observe
that this family has a saddle stability and that it connects, in the rigid body limit, the two
regular, slip-stick branches of the discontinuous problem, which are otherwise disconnected.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been an increasing interest in sensing devices that capture multidimensional information such as the spectral light field (SLF) images, which are 5-dimensional (5D) representations of a scene including 2D spatial, 2D angular and 1D spectral information. Spatio-spectral and angular information plays an important role in modern applications spanning from microscopy to computer vision. However, SLF sensors use expensive beam-splitters or cameras arrays placed in tandem, which split the sensing problem in two time consuming and independent tasks: spectral and light field imaging tasks. This work proposes a compressive spectral light field imaging architecture that builds on the principles of the compressive imaging framework, to capture multiplexed representations of the multidimensional information, so that, less measurements are required to capture the SLF data cube. Alongside, we propose a computational algorithm to recover the 5D information from the compressed measurements, exploiting the inherent high correlations within the SLF by treating them as 3D tensors. Furthermore, exploiting the geometry properties of the proposed optical architecture, the Tucker decomposition is applied to the set of compressed measurements, so that, an ad-hoc dictionary-like image representation basis is calculated online. This in turn, entails a more accurate reconstruction of the SLF since the dictionary fits the specific characteristics of the image itself. We demonstrate through simulations over three SLF datasets captured in our laboratory, and an experimental proof-of-concept implementation, that the proposed compressive imaging device together with the proposed computational algorithm represent an efficient alternative to capture SLF, compared to conventional methods that employ either side-information or multiple sensors. Also, we show that the tensor-based proposed algorithm exhibits a lower computational complexity than the matrix-based state of the art counterparts, thus enabling fast processing of multidimensional images.},

abstract = {Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results from repetitive impacts to the head. Its distinguishing feature is an accumulation of abnormal tau proteins in characteristic regions within the brain. Histopathological studies reveal that tau consistently localizes at the depth of cerebral sulci; yet, the mechanistic origin of this pattern remains unclear. Here we show that a continuum damage model, enhanced with nonlocal gradients, can explain the initial distribution of abnormal tau proteins. We hypothesize that tau aggregation is associated with neuronal death, which we represent as tissue softening and stiffness degradation. Our simulations correctly identify the initial locations of tau deposition, at the depth of cerebral sulci, from where damage spreads within the cortical layer and then across the entire brain. Our computational model has the potential to provide a mechanistic explanation of the stereotypic histopathology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and predict the cumulative effects of repeated mild traumatic brain injuries.},

For the same, an automatic histopathological image classification system can be useful. Moreover, such classification system may also be used to identify the inflamed and healthy tissues from tissue image datasets. However, complex background structures and heterogeneity among histopathological tissue images make it a complicated process. Therefore, this paper introduces an innovative method for categorization of histopathological images using an enhanced bag-of-feature framework. To obtain the optimal visual words in bag-of-features, a new spiral biogeography-based optimization algorithm has been proposed which introduces a spiral search and random search in the mutation operator to generate the suitability index variables. The efficacy of the spiral biogeography-based optimization algorithm has been tested on CEC 2017 benchmarks problems. Moreover, the applicability of the proposed classification method has been observed on two histopathological image datasets, Blue Histology image dataset and ADL Histopathological image dataset. The efficacy of the spiral biogeography-based optimization algorithm based bag-of-features method has been analyzed and compared with other state-of-the-art methods with respect to average accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-measure parameters.},

The relative merits of each technique have been investigated experimentally in the context of CMUT fabrication for better characterization and process development. The surface roughness and diaphragm deformation results have also been compared with AFM data.

abstract = {A neuron’s firing correlates are defined as the features of the external world to which its activity is correlated. In many parts of the brain, neurons have quite simple such firing correlates. A striking example are grid cells in the rodent medial entorhinal cortex: their activity correlates with the animal’s position in space, defining ‘grid fields’ arranged with a remarkable periodicity. Here, we show that the organization and evolution of grid fields relate very simply to physical space. To do so, we use an effective model and consider grid fields as point objects (particles) moving around in space under the influence of forces. We reproduce several observations on the geometry of grid patterns. This particle-like behavior is particularly salient in a recent experiment in which two separate grid patterns merge. We discuss pattern formation in the light of known results from physics of two-dimensional colloidal systems. Notably, we study the limitations of the widely used ‘gridness score’ and show how physics of 2d systems could be a source of inspiration, both for data analysis and computational modeling. Finally, we draw the relationship between our ‘macroscopic’ model for grid fields and existing ‘microscopic’ models of grid cell activity and discuss how a description at the level of grid fields allows to put constraints on the underlying grid cell network.},

abstract = {There have been important developments in microscopy hardware in the last decades and the number of hospitals to deploy such tools has increased, naturally leading to a very high number of microscopic images that need to be processed. The interest in automated image analysis has accordingly grown and calls for a close collaboration between physicians and computer scientists. A first step in analyzing histopathological images with highly irregularly shaped areas of interest, for instance, is represented by image segmentation, i.e., the accurate selection of the glands or nuclei. In the current study, manual segmentation is applied to several histopathological images and the resulting files are next used for measuring how close automatic contour detection methods can get to the annotations of the specialist. More, it is subsequently investigated whether annotations on a small part of the initial file can help in automatically marking the entire image, and how small such a section can be in order to achieve reasonable results. The histogram resemblance between the cropped image and the complete one appears to have an important impact over the results.},

abstract = {Microorganisms such as protozoa and bacteria play very important roles in many practical domains, like agriculture, industry and medicine. To explore functions of different categories of microorganisms is a fundamental work in biological studies, which can assist biologists and related scientists to get to know more properties, habits and characteristics of these tiny but obbligato living beings. However, taxonomy of microorganisms (microorganism classification) is traditionally investigated through morphological, chemical or physical analysis, which is time and money consuming. In order to overcome this, since the 1970s innovative content-based microscopic image analysis (CBMIA) approaches are introduced to microbiological fields. CBMIA methods classify microorganisms into different categories using multiple artificial intelligence approaches, such as machine vision, pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, because CBMIA approaches are semi- or full-automatic computer-based methods, they are very efficient and labour cost saving, supporting a technical feasibility for microorganism classification in our current big data age. In this article, we review the development history of microorganism classification using CBMIA approaches with two crossed pipelines. In the first pipeline, all related works are grouped by their corresponding microorganism application domains. By this pipeline, it is easy for microbiologists to have an insight into each special application domain and find their interested applied CBMIA techniques. In the second pipeline, the related works in each application domain are reviewed by time periods. Using this pipeline, computer scientists can see the dynamic of technological development clearly and keep up with the future development trend in this interdisciplinary field. In addition, the frequently-used CBMIA methods are further analysed to find technological common points and potential reasons.},

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of color-correction methods in the quantitative analysis of histopathological images acquired by different whole-slide scanners (WSSs) has not been confirmed. In this work, several liver tissue samples were scanned by different WSSs, and a color-correction method for whole-slide images was applied to the digitized tissue specimens. A set of histological features were extracted from the histopathological images, both without and with color correction, to analyze the effectiveness of the color-correction method in feature quantification and cancer identification.},

abstract = {The chemical interaction between biogenic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and several metal (II) ions can be regarded as a practical, twofold, colorimetric, and plasmon resonance sensing method for the recognition of some divalent metal ions in aqueous solutions. The green synthesized AuNPs, using Camellia sinensis as a reducing agent, were characterized by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-Vis spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The AuNP colloidal solutions obtained have a pink-reddish color with SPRs centered between 529 and 536 nm. AuNPs with spherical, triangular, and hexagonal shapes were found by TEM analyses. Despite their divergent morphologies, these AuNPs can be employed as colorimetric and plasmon resonance sensors for detection of Ca2+, Sr2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, primarily, in aqueous solutions. Sensibility studies based on molar concentrations were also performed for these metal ions. Furthermore, solid biogenic AuNPs/cellulosic biocomposites were prepared with the aim of developing portable, fast, and dependable colorimetric sensors; nevertheless, these biocomposites resulted to be good adsorbent materials of metal ions.},

Considering encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading as the main evaluation indexes, DG-PLA-NPs were prepared using the modified emulsion solvent diffusion method and single factor and orthogonal design tests were performed to investigate the influencing factors and optimise the preparation method. Morphology of the nanoparticles was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), average particle diameter and distribution were determined using dynamic laser particle size analysis, and the EE and drug loading were measured using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Among the eight factors, the drug-to-material ratio, water-to-organic phase ratio, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) concentration significantly affected the NP EE. In the optimised formulation, the PLA/DG ratio, PVA concentration, and oil-to-water phase ratio were 5, 0.5%, and 5, respectively. The DG-PLA-NPs prepared with the optimised formulation were round or spherical with an average diameter of 209 nm, 79.60% EE, and 6.81% drug loading capacity. The polydispersity index was 0.181, and the zeta potential was −27.37 mV. The in vitro releases of both DG and DG-PLA-NPs conformed to the Weibull equation. The DG-PLA-NPs released desogestrel rapidly in the early stages but slowly at later stages, indicating that compared to DG, the DG-PLA-NPs had obvious sustained-release effects. The DG-PLA-NPs prepared by the modified emulsion solvent diffusion method were small, simple to prepare, and had high drug loading with promising application prospects.},

abstract = {To clarify nanoparticle-protein interaction and their action characteristics, the interactions between MTO-CHP NPs and human serum albumin (HSA) were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). Hydrophobically modified pullulan (CHP) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with mitoxantrone (MTO) were prepared (MTO-CHP NPs) with size 166.9 nm. The spherical shape was verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ITC results demonstrated an interaction between MTO-CHP NPs mainly by hydrophobic interaction force, electrostatic force, and hydrogen bonding. The mean binding constant KA was 0.832\texttimes{}104 M−1 and mean HSA coverage 0.939±0.302. MTO-CHP NPs could quench the fluorescence intensity of HSA, which gradually decreased to be balanced in 9 h and indicated the completion of the complexation. The size and zeta potential changes of the combined particle were dynamically detected with DLS at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 h. When the reaction was completed at 9 h, the particle size and potential remained stable, accompanied by a size change from 89.91 to about 145 nm and potential change from -15 to -3 mV, respectively. The results of CD measurement showed that the change in ellipticity of HSA at 208 nm was similar to the fluorescence spectra and DLS measurements with MTO-CHP NPs combined with HSA. At the beginning of the reaction, the proportion of α-helix was 52.3% to 43.7%, which decreased by 39.1% at compound stabilization. The release of MTO from MTO-CHP NPs at pH=5.6 was significantly accelerated, whereas that of MTO from HSA-MTO-CHP NPs was significantly reduced, and the drug release was significantly slowed down even under acidic conditions, which indicates the beneficial effect of HSA on the persistence and stability of the HSA-MTO-CHP NP compound.},

The morphology tuning was controlled by the temperature of the reaction; the nanoparticles were synthesized via the hydrothermal method at 120°C, 140°C, and 160°C, respectively. The Rm and XRD spectra showed that all the nanoparticles were Fe3O4 in a pure magnetite phase. The obtained nanoparticles exhibited a high level of crystallinity with uniform morphology at each temperature, as can be observed through TEM and SEM. These magnetic nanoparticles exhibited good saturation magnetization and the resulting shapes were quasi-spheres, octahedrons, and cubes. The samples showed striking magnetic properties, which were examined by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). It has been possible to obtain a good morphological control of nanostructured magnetite in a simple, economical, and scalable method by adjusting the temperature, without the modification of any other synthesis parameter.},

Increasing the bioavailability of a drug and prolonging the effect of the drug are important. Tinidazole is an antifungal agent that has absorption interfered by food. This study reported the ability of Leuconostoc mesenteroides VTCC B-871 in producing nanosized minicells used as drug delivery for tinidazole to improve the passage to the eaten mouse intestinal membrane. By using a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope, the morphology of the minicell loading drug was observed. The spherical shape and size (400 nm) of minicells did not change over time when kept in buffered saline gelatin and packaged with tinidazole. Based on Box-Behnken design, the optimal conditions were selected for actual encapsulation. Minicells could encapsulate tinidazole approximately to 90% which was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The maximal concentration of tinidazole released from minicells was 70% at pH 3.4 and 55% at pH 7.2, respectively. The absorption ability of tinidazole packaging minicells was quantified in mice. Tinidazole loading minicells could be absorbed faster than tinidazole alone in fed mice via oral administration. The study assessed that the absorption of water-insoluble tinidazole could be improved by Leuconostoc minicells without inhibition by food effects.},

We compared the doping efficiency of incorporating cobalt in ZnO nanostructured samples doped with cobalt via cobalt nitrate and cobalt chloride. The concentration of cobalt incorporated into the ZnO matrix was precisely determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that only at a 0.1 M ratio of the precursor solutions in CBD using cobalt nitrate as a dopant, the morphology of ZnO yielded hexagonally shaped nanorods. At a 1 M ratio of the precursor solutions, SEM images showed that the morphology of ZnO was nanoplatelets at all doping levels, irrespective of the doping method used. The synthesized nanostructures retained the wurtzite hexagonal structure only at 0.1 M precursor solution using cobalt nitrate doping, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. In cobalt-doped samples using cobalt chloride as a dopant, XRD analysis confirmed the formation of a Simonkolleite structure. At 300°C, the Simonkolleite structure was converted to a wurtzite structure without changing the morphology. Electrical conductivity measurements at 300 K showed that ZnO nanorods doped with cobalt using cobalt nitrate yielded the lowest resistivity. The molarity of the precursor solution and dopant was found to have a substantial impact on the morphology and doping efficiency of the ZnO nanostructures.},

In addition, the surface morphology of the prepared nanoparticles was inspected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which revealed well-dispersed nanoparticles of Fe3O4 into alginate. The adsorption characteristics of the synthesized nanoparticles for removing Ni+2 and Co+2 from wastewater were evaluated via atomic absorption measurements (AAS). The elimination efficiency of the M-AlgNPs was detected at pH=7 in 100 ppm (initial concentration) of Ni+2 and Co+2, separately. The M-AlgNPs provided the maximum equilibrium uptake percentage for Ni+2 and Co+2 of 97.88 and 95.01%, respectively. The adsorption of Ni+2 and Co+2 onto the M-AlgNP surface was found to fit the Langmuir model with R2 values higher than that obtained from the Freundlich model for both metal ions. Moreover, RL “separating factor” for the adsorption process was assessed and found to be less than unity; this expresses the higher ability of the investigated metal ions to be adsorbed onto the M-AlgNP surface. The adsorption method was discovered to be pH-dependent and well-suited to the isothermal equations of Langmuir and Freundlich. For regeneration studies, M-AlgNPs have been investigated and results confirmed that it could be reused with effective sorption capacity over three cycles.},

ERGO powders were obtained by a two-way route, Hummer’s method, and one-step potential (−2 V) followed by annealing process at 400°C (TERGO powders): different quantities of TERGO fine particles (10, 20, and 30 wt%) were added to the in situ PANI polymerization in order to produce the hybrid composites. The morphology and structure of the PANI/TERGO compounds were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal treatment of ERGO powders pointed out high-defect surfaces with a wrinkle-type morphology (ID/IG ratio~0.90). The emeraldine phase of PANI was obtained with a maximum value of 61%, which decreases with the amount of TERGO powders. It is also seen that composites displayed a combined morphology between PANI matrix and TERGO powders, confirming a physical interaction between both morphologies. The amount of TERGO particles into the polymeric matrix also modifies the sample microstructure from a semispherical shape to extend sheets, where PANI is sandwiched between TERGO layers. Electrical conductivity of composites slightly increases independent of the TERGO amount (30 S/m and 39 S/m) due to the rough TERGO surface that conditioned the homogeneous nucleation of a large amount of polymer (PANI) reducing the area to move the electrical charge.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with straight geometries have been widely studied for various engineering applications, and they are often treated or functionalized to improve their effectiveness, depending on their role and expected performance. However, helical configurations of CNTs (HCNTs) have not been sufficiently investigated, especially in their functionalized states for high-performance nanocomposite applications. The coil-shaped geometry of these HCNTs increases the mechanical entanglement of these nanotubes with a host resin system when they are used as reinforcements. This consequently has the potential to improve the mechanical, thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties of the polymeric matrix systems. A uniform dispersion of CNTs in the resin plays an important role in obtaining improved and consistent properties in the final nanocomposite part. To improve the homogeneous dispersion (individual suspension) of these nanotubes in the host resin and to enhance their interactions/bonds with the resin molecules, the surface of these nanotubes should be modified. This study investigates a sonication method for chemical functionalization of HCNTs using a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids with 3 to 1 mixing ratio [3 : 1], and it evaluates the effects of acid concentrations and sonication time on the severity of the functionalization process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the process parameters, the functionalized HCNTs (FHCNTs) were examined using several characterization instruments and techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), visual dispersion test, and Raman spectroscopy. The characterization results confirmed that the changes in process parameters were mostly effective and the atomic structures of the functionalized HCNTs were successfully altered. All FHCNT samples demonstrated higher dispersion uniformity, increase in Raman ID/IG ratios, and changes in the FTIR spectra compared to the pristine HCNTs. Most of the FHCNTs had a reduction in crystallinity, which was consistent with our expectation that functionalization generates more defects on the surface structure of HCNTs, thus leading to a lower intensity of the graphitic peak. The largest reduction in crystallinity was seen for HCNTs treated with a 16 molarity acidic solution; therefore, the HCNTs that were treated with lower molarity acids could be used for further studies and explored for their effective applications in improving the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of polymeric nanocomposites.},

abstract = {Humanity has long strived to create microscopic machines for various purposes. Most prominent of them employ nanorobots for medical purposes and procedures, otherwise deemed hard or impossible to perform. However, the main advantage of this kind of machines is also their main drawback—their small size. The miniature scale, they work in, brings many problems, such as not having enough space for the computational power needed for their operation or the specifics of the laws of physics that govern their behaviour. In our study, we focus on the former challenge, by introducing a new standpoint to the well-studied predator-prey pursuit problem using an implementation of very simple predator agents. Intended to model the small-scale (micro and nano) robots, these agents are morphologically simple—they feature a single line-of-sight sensor. The behaviour of the predator agents is simple as well—the (few) perceived environmental variables are mapped directly into corresponding pairs of rotational velocities of the wheels’ motors. We implemented genetic algorithm to evolve such a mapping that results in a successful capturing of the prey by the team of predator agents. However, as the preliminary results indicated, the predators that use a straightforward sensor could not resolve more than just few of the tested initial situations. Thus, to improve the generality of the evolved behaviour, we proposed an asymmetric sensory morphology of predators—an angular offset to the sensor relative to the longitudinal axis—and coevolved the amount of such an offset together with the behaviour of predators. The behaviours, coevolved with a sensor offset between 12° and 38°, resulted in both an efficient and consistent capture of the prey in all tested initial situations. Moreover, some of the behaviours, coevolved with sensor offset between 18° and 24°, demonstrated a good generality to the increased speed of the prey and a good robustness to perception noise. The obtained results could be seen as a step towards the engineering of asymmetric small-scale for delivery of medicine, locating and destroying cancer cells, microscopic imaging, etc.},

abstract = {Abrasion performance is an important index for evaluating the performance of rubber products. The surface morphologies of rubber composites under different temperatures and loads were characterized based on fractal theory. The abrasion performance and characteristics of the surface morphology of rubber were investigated. Images of surface morphology of rubber samples were collected by a 3D measuring laser microscope and converted to black-and-white binary images. Based on the multifractal model, the relationship between the experimental conditions and the characteristic parameters of the abrasion surfaces, such as the width of multifractal spectrum Δ?, the change in the multifractal spectrum Δf(?), wave length, wave height and the root mean square deviation of the outline were quantitatively analyzed. The results show that abrasion volume increased as the temperature increased. Similarly, abrasion volume increased as load increased. As the temperature or the load increases, the abrasion of the rubber surface increases in intensity and volume, the abrasion surface becomes more uneven, and the abrasive grain becomes more complex. The characteristic parameters, such as the wave length and wave height of the abrasive grain, the arithmetic mean deviation of the outline, the root mean square deviation of the outline and the 3D arithmetic mean deviation, increase in certain regularity.},

abstract = {Due to the complexity of the rubber wear process, the research work of the wear mechanism is limited to normal temperature, and the mechanism of high temperature wear has not been established. The temperature has great influence on the appearance of wear and the change of the surface characteristics of wear. This paper presents the wear surface morphology of rubber materials at different temperatures. The two-dimensional gray level images of the rubber surface are captured by a 3D measuring laser microscope and are converted to black-and-white binary images. Then, the quantitative analysis of the wear surface is processed using fractal dimension and the multifractal spectrum method. Results show that the wear rubber surface is fractal. Additionally, the roughness and the spectral width values increases with increase in temperature. Furthermore, the fractal dimensions shrink and the homogeneity of the rubber surface worsens. As temperature increases, the corresponding Δ\'{y} and Δf(\'{y}) increase, resulting in rough wear surface with lower height homogeneity and higher complexity. Δ\'{y} is equal to 0.238, 0.281 and 0.283 at the temperature of 25, 60 and 80 °C, respectively. Δf(\'{y}) is equal to 0.027, 0.035 and 0.039 at the temperature of 25, 60 and 80 °C, respectively. In conclusion, fractal theory can be used to describe and evaluate the surface morphology and wear characteristics of rubber materials.},

The effect of growth temperature on morphology and growth rate for InAs and InAs/GaSb heterostructure NWs were investigated. A combination of high material flow rates and optimum temperature (600 °C) has given better crystal quality of InAs nanowires. The morphology and shell thickness of NWs as observed by scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements can be tuned by the growth temperature. Electron microscopy also shows the formation of GaSb both in radial and axial directions outside the InAs NW core at certain growth temperatures. Crystal structure of InAs and InAs/GaSb heterostructure NWs was analyzed by high-resolution TEM and fast Fourier transform analysis. Using good crystalline InAs core grown at optimized growth temperature (600 °C), GaSb shell has been grown without any misfit dislocations at the core-shell interface. Basic electrical properties have been measured by forming ohmic contacts. I–V characteristics exhibit linear response indicating good ohmic behavior. These results show good control over InAs NWs growth, the GaSb shell thickness, and its crystal quality, which are essential for future nanoelectronic devices such as tunneling FET.},

One of the most commonly used shapes is the ellipse which is of great importance for many industrial and biomedical applications. In this study, a novel technique is proposed for segmenting and separating of overlapped elliptical shape objects using concavity analysis and several morphological image processing techniques. A comparative study of the detection speed and accuracy of elliptical objects between Iterative Random Hough Transformation (IRHT) algorithm approach and Direct Least Squares Fitting (DLSF) of Ellipses method has shown the great superiority of DLSF in both the speed and accuracy of recognition. The validation of the proposed techniques for segmentation and detection along with calculation of the efficiency of the system has shown those techniques to be robust and effective for automation of synthetic and real elliptical shapes. The red blood cells (RBCs) microscopic images of the blood smear in Hereditary Elliptocytosis disorder is studied as real elliptical shapes and a quantitative analysis was implemented on the detected RBCs, where the distribution parameters of the ellipse size (area), Roundness, Eccentricity, and Ellipticity are estimated in addition to RBCs counting. The proposed detection approach is successful in building a fully autonomous and accurate system with ellipse analysis capabilities.},

The influence of growth temperature of ZnO ranging from 90 to 190 °C by the high temperature hydrothermal method was investigated. The ZnO nanorod array were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction pattern. From FE-SEM results, the morphology of ZnO nanorods changes from hexagonal structure to sponge-like shape as the growth temperature increases. When the growth temperature is below 150 °C, hexagonal nanorod growth is observed. On the other hand, when the growth temperature is above 170 °C sheet growth is found. In the gas sensor measurements, it is found that ZnO nanorod grown at 150 °C has the best gas sensing performance due to its least intrinsic defects in this study.},

First, curvature similarity between corners are for the first time explored for the purpose of multimodal image registration. Second, a novel local descriptor called Distribution of Edge Pixels Along Contour (DEPAC) is proposed to represent the edges in the neighborhood of corners. Third, a simple yet effective way of estimating scale difference is proposed by making use of geometric relationships between corner triplets from the reference and target images. Using a set of benchmark multimodal images and multimodal microscopic images, we will demonstrate that our proposed technique outperforms a state-of-the-art multimodal image registration technique.},

abstract = {Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy is widely used for observing unstained biological samples that are otherwise optically transparent. Combining this optical technique with machine vision could enable the automation of many life science experiments; however, identifying relevant features under DIC is challenging. In particular, precise tracking of cell boundaries in a thick ( ${&gt;} 100 mu text{m}$ ) slice of tissue has not previously been accomplished. We present a novel deconvolution algorithm that achieves the state-of-the-art performance at identifying and tracking these membrane locations. Our proposed algorithm is formulated as a regularized least squares optimization that incorporates a filtering mechanism to handle organic tissue interference and a robust edge-sparsity regularizer that integrates dynamic edge tracking capabilities. As a secondary contribution, this paper also describes new community infrastructure in the form of a MATLAB toolbox for accurately simulating DIC microscopy images of in vitro brain slices. Building on existing DIC optics modeling, our simulation framework additionally contributes an accurate representation of interference from organic tissue, neuronal cell-shapes, and tissue motion due to the action of the pipette. This simulator allows us to better understand the image statistics (to improve algorithms), as well as quantitatively test cell segmentation and tracking algorithms in scenarios, where ground truth data is fully known.},

Meanwhile, the crystal morphology, particle size, crystal structure, thermal decomposition properties, and impact sensitivity properties of the raw materials of TATB, the prepared nano-TATB particles, and the TATB/VitonA nanocomposites were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), laser particle size analyzer (LPSA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and impact sensitivity instrument. The detonation performances of TATB/VitonA were calculated by the EXPLO5 program. The results indicated that the size of TATB/VitonA nanocomposites was 0.5–1 μm. The results also indicated that TATB/VitonA nanocomposites were composed of many nano-TATB particles (40–60 nm). The crystal structure of TATB/VitonA nanoparticles was not changed. The activation energy of TATB/VitonA nanocomposites was higher than nano-TATB particles by 42.62 kJ·mol−1, and the characteristic drop of the proportion of TATB/VitonA nanocomposites was higher than nano-TATB particles by 13.8 cm. The thermal stability of TATB/VitonA nanocomposites was higher, while their mechanical sensitivities were lower, which showed potential for sustainable use in the field of energetic materials.},

abstract = {A series of nanoporous sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) hydrogel beads were prepared using FeCl3 ionic crosslinker by changing polymer and crosslinker percentages (%). Characteristics of the hydrogels were investigated by gel content, swelling test, degradation test, Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM/EDX), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Swelling experiments were studied by changing time, temperature, and pH. The swelling percentage (S%) regularly decreased with increasing the amounts of polymer and crosslinker, in contrast with gel content results. NaCMC hydrogels were found to be sensitive to pH variations. The degradation test showed that hydrogels had good stability and their degradation period varied from 30 to 36 days. According to SEM analysis, NaCMC hydrogels had mostly nanoporous structure. The average granule and pore sizes of the least swollen NaCMC-12 hydrogel were found to be 13.1±0.3 nm and 82.1±3.2 nm. The elemental compositions of hydrogels were determined with EDX. The minimum average surface roughness (Ra) and root mean square roughness (Rms) parameters were found to be 15.7±1.9 nm and 20.3±2.2 nm for NaCMC-12 hydrogels by AFM. Due to their good morphologies, stabilities, and swelling behaviors, NaCMC hydrogels can be suitable for biomaterial applications.},

abstract = {This study designed an efficient one-step method for synthesizing carbon-based nanofluids (CBNFs). The method employs the vortex trap method (VTM) and an oxygen-acetylene flame, serving as a carbon source, in a manufacturing system of the VTM (MSVTM). The flow rate ratio of O2 and C2H2 was adjusted to form suitable combustion conditions for the reduced flame. Four flow rate ratios of O2 and C2H2 were used: 1.5 : 2.5 (V1), 1.0 : 2.5 (V2), 0.5 : 2.5 (V3), and 0 : 2.5 (V4). The morphology, structure, particle size, stability, and basic physicochemical characteristics of the obtained carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNMs) and CBNFs were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrometry, ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared spectrophotometry, and a particle size-zeta potential analyzer. The static positioning method was utilized to evaluate the stability of the CBNFs with added EP dispersants. The evaluation results revealed the morphologies, compositions, and concentrations of the CBNFs obtained using various process parameters, and the relation between processing time and production rate was determined. Among the CBNMs synthesized, those obtained using the V4-0 flow rate ratio had the highest stability when no EP dispersant was added. Moreover, the maximum enhancement ratios of the viscosity and thermal conductivity were also obtained for V4-0: 4.65% and 1.29%, respectively. Different types and concentrations of dispersants should be considered in future research to enhance the stability of CBNFs for further application.},

abstract = {To prepare an antimicrobial polymer composite composed of silver- (Ag-) polyethyleneimine- (PEI-) polylactic acid (PLA) in chloroform, for coating the mucosal surfaces of methacrylate-based dentures as a prospective therapy for denture stomatitis. The water-insoluble, tightly bound, hard, micrometre-thin, and colourless film exerts its effects by direct contact with the pathogens and via the active constituents (Ag, PEI, and Ag-PEI) released slowly into the mucosa’s salivary layer. Silver and PEI were blended at 140°C, then bound to PLA. The Ag-PEI complex was characterised by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, and the Ag-PEI-PLA composite was examined by atomic force microscopy and micro-computed tomography. The characteristic was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The quantity of water-soluble Ag-PEI complex released from the composite film was measured with gravimetry. The cellular physiological effects were analysed by impedimetry and computer-based morphometry using human gingival epithelial cells. A real-time cell proliferation assay revealed moderate toxic effects of Ag-PEI on the epithelium. The viscous Ag-PEI-PLA solution produced could be applied as a thin film on methacrylate surfaces. Active antimicrobial components (Ag, PEI, and Ag-PEI) were released from the hard, tightly bound Ag-PEI-PLA coating. This study’s findings verified the applicability of the antimicrobial Ag-PEI-PLA composite for coating the inner surfaces of acrylate dentures. Owing to the well-known antimicrobial effects of silver and PEI and the supplementary effects of chloroform, this composite provides a new therapeutic method for denture stomatitis that can be easily performed by dentists.},

Specifically, our analysis focuses on the tensorial coefficients in the governing mean field equation---including both the leading order (i.e., quasi-static) terms, and their second-order companions bearing the effects of incipient wave dispersion. The results demonstrate that the sought sensitivities are computable in terms of (i) three unit cell solutions used to formulate the unperturbed macroscopic model; (ii) two adoint-field solutions driven by the mass density variation inside the unperturbed unit cell; and (iii) the usual polarization tensor, appearing in the related studies of nonperiodic media, that synthesizes the geometric and constitutive features of a point-like perturbation. The proposed developments may be useful toward (a) the design of periodic media to manipulate macroscopic waves via the microstructure-generated effects of dispersion and anisotropy, and (b) subwavelength sensing of periodic defects or perturbations.},

abstract = {Data analytics have become increasingly complicated as the amount of data has increased. One technique that is used to enable data analytics in large datasets is data sampling, in which a portion of the data is selected to preserve the data characteristics for use in data analytics. In this paper, we introduce a novel data sampling technique that is rooted in formal concept analysis theory. This technique is used to create samples reliant on the data distribution across a set of binary patterns. The proposed sampling technique is applied in classifying the regions of breast cancer histology images as malignant or benign. The performance of our method is compared to other classical sampling methods. The results indicate that our method is efficient and generates an illustrative sample of small size. It is also competing with other sampling methods in terms of sample size and sample quality represented in classification accuracy and F1 measure. Breast cancer histology images have a massive amount of data to be analyzed.A novel data sampling method is proposed to generate discriminative samples.The generated samples respect data distribution and consider all input features.The method is adopted with classification algorithms to identify the pixels as malignant or benign.},

abstract = {A segmentation method of lymphoma histological images is proposed.A public image dataset was used for the method evaluation.The proposed method is based on genetic algorithm and fuzzy 3-partition entropy.Neoplastic cells of different lymphomas were successfully identified.In comparison with other methods, this has reached the best results. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common cancer of the lymphatic system and should be considered as a group of several closely related cancers, which can show differences in their growth patterns, their impact on the body and how they are treated. The diagnosis of the different types of neoplasia is made by a specialist through the analysis of histological images. However, these analyses are complex and the same case can lead to different understandings among pathologists, due to the exhaustive analysis of decisions, the time required and the presence of complex histological features. In this context, computational algorithms can be applied as tools to aid specialists through the application of segmentation methods to identify regions of interest that are essential for lymphomas diagnosis. In this paper, an unsupervised method for segmentation of nuclear components of neoplastic cells is proposed to analyze histological images of lymphoma stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The proposed method is based on the association among histogram equalization, Gaussian filter, fuzzy 3-partition entropy, genetic algorithm, morphological techniques and the valley-emphasis method in order to analyze neoplastic nuclear components, improve the contrast and illumination conditions, remove noise, split overlapping cells and refine contours. The results were evaluated through comparisons with those provided by a specialist and techniques available in the literature considering the metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and variation of information. The mean value of accuracy for the proposed method was 81.48%. Although the method obtained sensitivity rates between 41% and 51%, the accuracy values showed relevance when compared to those provided by other studies. Therefore, the novelties presented here may already encourage new studies with a more comprehensive overview of lymphoma segmentation.},

abstract = {This paper introducesnear-set based segmentation method for extraction and quantification of mucin regions for detecting mucinouscarcinoma (MC which is a sub type of Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)). From histology point of view, the presence of mucin is one of the indicators for detection of this carcinoma. In order to detect MC, the proposed method majorly includes pre-processing by colour correction, colour transformation followed by near-set based segmentation and post-processing for delineating only mucin regions from the histological images at 40 . The segmentation step works in two phases such as Learn and Run.In pre-processing step, white balance method is used for colour correction of microscopic images (RGB format). These images are transformed into HSI (Hue, Saturation, and Intensity) colour space and H-plane is extracted in order to get better visual separation of the different histological regions (background, mucin and tissue regions). Thereafter, histogram in H-plane is optimally partitioned to find set representation for each of the regions. In Learn phase, features of typical mucin pixel and unlabeled pixels are learnt in terms of coverage of observed sets in the sample space surrounding the pixel under consideration. On the other hand, in Run phase the unlabeled pixels are clustered as mucin and non-mucin based on its indiscernibilty with ideal mucin, i.e. their feature values differ within a tolerance limit. This experiment is performed for grade-I and grade-II of MC and hence percentage of average segmentation accuracy is achieved within confidence interval of [97.36 97.70] for extracting mucin areas. In addition, computation of percentage of mucin present in a histological image is provided for understanding the alteration of such diagnostic indicator in MC detection.},

abstract = {Accurately modeling how light interacts with cloth is challenging, due to the volumetric nature of cloth appearance and its multiscale structure, where microstructures play a major role in the overall appearance at higher scales. Recently, significant effort has been put on developing better microscopic models for cloth structure, which have allowed rendering fabrics with unprecedented fidelity. However, these highly-detailed representations still make severe simplifications on the scattering by individual fibers forming the cloth, ignoring the impact of fibers' shape, and avoiding to establish connections between the fibers' appearance and their optical and fabrication parameters. In this work we put our focus in the scattering of individual cloth fibers; we introduce a physically-based scattering model for fibers based on their low-level optical and geometric properties, relying on the extensive textile literature for accurate data. We demonstrate that scattering from cloth fibers exhibits much more complexity than current fiber models, showing important differences between cloth type, even in averaged conditions due to longer views. Our model can be plugged in any framework for cloth rendering, matches scattering measurements from real yarns, and is based on actual parameters used in the textile industry, allowing predictive bottom-up definition of cloth appearance.},

The objective of this study was to derive a CNT-based thin film strain sensor model using inputs from nano-/micro-scale experimental measurements of nanotube physical properties. This study began with fabricating ultra-low-concentration CNT-polymer thin films, followed by imaging them using atomic force microscopy. Image processing was employed for characterizing CNT dispersed shapes, lengths, and other physical attributes, and results were used for building five different types of thin film percolation-based models. Numerical simulations were conducted to assess how the morphology of dispersed CNTs in its 2D matrix affected bulk film electrical and electromechanical (strain sensing) properties. The simulation results showed that CNT morphology had a significant impact on strain sensing performance.},

abstract = {The correct and consistent identification of the petrographic properties of coal is an important issue for researchers in the fields of mining and geology. As part of the study described in this paper, investigations concerning the application of artificial intelligence methods for the identification of the aforementioned characteristics were carried out. The methods in question were used to identify the maceral groups of coal, i.e. vitrinite, inertinite, and liptinite. Additionally, an attempt was made to identify some non-organic minerals. The analyses were performed using pattern recognition techniques (NN, kNN), as well as artificial neural network techniques (a multilayer perceptron MLP). The classification process was carried out using microscopy images of polished sections of coals. A multidimensional feature space was defined, which made it possible to classify the discussed structures automatically, based on the methods of pattern recognition and algorithms of the artificial neural networks. Also, from the study we assessed the impact of the parameters for which the applied methods proved effective upon the final outcome of the classification procedure. The result of the analyses was a high percentage (over 97%) of correct classifications of maceral groups and mineral components. The paper discusses also an attempt to analyze particular macerals of the inertinite group. It was demonstrated that using artificial neural networks to this end makes it possible to classify the macerals properly in over 91% of cases. Thus, it was proved that artificial intelligence methods can be successfully applied for the identification of selected petrographic features of coal. The automatic classification of maceral groups and mineral matter in hard coal using AI was proposed.The efficiency of pattern recognition and artificial neural networks was compared.A high rate of compatibility of automatic classification with petrographers' decisions was achieved.The results prove the usefulness of AI in supporting of quantitative analyses of hard coal.},

The flexible nanogenerator (NG) is developed from well- aligned ZnO nanorods (NRs) on kapton substrate with ITO sputtered bottom contact using the low-temperature hydrothermal method. PMMA insulation region is coated over NRs with silver (Ag) as top electrode to reduce the external screening effect thereby improving the output signal strength. The crystalline and morphological properties of the NRs are studied using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence.The current–voltage characteristics of the ZnO NRs exhibited a clear rectifying behavior, attributed to the formation of a Schottky contact between ZnO and Ag contact with an insulation of PMMA layer. An experimental study to evaluate the device performance is carried out using tip excitation method. The synthesized NG generates open-circuit voltage of 400&nbsp;mV, circuit current across optimum load of 10&nbsp;kΩ is 30&nbsp;μA, and giving a maximum power density of 9&nbsp;μ Wcm–2 at a force of 0.5&nbsp;N at 12&nbsp;Hz.

The transistor is embedded in a deep n-well forming a flat pn-junction with the p-substrate, with the shape of the pn-junction resolved in the SMM images. Calibrated dC/dV imaging of the device revealed doping concentration values in the range of 1015–1019 atoms/cm 3, including the p-body, n-drift region, n-source-diffusion, as well as all the pn-junctions and the silicon/oxide interfaces at a minimum feature size of 350&nbsp;nm and SMM electrical resolution of 60&nbsp;nm. SMM doping concentrations have been compared with technology computer-aided design simulations, resulting in a quantitative agreement between model and experiment. dC/dV images have been acquired at different tip dc bias voltages, allowing to determine the p and n dopant polarity. From the reflection scattering S11  signal calibrated capacitance measurements have been obtained from the various transistor regions in the range of 300 aF to 1 fF.

abstract = {Display Omitted Pathologists reviewed digital whole slide images and rendered diagnoses.During interpretation, eye movements and image navigation behavior were recorded.Pathologist experience positively predicted accuracy.Case characteristics and eye movement patterns interactively predicted accuracy.Higher zooming behavior predicted diagnostic over-interpretation. Digital whole slide imaging is an increasingly common medium in pathology, with application to education, telemedicine, and rendering second opinions. It has also made it possible to use eye tracking devices to explore the dynamic visual inspection and interpretation of histopathological features of tissue while pathologists review cases. Using whole slide images, the present study examined how a pathologists diagnosis is influenced by fixed case-level factors, their prior clinical experience, and their patterns of visual inspection. Participating pathologists interpreted one of two test sets, each containing 12 digital whole slide images of breast biopsy specimens. Cases represented four diagnostic categories as determined via expert consensus: benign without atypia, atypia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive cancer. Each case included one or more regions of interest (ROIs) previously determined as of critical diagnostic importance. During pathologist interpretation we tracked eye movements, viewer tool behavior (zooming, panning), and interpretation time. Models were built using logistic and linear regression with generalized estimating equations, testing whether variables at the level of the pathologists, cases, and visual interpretive behavior would independently and/or interactively predict diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Diagnostic accuracy varied as a function of case consensus diagnosis, replicating earlier research. As would be expected, benign cases tended to elicit false positives, and atypia, DCIS, and invasive cases tended to elicit false negatives. Pathologist experience levels, case consensus diagnosis, case difficulty, eye fixation durations, and the extent to which pathologists eyes fixated within versus outside of diagnostic ROIs, all independently or interactively predicted diagnostic accuracy. Higher zooming behavior predicted a tendency to over-interpret benign and atypia cases, but not DCIS cases. Efficiency was not predicted by pathologist- or visual search-level variables. Results provide new insights into the medical interpretive process and demonstrate the complex interactions between pathologists and cases that guide diagnostic decision-making. Implications for training, clinical practice, and computer-aided decision aids are considered.},

abstract = {A silicon and PMMA (poly-(methyl methacrylate)) retinal tack with barbs is developed for retinal prostheses. The MEMS retinal tack presented in this paper has barbs, which are intended for the fixation of the epiretinal-type retina-stimulating microelectrode array. Although conventional retinal tacks made of titanium are available, they are expensive, invasive, and restricted in shape. The silicon retinal tack is fabricated using silicon micromachining, and the PMMA retinal tack is fabricated by X-ray lithography for accurate micro-patterning, which is very scalable and is suitable for inexpensive and repeatable mass production. In this paper, long-term in vivo biocompatibility evaluation of silicon and PMMA retinal tacks is presented. The MEMS retina tack is implanted with epiretinal microelectrodes onto the retinal surface of the rabbit eye and harvested after 1 year for the silicon retinal tack and 6 months for the PMMA retinal tack. Through histological examination, no inflammatory infiltrates in retina, choroid, nor sclera are revealed. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show no chemical reaction trace nor mechanical fracture of the implanted device. The results indicate that both silicon and PMMA retinal tacks are suitable for mechanical fixation of microelectrode arrays. Also, the long-term evaluation of the durability in vivo shows acceptable biocompatibility for further use in retinal prostheses.},

The PS-nTiO2 synthesized via in situ differential microemulsion polymerization displayed a core-shell morphology (nTiO2 core and PS shell) with an average diameter of 42 nm. The cure characteristics (scorch time, cure time, and cure rate index), mechanical properties (tensile properties, tear strength, and hardness), thermal stability, glass transition temperature, and morphology of the prepared nanocomposites were quantified and compared. The results showed that the cure characteristics of all the nanocomposites were not significantly changed compared to those of the neat NR/SBR blend. The inclusion of an appropriate amount of either nTiO2 or PS-nTiO2 into the NR/SBR blend apparently improved the tensile strength, modulus at 300% strain, tear strength, hardness, and thermal stability but deteriorated the elongation at break of the nanocomposites. Based on differential scanning calorimetry, the glass transition temperature of all the nanocomposites was similar to that of the neat NR/SBR blend. Moreover, the morphology of the PS-nTiO2-filled rubber nanocomposites fractured surface analyzed by scanning electron microscopy showed an improvement in the interfacial adhesion between the rubber phase and the nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Gadolinium oxysulfide nanophosphors (Gd2O2S-NPs) have been successfully synthesized using γ-irradiation and hydrogenation treatment. The primary stage of Gd2O2S-NPs synthesis was carried out using various doses of γ-irradiation to form diverse sizes of Gd2(SO4)3 precursor, followed by hydrogenation treatment at 900°C for 2 hours to form Gd2O2S-NPs. Then, the nanophosphors were characterized for the structure, morphology, and luminescence properties through X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and photoluminescence spectrometer (PL). Pure hexagonal phase of Gd2O2S-NPs was obtained with high crystallinity and without any impurities. The morphologies were observed from grain-like nanostructures transformed to spherical shape as the irradiation dose reached 40 kGy. Besides, Gd2O2S-NPs which were prepared at highest irradiation dose of 40 kGy show highest intensity of emission peak at 548 nm and corresponded to Stark level transition from the GJ6 state of Gd3+ ion. It can be emphasized that the different doses of γ-irradiation influenced the nucleation event of Gd2(SO4)3 precursor thus affecting the morphology and size particles of Gd2O2S-NPs. Hence, from the results, it can be suggested that Gd2O2S-NPs can be a promising host for optical applications.},

HMX/F2602 microspheres were successfully prepared by using HMX and F2602 as the main explosive and binder, respectively. The particle morphology, particle size, crystal structure, thermal stability, and impact sensitivity of the as-prepared HMX/F2602 microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser particle size analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and impact sensitivity test, respectively. The SEM analysis indicated successful coating of F2602 on the surface of HMX, and the resulting particles are ellipsoidal or spherical with a median particle size of 940 nm; the XRD analysis did not show any change in the crystal structure after the coating and still has β-HNX crystal structure; according to the DSC analysis, HMX/F2602 prepared by the new method has better thermal stability compared to that prepared by the water suspension process. The impact sensitivity of HMX/F2602 prepared by this one-step granulation process decreased, and its characteristic height H50 increased from 37.62 to 40.13 cm, thus significantly improving the safety performance. More importantly, this method does not need the freeze-drying process after recrystallization, thus increasing the efficiency by 2 to 3 times.},

The core shell nanocomposites (FA-PEG-PEI@SPION-CDDP-TFPI-2) were composed of superparamagnetic Fe3O4 core that binds CDDP and TFPI-2 shell that combines with folate-polyethylene glycol-polyethyleneimine (FA-PEG-PEI) via electrostatic interaction. The shell containing FA-PEG-PEI and TFPI-2 plasmid was synthesized through amidation reaction and electrostatic adsorption and the core containing SPION-CDDP was modified by aldehyde sodium alginate. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectra on FA-PEG-PEI polymers showed characteristic peaks of various metabolites in corresponding frequency. Transmission electron microscopy image of FA-PEG-PEI@SPION-CDDP-TFPI-2 nanoparticles demonstrated a near-monodisperse spherical morphology, while dynamic light scattering studies indicated an intensity-average diameter of 149.5 nm. Zeta potential was 14.89 ± 1.83 mv and the final concentration of loaded CDDP was 100 ug/ml. Gel electrophoresis data showed that the nanocomposite would protect TFPI-2 pDNA from being digested by DNases. Compared with CNE-2 cells, the good targetability and better gene transfection efficiency (57.9%) were detected by Prussian blue iron stain and fluorescence analysis in HNE-1 cells in vitro. The results suggested the potential application of FA-PEG-PEI@SPION-CDDP-TFPI-2 as a multifunctional anticancer nanomedicine on targeting therapy for FR positive NPC.},

It has outstanding etching characteristics such as compatibility with semiconductor processes and provides high etch selectivity between silicon and silicon dioxide. In this work, we have investigated the effect of surfactant concentration ranging from 20 ppb to 1000 ppm on the etching characteristics of 25 wt% TMAH for bulk micromachining of Si{100} and Si{110}. Triton X-100 with formula C14H22O(C2H4O)n, where n = 9---10, is used as surfactant. The major objective of this work is to determine the surfactant concentration at which the etch rate, etched surface morphology and convex corner undercutting are significantly affected. Undercutting length and etched depth are measured using 3D scanning optical microscope. Surface morphology of etched silicon samples are inspected using scanning electron microscope. The surfactant concentration below 100 ppb does not affect etching characteristics significantly, while the effect of surfactant concentration above 100 ppb is substantial on the undercutting at convex corners on Si{100} surface, etch rate and etched surface roughness of Si{110}. The etch rate and etched surface morphology of Si{100} are not influenced considerably when the surfactant is added into 25 wt% TMAH.},

abstract = {Volume is one of the most important features to characterise a tumour.Multicellular spheroids are commonly used as 3D tumour models.We revised the exiting single-image based volume assessment methods for spheroids.We validated ReViSP using a light-sheet fluorescent microscope, and upgraded it.We presented a novel approach to assess effectiveness of volume estimation method. BackgroundCancer multicellular spheroids are commonly used as 3D tumour models for testing drugs and radiotherapy treatments. The volume plays a key role in analysis of the results. Several methods have been proposed in the literature to compute the spheroid's volume from one 2D microscopy image (i.e. a single projection). However, the literature lacks reviews summarising the different methods available. Furthermore, there are no well-established approaches by which to compare the different methods and determine the best one. ObjectiveIn this work we (a) revise the existing single-image based methods used to estimate the volume of multicellular spheroids, also providing different implementations for classical spherical and ellipsoidal pre-defined models; (b) present an upgrade of a volume estimation software recently proposed, Reconstruction and Visualization from a Single Projection (ReViSP), just validated by using four real spheroids imaged in 3D with a light-sheet microscope; (c) propose a quality assessing approach for single-image based methods, relying on 3D home-made macroscopic synthetic models mimicking the shapes of real multicellular spheroids. ResultsSeven image-based methods used to estimate the volume of spheroids were compared using six 3D home-made synthetic models. First, the material used to make the synthetic models was characterised to estimate its density. Then, the ground-truth volume of the 3D models was measured by simply weighing them. The volume instances estimated by the different methods were compared with ground truth. ReViSP attained the best result three times out of six and on average. ConclusionsThe results obtained proved that (a) different implementations for the classical spherical and ellipsoidal pre-defined models may lead to very different results; (b) ReViSP is the best single-image based method available today to estimate the volume of multicellular spheroids.},

abstract = {HighlightsTheoretical-practical study using Computer Aided Diagnosis and Morphometry concepts.The method aggregates the content of nuclei in microscopic images.The images are characterized by morphometric information and other attributes.The attributes were extracted using traditional object extraction algorithms.The method augments traditional image processing.Software allowed automatic classification of nuclei of thyroid in microscopic images. BackgroundThe analyses of several systems for medical-imaging processing typically support the extraction of image attributes, but do not comprise some information that characterizes images. For example, morphometry can be applied to find new information about the visual content of an image. The extension of information may result in knowledge. Subsequently, results of mappings can be applied to recognize exam patterns, thus improving the accuracy of image retrieval and allowing a better interpretation of exam results. Although successfully applied in breast lesion images, the morphometric approach is still poorly explored in thyroid lesions due to the high subjectivity thyroid examinations. ObjectiveThis paper presents a theoretical-practical study, considering Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) and Morphometry, to reduce the semantic discontinuity between medical image features and human interpretation of image content. MethodThe proposed method aggregates the content of microscopic images characterized by morphometric information and other image attributes extracted by traditional object extraction algorithms. This method carries out segmentation, feature extraction, image labeling and classification. Morphometric analysis was included as an object extraction method in order to verify the improvement of its accuracy for automatic classification of microscopic images. ResultsTo validate this proposal and verify the utility of morphometric information to characterize thyroid images, a CAD system was created to classify real thyroid image-exams into Papillary Cancer, Goiter and Non-Cancer. Results showed that morphometric information can improve the accuracy and precision of image retrieval and the interpretation of results in computer-aided diagnosis. For example, in the scenario where all the extractors are combined with the morphometric information, the CAD system had its best performance (70% of precision in Papillary cases). ConclusionResults signalized a positive use of morphometric information from images to reduce semantic discontinuity between human interpretation and image characterization.},

Background and objectiveIntegrative approaches for the study of biological systems have gained popularity in the realm of statistical genomics. For example, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has applied integrative clustering methodologies to various cancer types to determine molecular subtypes within a given cancer histology. In order to adequately compare integrative or "systems-biology"-type methods, realistic and related datasets are needed to assess the methods. This involves simulating multiple types of 'omic data with realistic correlation between features of the same type (e.g., gene expression for genes in a pathway) and across data types (e.g., "gene silencing" involving DNA methylation and gene expression). MethodsWe present the software application tool InterSIM for simulating multiple interrelated data types with realistic intra- and inter-relationships based on the DNA methylation, mRNA gene expression, and protein expression from the TCGA ovarian cancer study. ResultsThe resulting simulated datasets can be used to assess and compare the operating characteristics of newly developed integrative bioinformatics methods to existing methods. Application of InterSIM is presented with an example of heatmaps of the simulated datasets.

An autonomous CFC system controls vehicle acceleration to optimize its own situation, whereas a cooperative CFC (C-CFC) system coordinates accelerations of cooperative vehicles to optimize the joint situation. To realize simultaneous control of many vehicles in a traffic system, decentralized and distributed algorithms are implemented in a microscopic traffic simulator for CFC and C-CFC controllers, respectively. The impacts of the proposed controllers on dynamic traffic flow features, particularly on formation and propagation of moving jams, are investigated through a simulation on a two-lane freeway with CFC/C-CFC vehicles randomly distributed. The simulation shows that the proposed decentralized CFC and distributed C-CFC algorithms are implementable in microscopic simulations, and the assessment reveals that CFC and C-CFC systems change moving jam characteristics substantially.},

abstract = {The most critical challenge of circuit edit is the scaling of nano-machined features to the ever-decreasing minimum dimensions of VLSI process technologies. A key enabler for achieving small nano-machined feature sizes is a narrow focused ion beam (FIB) profile. Thus, the analysis of FIB profiles and their characteristic widths yields useful criteria of suitability for advanced circuit edit and other nano-machining applications. We present herein, the details of an analysis method of ion beam profiles based on amorphization traces produced by the beam when scanned over a 001 Si single crystal sample, with increasing doses. The amorphized region widths are measured by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The analysis, relying on TRIM simulation, yields the transverse current density of a beam as a sum of two Gaussians and an exponential, and includes error estimates. Successful beam analyses of several modern FIB columns have been performed. We believe that this methodological approach to beam profile analysis may be used to advantage by FIB column manufacturers for characterization and development. Display Omitted An analysis method suited for ion beam profiles of small probe size, is presented in detail.Amorphization traces in Si, are least-squares fitted to a TRIM derived damage function.A best parameterized beam profile is obtained assuming the form of two Gaussians and one exponential.A best parameterized beam profile is obtained assuming the form of two Gaussians and one exponential.Several relatively new FIBs have only (~ 5-10%) of beam current in tails, and are advantageous for nanomachining.},

abstract = {Metallic nanoparticles have been focus of research because of their characteristic properties, specifically the LSPR which can have wide applications in biomedical sciences and engineering. Currently, traditional physical and chemical methods can synthesize these nanoparticles but their disadvantages such as costs, time, effectiveness, and toxicity of precursors provide a wide range of problems for the synthesis of these nanoparticles. Recently, some natural polymers and organic compounds have been used for the synthesis of nanoparticles by green methods. In this study, we synthesize copper, silver, and gold nanoparticles using sodium alginate as reducing and stabilizing agent under microwave irradiation. The LSPR for each system was observed by UV-vis spectroscopy. Particle size distribution and zeta potential demonstrate the size and stability for these nanoparticles. FESEM and TEM microscopies have shown the size and morphology of these systems correlated with UV-vis, particle size distribution, and zeta potential analyses. The study demonstrates a rapid, facile, cheaper, and one-step green method of synthesis for these metallic nanoparticles being an alternative to the conventional methods used for synthesis of metallic nanoparticles.},

The incorporation of CNTs in a concentration of 5% and 10% of total weight of the nanocomposite and their impact on both structural and biological properties were studied by using a set of standard complementary biological, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques. The characteristic peaks of carbon structure in CNTs were not observed in the CNTs-HAp composites by X-ray diffraction analysis. Moreover, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies confirmed the presence of HAp as the main phase of the synthesized CNTs:HAp nanocomposites. The addition of CNTs considerably affected the nanocomposite morphology by increasing the average crystallite size from 18.7 nm for raw HAp to 28.6 nm for CNTs:HAp-10, confirming their proper incorporation. The biocompatibility evaluation of CNTs:HAp-5 and CNTs:HAp-10 nanocomposites included the assessment of several parameters, such as cell viability, antioxidant response, and lipid peroxidation, on human G-292 osteoblast cell line. Our findings revealed good biocompatibility properties for CNTs:HAp nanocomposites prepared by the coprecipitation method supporting their potential uses in orthopedics and prosthetics.},

abstract = {BackgroundAdvanced atherosclerotic lesions are commonly characterized by the presence of calcification. Several studies indicate that extensive calcification is associated with plaque stability, yet recent studies suggest that calcification morphology and location may adversely affect the mechanical stability of atherosclerotic plaques. The underlying cause of atherosclerotic calcification and the importance of intra-plaque calcium distribution remains poorly understood. MethodThe goal of this study was the characterization of calcification morphology based on histological features in 20 human carotid endarterectomy (CEA) specimens. Representative frozen sections (10µm thick) were cut from the common, bulb, internal and external segments of CEA tissues and stained with von Kossa's reagent for calcium phosphate. The morphology of calcification (calcified patches) and fibrous layer thickness were quantified in 135 histological sections. ResultsIntra-plaque calcification was distributed heterogeneously (calcification %-area: bulb segment: 14.2 2.1%; internal segment: 12.9 2.8%; common segment: 4.6 1.1%; p=0.001). Calcified patches were found in 20 CEAs (patch size: &lt;0.1mm2 to &gt;1.0mm2). Calcified patches were most abundant in the bulb and least in the common segment (bulb n=7.30 1.08; internal n=4.81 1.17; common n=2.56 0.56; p=0.0007). Calcified patch circularity decreased with increasing size (&lt;0.1mm2: 0.77 0.01, 0.1-1mm2: 0.62 0.01, &gt;1.0mm2: 0.51 0.02; p=0.0001). A reduced fibrous layer thickness was associated with increased calcium patch size (p&lt;0.0001). ConclusionsIn advanced carotid atherosclerosis, calcification appears to be a heterogeneous and dynamic atherosclerotic plaque component, as indicated by the simultaneous presence of few large stabilizing calcified patches and numerous small calcific patches. Future studies are needed to elucidate the associations of intra-plaque calcification size and distribution with atherothrombotic events. Calcification is abundant in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) tissues.Calcification is located predominantly in the bulb/bifurcation segments of CEAs.Histologically determined calcified patch sizes span across 4-orders of magnitude.Morphology of calcified patches changes significantly with patch size.},

abstract = {Cell separation based on size by microfluidic devices has become a widely studied research area to facilitate the diagnosis of malaria and cancer, in particular. Conventional diagnostic systems are sophisticated but expensive; however, with microfluidic devices a broad range of laboratory applications can be accomplished in a hand-held device. In this work, we fabricate a series of devices as Dean force coupled curved mirochannels for separation of human breast cancer cell lines which are MCF-7 (~20 µm) and MD-MBA-231 (~15 µm). These curved channels were fabricated in four different dimensions: 400 µm wide 81 µm high; 500 μm wide 84 μm; 600 μm wide 91 μm high; 700 μm wide 86 μm high. These channels have one inlet and three outlets. Each channel experienced different flow rates to observe cell focusing and separation. The MCF-7 cell line was labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester, which has a fluorescence characteristic, whereas the MDA-MB-231 cell line was unlabeled. Fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed to determine the appropriate flow rates for focusing. The investigation of cell separation yield was performed by flow cytometry. Adjusting flow rates revealed that enrichment of MCF-7 cells requires very high flow rates. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed enrichment to occur at the second outlet of each channel. The efficiency of enrichment was observed in the microchannel with 500 µm width as high as 93 %. Our results suggest that these curved channels can be regarded as a prototype of a microfluidic diagnostic device due to their fast reaction time, relatively accurate results, low cost and miniaturized features.},

The effect on cell viability of the fungus was evaluated using the XTT technique and morphometric analysis by image processing. SEM and DLS analysis indicated that spherical particles with larger diameters for CS-EO biocomposites were observed. Zeta potential values were higher (+11.1 ± 1.60 mV) for CS nanoparticles. Results suggest a chemical interaction between chitosan and pepper tree essential oil. The highest concentration of CS-EO complex caused a larger (40-50%) decrease in A. parasiticus viability. The inclusion of pepper tree oil in CS nanoparticles is a feasible alternative to obtain antifungal biocomposites, where the activity that each compound presents individually is strengthened.},

Moreover, the morphology of the CuNPs@NCC was investigated using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), which showed well-dispersed CuNPs with an average particle size less than 4 nm and the shape of CuNPs was found to be spherical. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) also confirmed the presence of CuNPs on the NCC.

abstract = {Polypyrrole (PPY) powder was chemically synthesized using ferric chloride (FeCl3) and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Le Bail Method, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). XRD pattern showed a broad scattering of a semicrystalline structure composed of main broad peaks centered at 2θ = 11.4°, 22.1°, and 43.3°. Crystallinity percentage was estimated by the ratio between the sums of the peak areas to the area of amorphous broad halo due to the amorphous phase and showed that PPY has around 20 (1)%. FTIR analysis allowed assigning characteristic absorption bands in the structure of PPY. SEM showed micrometric particles of varying sizes with morphologies similar to cauliflower. Crystal data (monoclinic, space group P 21/c, a = 7.1499 (2) \r{A}, b = 13.9470 (2) \r{A}, c = 17.3316 (2) \r{A}, α = 90 \r{A}, β = 61.5640 (2) \r{A} and γ = 90 \r{A}) were obtained using the FullProf package program under the conditions of the method proposed by Le Bail. Molecular relaxation was performed using the density functional theory (DFT) and suggests that tetramer polymer chains are arranged along the "c" direction. Average crystallite size was found in the range of 20 (1) \r{A}. A value of 9.33 \texttimes{} 10-9 S/cm was found for PPY conductivity.},

abstract = {The ZnO microrods were fabricated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by using a high-temperature hydrothermal method. The main goal is to investigate the correlation between synthesis temperature and characteristics of ZnO microrods. The morphology of ZnO microrods was investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), the optical properties were measured by photoluminescence (PL), and the crystallinity was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). SEM images show that morphology of ZnO is rod-like. The growth mechanism is explained by Oswald ripening process. The outer surface, length, top-end, and bottom diameter of ZnO microrods, however, vary with the synthesis temperatures. The synthesis temperatures are associated with pH values and the pH value is related to cation concentration in the solution. Thus Zn ion concentration plays an important role in controlling the morphology of microrods. In this study it is found that ZnO microrods grown at 90 C have the best crystallinity and fewer defects with preferred optical properties than other samples. Display Omitted The ZnO microrods were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass by using a high-temperature hydrothermal method.When the synthesis temperature over 170 C, ZnO microrods show the sheet-stacking morphology.XRD patterns and PL spectra show ZnO microrods have few defects when synthesized at temperature of 90 C and 110 C.},

Different nano-materials, including Fe/Ni, diamond, and bentonite nano-particles with different shapes and different electrical conductivity, were used as supporting mediums to form the medium-CNT composites. Those composites were used to print the medium-CNT composite films as emitters and investigate their field emission characteristics. The enhancement effect in the field emission property of the prepared medium-CNT composite films and the theorems to cause the enhancement were investigated by differently analyzed and measured processes. Scanning electron microscope images suggested that the enhancement in the field emission properties of the medium-CNT composite films was caused by the supporting mediums having comparably matching dimensions and suitable shapes. The addition of medium materials could construct a matching structure to decrease the gap's barrier and then to increase the probability of ohmic contact between CNTs and substrates.

For the (In1-xPrx)VO4 (x=0-0.1) system, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns show that all of the peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic phase, and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that there is no obvious difference for the particle morphology between various Pr3+ ions doping. No emission peak characteristics of Pr3+ ions were observed under an excitation of 326nm. In the (In0.97-yLayPr0.03)VO4 (y=0-0.97) system, XRD patterns indicated that the crystal structure changed from the orthorhombic InVO4 structure to the monoclinic LaVO4 structure when the In3+ ions were gradually substituted by the La3+ ions. The location of excitation peaks shifted to short wavelength area (blue shift), and the characteristic f-f transition of Pr3+ ion was observed. With increasing La3+ ion concentration, a series of emission peaks assigned to the 3P0 3H4,5,6, 1D2 3H4, and 3P0 3F2 characteristic transitions of Pr3+ ion were observed in the emission spectra under an excitation of 315nm, and this indicated that the La3+ ion can act as a sensitizer for the (In0.97-yLayPr0.03)VO4 phosphor.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new method, based on a graph searching technique, for microcrack extraction from scanning electron microscopic images of rocks. This method mainly focuses on how to detect the crack and extract it, and then quantify some basic geometrical features. The crack can be detected automatically with the aid of two endpoints of the crack. The algorithm involves the following process: the A* graph searching technique is first used to find a path throughout the crack region, defined by the initial two endpoints; the pixels of the path will be used as the seeds for the region growing method to restore the primary crack area; then, an automatic filling holes' operation is used to remove the possible holes in the region growing result; the medial axis and distance transformation of the crack area are acquired, and then the final crack is rebuilt by painting disks along a medial axis without branches. The crack result is separated without interaction. In the remaining parts, the crack features are quantified, such as the length, width, angle and area, and error analysis shows that the error percentage of the proposed approach reduces to a low level with actual width increases, and results of some example images are illustrated. The algorithm is efficient and can also be used for image detection of other linear structural objects.

abstract = {The multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) is developed in the vein of the
Crouzeix--Raviart element for solving viscous incompressible flows in genuine
heterogeneous media. Such flows are relevant in many branches of engineering,
often at multiple scales and at regions where analytical representations of the
microscopic features of the flows are often unavailable. Full accounts of these
problems heavily depend on the geometry of the system under consideration and
are computationally expensive. Therefore, a method capable of solving multiscale
features of the flow without confining itself to fine scale calculations is
sought.
The approximation of boundary condition on coarse element edges when computing
the multiscale basis functions critically influences the eventual accuracy of
any MsFEM approaches. The weakly enforced continuity of Crouzeix--Raviart
function space across element edges leads to a natural boundary condition for
the multiscale basis functions which relaxes the sensitivity of our method to
complex patterns of obstacles exempt from the need to implement any oversampling
techniques. Additionally, the application of a penalization method makes it
possible to avoid a complex unstructured domain and allows extensive use of
simpler Cartesian meshes.},

abstract = {Accurate imaging of minerals in petrographic thin sections using (semi)-automatic image segmentation techniques remains a challenging task chiefly due to the optical similarity of adjacent grains or grain aggregates rendering definition of grain boundaries difficult. We present a new semi-automatic image segmentation workflow for the quantitative analysis of microscopic grain fabrics. The workflow uses an automated seeded region growing algorithm, which is based on variance analysis of five or more RGB images. The workflow is implemented in the open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses). SAGA provides all required tools for image analysis and geographic referencing. It also features a graphical user interface that allows the user to simultaneously display and link multiple images and, thus, facilitates manual post-processing of the images. SAGA's capabilities for vector data analysis offer instant calculation and visualization of the compiled geometric database within a GIS environment. Specifically, grain contacts are automatically identified by lines of intersection and manually classified by contact type to characterize the mineral fabric of petrographic thin sections. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the workflow, 39 transmitted light images of 13 weathered sandstone samples of the Buntsandstein Formation in northwestern Germany were analyzed. Based on the segmentation results obtained from the samples, a number of parameters, including modal composition, geometry of grain contacts, porosity, and grain size distribution were determined and statistically evaluated. The results of the image analysis are utilized to assess the weathering susceptibility of the sandstone samples and point to the importance of cementation determining the geotechnical properties of a given sandstone sample.

abstract = {A new computationally efficient nonlinear model of fluid saturated porous media.Two-scale modelling of the Biot-Darcy continuum based on the homogenization.Deformation-dependent coefficients are computed using the sensitivity analysis.Nonlinear effects captured without any need to update local microstructures.Nonlinearity is pronounced especially for complex geometries of pores. Homogenization of heterogeneous media with nonlinear effects leads to computationally complex problems requiring updating local microstructures and solving local auxiliary problems to compute characteristic responses. In this paper we suggest how to circumvent such a computationally expensive updating procedure while using an efficient approximation scheme for the local homogenized coefficients, so that the complexity of the whole two-scale modeling is reduced substantially. We consider the deforming porous fluid saturated media described by the Biot model. The proposed modeling approaches are based on the homogenization of the quasistatic fluid-structure interaction whereby differentiation with respect to the microstructure deformation is used as a tool for linearization. Assuming the linear kinematics framework, the physical nonlinearity in the Biot continuum is introduced in terms of the deformation-dependent material coefficients which are approximated as linear functions of the macroscopic response. These functions are obtained by the sensitivity analysis of the homogenized coefficients computed for a given geometry of the porous structure which transforms due to the local deformation. The deformation-dependent material coefficients approximated in this way do not require any solving of local microscopic problems for updated configurations. It appears that difference between the linear and nonlinear models depends significantly on the specific microstructure of the porous medium; this observation is supported by numerical examples.},

abstract = {A novel colon cancer detection and grading system has been proposed.The system exploits structural variation among various colon tissue types.The system mathematically quantifies the variation in terms of some novel features.The shape of lumen is the most discriminating factor among different tissue types.RBF kernel of SVM shows promising results for classification of colon cancer data. The histopathological examination of tissue specimens is necessary for the diagnosis and grading of colon cancer. However, the process is subjective and leads to significant inter/intra observer variation in diagnosis as it mainly relies on the visual assessment of histopathologists. Therefore, a reliable computer-aided technique, which can automatically classify normal and malignant colon samples, and determine grades of malignant samples, is required. In this paper, we propose a novel colon cancer diagnostic (CCD) system, which initially classifies colon biopsy images into normal and malignant classes, and then automatically determines the grades of colon cancer for malignant images. To this end, various novel structural descriptors, which mathematically model and quantify the variation among the structure of normal colon tissues and malignant tissues of various cancer grades, have been employed. Radial basis function (RBF) kernel of support vector machines (SVM) has been employed as classifier in order to classify/grade colon samples based on these descriptors. The proposed system has been tested on 92 malignant and 82 normal colon biopsy images. The classification performance has been measured in terms of various performance measures, and quite promising performance has been observed. Compared with previous techniques, the proposed system has demonstrated better cancer detection (classification accuracy=95.40%) and grading (classification accuracy=93.47%) capability. Therefore, the proposed CCD system can provide a reliable second opinion to the histopathologists.},

Tunable feature of quantum effect related to the configuration, dimension as well as the density of nanoparticles makes them appropriate building blocks for their applications at the nano-scale. In this paper, we systematically investigate the fabrication of self-assembled Au nanoparticles on high-index type-B GaAs (n11), where n is 9, 8, 4, and 2. By means of varying annealing temperature, Au deposition amount and annealing duration, the evolution of Au nanoparticles in terms of the average height, lateral diameter and average density is systematically studied. We observe that the variation of annealing temperature leads to an abrupt configuration evolution from the wiggly Au nanostructures to the round-dome shaped nanoparticles due to the limited and/or enhanced surface diffusion at various temperatures. Meanwhile, the variation of deposition amount leads to a wide range of dimensions of Au nanoparticles as a result of the size increase and the corresponding density decrease. Furthermore, based on the annealing duration control, the size of Au nanoparticles tends to be gradually increased owing to the Ostwald-ripening. Meanwhile, the effect of surface index on the size and density is also witnessed. The results are systematically analyzed by using the atomic force microscope images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectra and maps, Fourier filter transforms power spectra, cross-sectional line-profiles and size and density plots.},

CdS film is chosen as the photosensitive layer since its excellent photoconductive property, low cost and suitable for depositing on different type substrates with large areas. In the present study, CdS films are deposited on silicon substrates by using rf magnetron sputtering at room temperature. After that, the prepared CdS films were annealed at different temperatures for 50 min in N2 ambient and a rigorous analysis was presented on the surface topography, and photoconductive properties by scanning electron microscopy and semiconductor characteristics analyzer. The test results shows that the film annealed at 400 °C has the best photoconductive property. Moreover, the finite-element method was used to study the relationship between the Aluminium (Al) electrode shape and the linearity of PSD. Three different type PSDs (quadrilateral, rectangular-shaped and pillow-shaped) were designed and simulated. The simulation results indicate that the quadrilateral electrode is suitable for large-area PSDs, whereas the rectangular-shaped and pillow-shaped electrodes can be used to realize small-area PSDs. The measurement results shows that the non-linearities of three type PSDs with dimensions of 10 10 mm are respectively 2.106, 3.594, and 3.55 %, which verify the conclusion deduced from the simulation results.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates a high-throughput fabrication method of gallium nitride (GaN) nanowire (NW) and sub-micron wire (SMW) arrays using a combination of projection lithography, plasma etching, and post-plasma wet etching techniques. Photoluminescence (PL), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and I-V measurements were used to characterize the GaN NW/SMW devices. These NWs/SMWs can be used to create highly-sensitive and selective conductometric chemical/bio-sensors.The length and width of the wires can be precisely customized. The length of the NW/SMW varied from 5µm to 5mm and the width ranges from 100nm to 500nm. Such comprehensive control in the geometry of a wire is difficult to achieve with other fabrication methods. The post-plasma KOH wet etching greatly reduces the surface roughness of the GaN NW/SMW as well as the performance of devices. Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices can be incorporated with GaN NW/SMW arrays on a single chip using this top-down fabrication method. In this paper, we describe a top-down method for the manufacture of horizontal aligned nanowire arrays for potential application to UV detector, chemical/gas/biology sensors. An illustration of the alignment-free nanowire is shown below:Display OmittedThis is a SEM image ( 600 magnification) of the longest total length (5000µm) nanowire in serpentine shape. A total number of 81 NWs like this one are on a single die. We disclose a top-down approach to the fabrication horizontal aligned single/multiple nanowire structure.We provide data on the quality of our nanowires.We present the UV response and possible applications (chemical/gas/biology sensors) of the nanowire array.},

We have used replica molding and large-range atomic force microscopy to characterize the three-dimensional shape of high aspect ratio microstructures. Casting inverted replicas of microstructures using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) circumvents the inability of AFM probes to measure deep and narrow cavities. We investigated cylindrical deep reactive ion etched cavities in silicon wafers and determined the radius of curvature (ROC) of the sidewalls as a function of depth. Statistical analysis verified the reliability and reproducibility of the replication procedure. The mean ROC was determined as (6.32 0.06)µm, i.e., with 1% accuracy, while the ROC linearly increases by (0.52 0.03)µm from the top to the bottom of the sidewalls. Nanometer sized surface defects are also well replicated. In addition, the method allows combining multiple features from differently processed wafers into a single sample, accelerating characterization in process optimization tasks. To access the sidewall shape samples needed to be cleaved. The method was applied to study X-ray refractive optics, whose performance is crucially affected by their three dimensional shapes.},

abstract = {Tumors are heterogeneous tissues consisting of multiple regions with distinct characteristics. Characterization of these intra-tumor regions can improve patient diagnosis and enable a better targeted treatment. Ideally, tissue characterization could be performed non-invasively, using medical imaging data, to derive per voxel a number of features, indicative of tissue properties. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of this imaging-derived feature space is prohibiting for easy exploration and analysis - especially when clinical researchers require to associate observations from the feature space to other reference data, e.g., features derived from histopathological data. Currently, the exploratory approach used in clinical research consists of juxtaposing these data, visually comparing them and mentally reconstructing their relationships. This is a time consuming and tedious process, from which it is difficult to obtain the required insight. We propose a visual tool for: 1 easy exploration and visual analysis of the feature space of imaging-derived tissue characteristics and 2 knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation and confirmation, with respect to reference data used in clinical research. We employ, as central view, a 2D embedding of the imaging-derived features. Multiple linked interactive views provide functionality for the exploration and analysis of the local structure of the feature space, enabling linking to patient anatomy and clinical reference data. We performed an initial evaluation with ten clinical researchers. All participants agreed that, unlike current practice, the proposed visual tool enables them to identify, explore and analyze heterogeneous intra-tumor regions and particularly, to generate and confirm hypotheses, with respect to clinical reference data.},

abstract = {HighlightsA framework for basal cell carcinoma detection based on unsupervised feature learning.Experimental results show an improvement when compared to state-of-the-art methods.The framework integrates a digital staining method which improves interpretability.Digital staining highlights regions in the image which the model relates to cancer. ObjectiveThe paper addresses the problem of automatic detection of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in histopathology images. In particular, it proposes a framework to both, learn the image representation in an unsupervised way and visualize discriminative features supported by the learned model. Materials and methodsThis paper presents an integrated unsupervised feature learning (UFL) framework for histopathology image analysis that comprises three main stages: (1) local (patch) representation learning using different strategies (sparse autoencoders, reconstruct independent component analysis and topographic independent component analysis (TICA), (2) global (image) representation learning using a bag-of-features representation or a convolutional neural network, and (3) a visual interpretation layer to highlight the most discriminant regions detected by the model. The integrated unsupervised feature learning framework was exhaustively evaluated in a histopathology image dataset for BCC diagnosis. ResultsThe experimental evaluation produced a classification performance of 98.1%, in terms of the area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve, for the proposed framework outperforming by 7% the state-of-the-art discrete cosine transform patch-based representation. ConclusionsThe proposed UFL-representation-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for BCC detection. Thanks to its visual interpretation layer, the method is able to highlight discriminative tissue regions providing a better diagnosis support. Among the different UFL strategies tested, TICA-learned features exhibited the best performance thanks to its ability to capture low-level invariances, which are inherent to the nature of the problem.},

Crystalline LiFePO4/C and co-doped LiFe1-x-yNixCoyPO4/C (x=0.00-0.04; y=0.00-0.04) nano-composite phases were synthesized by a simple high-temperature solid-state method. Structural characterization of samples conducted through X-ray diffraction, indicates highly crystallized olivine-related structure. Moreover, it implies that the Ni and Co co-doping on one side does not weaken the olivine structure of LiFePO4 and on the other side can further stabilize the crystal structure. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) applied as morphological evaluation tool and depicted uniform grain distribution, smooth particles surface, and particles within nanometre range dimensions. Electrochemical performance characterization of the samples conducted by charge/discharge tests, illustrated that the Ni and Co co-doping improves cycling and high-rate capability of the LiFePO4/C. Especially, the LiFe0.98Ni0.01Co0.01PO4/C showed the best cycle stability and rate capability among all of the samples, reaching 93% of theoretical discharge capacity (~170mAh/g). Thereby, excellent cycle performance and capacity retention through wide discharge rates (C/10-10C) would make this cathode material a promising candidate for large-scale Li-ion/Polymer battery applications; such as PHEV, EV, grid storage and other energy storage systems.},

abstract = {The challenge of fabricating geometries with critical dimensions ranging from few microns down to 10 nm with high production rate is delaying the development of nanotechnology based products. Diverse research works have shown the capability of technologies such as UV lithography, nano imprint lithography and e-beam lithography to produce micro and nano features. However, their application for tooling purposes is relatively new and the potential to produce nanometer features with high volume and low cost is enormous. Considering possible implementation in a mass production environment the precision of measuring results and the accuracy of measurement relocation are very relevant. In this paper, the capability of producing with high volume Lab-on-chip devices through injection molding is evaluated. Preparation of master geometries was made in a Si wafer using e-beam lithography and reactive ion etching. Subsequent nickel electroplating was employed to replicate the obtained geometries on the tool, which was used to mold on transparent polymer substrates the functional structures. To assess the critical factors affecting the replication quality throughout the different steps of the proposed process chain, test geometries were designed and produced on the side of the functional features. The so-called "Finger Print" of the lithography and molding processes was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated through scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy respectively. The entire process chain is therefore characterized and the degree of replication among the different replication steps quantified with precise measurements using a high accuracy relocation technique on the produced key test geometries. Influence of injection molding process parameters, feature dimensions and orientation relative to the polymer flow direction have been assessed in respect of the replication fidelity of the produced micro/sub-μm channels. Finally the paper addresses product compliance with specifications, focusing on tolerances of vertical dimensions using a metrological approach: sub-μm features on silicon, nickel stampers and injection molded substrates are measured. Results of measurement uncertainty calculation, quantitative replication fidelity assessment, and dimensional tolerances at the nanometer scale verification are reported.},

The addition of titania to MWCNTs has the potential to provide new capability for the development of electrical devices by taking advantage of the favorable electric characteristics of MWCNTs. MWCNTs were first functionalized with carboxyl, acyl chloride, amine, and hydroxyl groups and were then dispersed in a tetraisopropyl titanate (TIPT) solution via ultrasonic processing. After gelation, well-dispersed titania in the MWCNT/titania nanocomposites was obtained. Functionalized MWCNTs with varied functional groups were proved by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). For the nanocomposites, the degree of the sol-gel process were proved by Raman spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Furthermore, the morphology of the MWCNT/titania nanocomposites was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the sol-gel process, the functionalized MWCNTs with carboxyl, acyl chloride, amine, and hydroxyl groups have resulted in the carbon nanotube-graft-titania nanocomposites with a network structure of titania between the carbon nanotubes.},

The resultant AuNPs/IP6 were subject to characterization including UV/Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that AuNPs with 65 µM of IP6 would result in a core AuNPs-shell (IP6 layer) structure, which exhibited the strongest SERS signal, due to the "hot spot effect" generated from the 1-2 nm interparticle gaps of AuNPs/IP6 nanohybrids (ionic interaction of IP6 and Au+). Furthermore, the reaction kinetics of Au and IP6 were also investigated in this work. Higher concentration of IP6 (190 and 260 µM) will make AuNPs become irregularly shaped, because IP6 is a basic salt and served as a pH mediator. The morphology and distribution of AuNPs were greatly improved by addition of 65 µM of IP6. This novel AuNPs/IP6 nanohybrid showed great stability and Raman enhancement. It is promising in the application of rapid and label-free biological detection of bacteria or tumor cells.},

With this aim, nanorods (NRs) and nanocubes (NCs) of barium titanate (BaTiO3) have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal route at temperature as low as 408 K, employing barium acetate, titanium isopropoxide, and sodium hydroxide as reagents without any surfactant or template. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), used for the morphology and structure analyses, showed that the NRs were formed by an oriented attachment of the NCs building-blocks with 20 nm average crystallites size. The thermodynamic properties represented by the relative partial molar free energies, enthalpies, and entropies of the oxygen dissolution in the perovskite phase, as well as the equilibrium partial pressure of oxygen, indicated that NRs powders have lower oxygen vacancies concentration than the NCs. This NRs characteristic, together with higher tetragonallity of the structure, leads to the enhancement of the dielectric properties of BaTiO3 ceramics. The results presented in this work show indubitably the importance of the nanopowders morphology on the material properties.},

Morphology of phase-separated structure, including domain size and height, could be controlled by varying total concentration of the blended solution, and various nanoscale features such as island-like and hole-like structures were achieved by changing weight ratio of the two immiscible polymers.},

Cotton fabrics containing nanometal oxides were prepared via a thiol-modification of cotton fabric samples and then dipped into the metal salt solutions precursors and transferred to the microwave oven. The surface morphology and quantitative analysis of the obtained modified cotton fabrics containing nanometal oxides were studied by scanning electron microscopy coupled with high energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX). The shape and distribution of nanometal oxide inside the fabric samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy of cross-section fabric samples. The iron oxide nanoparticles had a nanosphere with particle size diameter 15-20 nm, copper oxide nanoparticles had a nanosphere with particle size diameter 25-30 nm, and cobalt oxide nanoparticles had a nanotube-like shape with a length of 100-150 nanometer and a diameter of ∼58 nanometer, whereas the manganese oxide nanoparticles had a linear structure forming nanorods with a diameter of 50-55 nanometer and a length of 70-80 nanometers. Antibacterial activity was evaluated quantitatively against grampositive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, UV-protection activity was analyzed using UV-DRS spectroscopy, and flame retardation of prepared fabric samples was evaluated according to the limiting oxygen index (LOI). Results revealed that the prepared fabric sample containing nanometal oxide possesses improved antibacterial, LOI, and UV-absorbing efficiency. Moreover, the metal oxide nanoparticles did not leach out the fabrics by washing even after 30 laundering washing cycles.},

abstract = {Dioscorea bulbifera is a potent medicinal plant used in both Indian and Chinese traditional medicine owing to its rich phytochemical diversity. Herein, we report the rapid synthesis of novel AucoreAgshell nanoparticles by D. bulbifera tuber extract (DBTE). AucoreAgshell NPs synthesis was completed within 5 h showing a prominent peak at 540 nm. HRTEM analysis revealed 9 nm inner core of elemental gold covered by a silver shell giving a total particle diameter upto 15 nm. AucoreAgshellNPs were comprised of 57.34 ± 1.01% gold and 42.66 ± 0.97% silver of the total mass. AucoreAgshellNPs showed highest biofilm inhibition upto 83.68 ± 0.09% against A. baumannii. Biofilms of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus were inhibited up to 18.93 ± 1.94%, 22.33 ± 0.56%, and 30.70 ± 1.33%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed unregulated cellular efflux through pore formation leading to cell death. Potent antileishmanial activity of AucoreAgshellNPs (MIC = 32 µg/mL) was confirmed by MTT assay. Further SEM micrographs showed pronounced deformity in the spindle shaped cellular morphology changing to spherical. This is the first report of synthesis, characterization, antibiofilm, and antileishmanial activity of AucoreAgshellNPs synthesized by D. bulbifera.},

abstract = {We present grafting of polycarboxyphenyl polymer on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) via a free radical polymerization and subsequent anchoring of the metal oxide nanoparticles for the evaluation of their potential applicability to supercapacitor electrodes. Here, metal oxide nanoparticles, Fe3O4 and Sm2O3, were created after the oxidation of metal precursors Sm(NO3)3 and FeCl2, respectively, and attached on the surface of polycarboxyphenyl-grafted MWCNT (P-CNT) in aqueous medium. This approach shows a potential for enhancing the dispersion of Fe3O4 and Sm2O3 nanoparticles on the wall of P-CNT. The structure and morphological characteristics of the purified MWCNT, P-CNT, and metal oxide-anchored polycarboxyphenyl-grafted MWCNT (MP-CNT) nanocomposites were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The electrochemical performance of the purified MWCNT electrode, P-CNT electrode, and MP-CNT electrodes was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge in a 1.0 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The results showed that the specific capacitance of the purified MWCNT was 45.3 F/g at the scan rate of 5mV/s and increased to 54.1 F/g after the modification with polycarboxyphenyl polymer. Further modification of P-CNT with Sm2O3 and Fe3O4 improved the specific capacitance of 65.84 F/g and 173.38 F/g, respectively, at the same scan rate.},

The nanocomposite object underwent two thermal treatments to stabilize and crystallize the TiO2. The morphology of the nanocomposite object was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The TiO2 nanotanks obtained have cylindrical shapes and are approximately 69 nm in diameter with a tank-to-tank distance of 26 nm. X-ray diffraction analyses performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were used to investigate the TiO2 structure. The optical properties were studied using UV-Vis spectroscopy.},

abstract = {The aim was to evaluate the remineralizing efficacy of fluorohydroxyapatite (FHA) gel on artificial dentinal caries lesion in vitro. Artificial carious lesions were made on occlusal cavities of teeth by exposing the dentin surface to a demineralizing solution. Each cavity was capped with a 3mm thick FHA gel for 4 weeks. After the FHA gel was removed, the surface morphology and structure of the dentin were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The dentin mineral density (DMD) was measured by micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT). A layer of dense and orderly hexagonal crystal structure, with average diameter of 1 µm and thickness of 4-5 µm, could be observed on dentin surface. These crystals exhibited elemental peaks for calcium, phosphorus, carbon, and oxygen and characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite (HA) and fluorapatite (FA) via XRD and FT-IR.The DMD of dentin surface layer significantly increased after it was capped with FHA gel (p &lt; 0.05). In the present study, the FHA gel could rapidly construct apatite on the artificial dentin caries surface and significantly increase the mineral density, which suggests that FHA gel might be a proper IPT material with remineralizing function.},

In this study, a spherically-shaped CS-SP nanoparticle was synthesized and characterized. The ability of the nanoparticle to protect DNA from enzymatic degradation, its thermostability and cytotoxicity were evaluated. The particle size was found below 100 nmas determined by Zetasizer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and field scanning electron microscopy (FSEM) results. The surface charge ranges from 43.7 mV to 38.5 mV before and after encapsulation with DNA plasmid, respectively. In terms of thermostability, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) revealed that CS-SP nanoparticle had a melting temperature of 110 °C, with rapid decomposition occurring at 120 °C. Encapsulation of DNA with the synthesized nanoparticle was evidenced by changes in the FTIR spectra including characteristic peaks at 3267.39 and 1635.58 cm-1, wave numbers. Additional peak was also observed at 1169.7 cm-1 following encapsulation. Electrophoretic mobility showed that CS-SP nanoparticle protected plasmid DNA from enzymatic degradation, while cell viability assays confirmed that the synthesized nanoparticle exhibited low cytotoxicity at different concentrations in avian cells. Taken together these, CS-SP nanoparticle showed potentials for applications as a DNA delivery system.},

The precursor material was dried at 200°C and calcined at 600°C. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were employed to verify the existence of crystal phases (P42/mnm) and the morphology of this trirutile-type CoSb2O6 oxide. Pyramidal and cubic shaped crystals (average size: 41.1 nm), embedded in the material's surface, were identified. Mesopores (average size: 6.5 nm) on the nanoparticles' surface were observed by means of transmission electron microscopy. The best sensitivity of the CoSb2O6 in a CO atmospherewas at the relatively low temperatures of 250 and 350°C, whereas, in a C3H8 atmosphere, the sensitivity increased uniformly with temperature. These results encourage using the CoSb2O6 nanoparticles as gas sensors.},

The effect of the ultrasonic system on the stability and thermal diffusivity of the nanofluids was investigated. Thermal diffusivity measurements were conducted using a photopyroelectric technique. The dispersion characteristics and morphology of the nanoparticles, as well as the optical absorption properties of the nanofluids, were studied using photon cross correlation spectroscopy with a Nanophox analyzer, transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. At higher particle concentration, there was greater enhancement of the thermal diffusivity of the nanofluids resulting from sonication. Moreover, greater stability and enhancement of thermal diffusivity were obtained by sonicating the nanofluids with the higher power probe sonicator prior to measurement.},

Precursor suspensions of PEG-DA, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone, and SiO2 or Al2O3 nanoparticles were prepared. The precursor suspension flows through a microfluidic device mounted on an upright microscope and is polymerized in an automated process. A patterned photomask with transparent geometric features masks UV light to synthesize the particles. Composite particles with vias were synthesized and corresponding inorganic SiO2 and Al2O3 particles were obtained through polymer burn-off and sintering of the composites. The synthesis of porous inorganic particles of SiO2 and Al2O3 with vias and overall dimensions in the range of ∼35-90 µm was achieved. BET specific surface area measurements for single via inorganic particles were 56-69m2/g for SiO2 particles and 73-81m2/g for Al2O3 particles. Surface areas as high as 114m2/g were measured formultivia cubic SiO2 particles. The findings suggest that, with optimization, the particles should have applications in areas where high surface area is important such as catalysis and sieving.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to introduce an image source-independent automated method for segmentation and classification of prostate glands. This research focuses on light microscopic images of the samples from different laboratories using the same staining method. Color information in the image is highly dependent on the source and the conditions under which the image has been taken. The proposed method can be used to analyze images with color variations. Color information is used for the segmentation of tissue structures and Delaunay triangulation is used for gland segmentation. The proposed method uses triangulation to find the basic structure of any shaped and sized gland and to prevent misclassification of gland components. The proposed approach classifies the nuclei circumscribing the glands to single and multilayered. Other features used in the classification are the amount of nuclei and the area of the gland. The number of layers can be used for determining the malignancy of the tissue sample. In most cases, a single-layered gland is malignant and multilayered is benign. This segmentation approach is different than what has been previously used in the literature. In this paper, the glands are classified to four different categories: single layered, multilayered, rejected or nonclassified. This approach distinguishes majority of single and multilayered glands from each other.},

abstract = {In this research, the stainless steel sheet (EN-1.4301) is selected to investigate the adhesive interaction of the RBC to the textured and non-textured surfaces. The sheet sample is equally divided into two sides, one is textured with pillar patterns and the other side remains non-textured as conventionally finished surface (smooth surface). The pillar patterns were fabricated by laser surface texturing (LST) technology with a picosecond laser. Atomic force microscopic (AFM) single-cell indentation tests are performed on the RBC to the counter-surfaces. Based on the experimental results, Force-Piezo Displacement curves under all three press distances (30, 50, 80%) of the RBC thickness, show strong adhesion signals of the RBC to pillar textured stainless steel surface. Compared to non-textured stainless steel surface, such adhesive behavior is not observed. From the perspective of contact mechanics, these phenomena can be explained based on the change of bending energy, interaction energy and surface contact area of cell membrane due to the micro-deformations among the contact regions of the RBC and pillar patterns. These findings expand our understanding of RBC adhesive behavior (possibly to all cell types) to the micro-textured counter-surface.},

However, its synthesis is not optimized yet. In this study, it was elaborated using an ultrafast synthesis protocol: Hydro-Micromechanical Synthesis. Two other synthesis methods, Hydrochemical Synthesis and Hydrothermal Synthesis, were used for comparison. In all cases, the as-synthesized samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and LASER diffraction particle size analysis. Rietveld method was used to refine various structural parameters and obtain an average crystallite size, on a Hydro-Micromechanical submicronic sample. X-ray single crystal structure determination was performed on a crystal obtained by Hydrochemical Synthesis. It has been shown that regardless of the synthesis protocol, the prepared samples always crystallize in the same crystal lattice, with P21/c space group and only differ from their macroscopic textural parameters. Nevertheless, only the Hydro-Micromechanical method is industrially scalable and enables a precise control of the textural parameters of the obtained calcium zincate.},

abstract = {Stain in-homogeneity adversely affects segmentation and quantification of tissues in histology images. Stain normalisation techniques have been used to standardise the appearance of images. However, most the available stain normalisation techniques only work on a particular kind of stain images. In addition, some of these techniques fail to utilise both the spatial and textural information in histology images, leading to image tissue distortion. In this paper, a hybrid approach has been developed, based on an octree colour quantisation algorithm combined with the Beer-Lambert law, a modified blind source separation algorithm, and a modified colour transfer approach. The hybrid method consists of two stages the stain separation stage and colour transfer stage. An octree colour quantisation algorithm combined with Beer-Lambert law, and a modified blind source separation algorithm are used during the stain separation stage to computationally estimate the amount of stain in an histology image based on its chromatic and luminous response. A modified colour transfer algorithm is used during the colour transfer stage to minimise the effect of varying staining and illumination. The hybrid method addresses the colour variation problem in both H&amp;DAB (Haemotoxylin and Diaminobenzidine) and H&amp;E (Haemotoxylin and Eosin) stain images. The stain normalisation method is validated against ground truth data. It is widely known that the Beer-Lambert law applies to only stains (such as haematoxylin, eosin) that absorb light. We demonstrate that the Beer-Lambert law applies is applicable to images containing a DAB stain. Better stain normalisation results are obtained in both H&amp;E and H&amp;DAB images.},

abstract = {Image-based classification of histology sections, in terms of distinct components (e.g., tumor, stroma, normal), provides a series of indices for histology composition (e.g., the percentage of each distinct components in histology sections), and enables the study of nuclear properties within each component. Furthermore, the study of these indices, constructed from each whole slide image in a large cohort, has the potential to provide predictive models of clinical outcome. For example, correlations can be established between the constructed indices and the patients' survival information at cohort level, which is a fundamental step towards personalized medicine. However, performance of the existing techniques is hindered as a result of large technical variations (e.g., variations of color/textures in tissue images due to non-standard experimental protocols) and biological heterogeneities (e.g., cell type, cell state) that are always present in a large cohort. We propose a system that automatically learns a series of dictionary elements for representing the underlying spatial distribution using stacked predictive sparse decomposition. The learned representation is then fed into the spatial pyramid matching framework with a linear support vector machine classifier. The system has been evaluated for classification of distinct histological components for two cohorts of tumor types. Throughput has been increased by using of graphical processing unit (GPU), and evaluation indicates a superior performance results, compared with previous research.},

abstract = {We extend the embedded unit cell (EUC) homogenization approach, to efficiently and accurately capture the multiscale solution of a solid with localized domains undergoing plastic yielding. The EUC approach is based on a mathematical homogenization formulation with non-periodic domains, in which the macroscopic and microscopic domain are concurrently coupled. The formulation consists of a theoretical derivation and the development of special boundary conditions representing the variations of the local displacement field across the unit cell boundaries. In particular, we introduce a restraining band surrounding the local domain in order to support the consistency of the solution in the transition layer between the micro and macro scales. The method is neither limited to a specific plasticity model nor to the number of localized features, thereby providing great flexibility in modeling. Several numerical examples illustrate that the proposed approach is accurate compared with direct finite element simulations, yet requires less computational cost.},

abstract = {The effects of adding ethanol on the macroscopic and microscopic spray characteristics of biodiesel were investigated by experimental and numerical methods. The spray tip penetration (STP) was recorded with a high-speed camera system, while the statistical size distribution of atomized droplets and the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) were obtained using a Malvern laser particle size analyzer. The spray calculation models were established with Fluent software, and the calculation results were validated by the experimental results. Then the numerical simulation of the spray characteristics for diesel, biodiesel, and biodiesel–ethanol fuel blends were conducted. The results showed that the farther the distance is from the nozzle exit, the lower the concentration and the velocity of atomized droplets. The concentration and the velocity of atomized droplets gradually decrease along the radial direction, extending from the center to the periphery. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) at the front and rear of the spray is relatively lower, while the TKE is higher in the middle of the spray, and turbulent vortices appear on both sides of the axial spray center. In addition, the spray characteristics of the different fuels revealed that compared to diesel, the STP and SMD of biodiesel increase by 33.59% and 33.08% on average, respectively. The maximum concentration of biodiesel is higher than that of diesel, and the concentration distribution is more concentrated. The droplet velocity and TKE of biodiesel respectively decrease by 7.38% and 14.49% in comparison to diesel. When ethanol was added to biodiesel by a volume percentage of 30%, the STP and SMD of biodiesel–ethanol fuel blends reduce by 22.05% and 20.88%, respectively. The concentration distribution, the velocity distribution, and the TKE distribution of the fuel blends are similar to that of diesel. This indicates that adding 30% ethanol to biodiesel can effectively improve its spray quality.},

abstract = {Nowadays, human activity recognition is becoming a more and more significant topic, and there is also a wide range of applications for it in real world scenarios. Sensor data is an important data source in engineering and application. At present, some studies have been carried out in the field of human activity recognition based on sensor data in a macroscopic perspective. However, many studies in this perspective face some limitations. One pivotal limitation is uncontrollable data segment length of different kinds of activities. Suitable feature and data form are also influencing factors. This paper carries out the study creatively on a microscopic perspective with an emphasis on the logic and relevance between data segments, attempting to apply the idea of natural language processing and the method of data symbolization to the study of human activity recognition and try to solve the problem above. In this paper, several activity-element definitions and three algorithms are proposed, including the algorithm of dictionary building, the algorithm of corpus building, and activity recognition algorithm improved from a natural language analysis method, TF-IDF. Numerous experiments on different aspects of this model are taken. The experiments are carried out on six complex and representative single-level sensor datasets, namely UCI Sports and Daily dataset, Skoda dataset, WISDM Phoneacc dataset, WISDM Watchacc dataset, Healthy Older People dataset and HAPT dataset, which prove that this model can be applied to different datasets and achieve a satisfactory recognition result.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach that allows to extend the Huxley’57 muscle contraction model equations to incorporate this variation. This extension is built in a thermodynamically consistent manner, and we also propose adapted numerical methods that satisfy thermodynamical balances at the discrete level. Moreover, this whole approach—both for the model and the numerics—is devised within a hierarchical strategy enabling the coupling of the microscopic sarcomere-level equations with the macroscopic tissue-level description. As an important illustration, coupling our model with a previously proposed simplified heart model, we demonstrate the ability of the modeling and numerical framework to capture the essential features of the Frank–Starling mechanism.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fabrication and characterization of multilayered microstructures with shape memory effects enabling large vertical deployment under electro-thermal actuation. Our previous research demonstrated vertical deployment of such microstructures by the effect of thermal mismatch. Development of equiatomic NiTi layers in the multilayered microstructure is investigated further for shape memory effects. Multilayered microstructures are built by sputtered NiTi layers and a lift-off process. Negative photoresist ma-N1420 enables clean lift-off of 500&nbsp;nm thick NiTi layers by forming a significant undercut profile after development. The parametric study on co-sputter powers for Ti and Ni50Ti50 targets suggests that 100&nbsp;W RF on Ti target and 200&nbsp;W DC on Ni50Ti50 target can deposit Ni49.62Ti50.38 layers. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used to study the crystal structures and surface topography of NiTi layers. XRD results of post-annealed Ni49.62Ti50.38 layers show coexistence of austenite and martensitic phases at room temperature, suggesting that the transformation temperature of such NiTi layers should be approximate 20&nbsp;°C. The surface topography of Ni49.62Ti50.38 layers reveals substantial increase of surface roughness at ambient conditions after the annealing. Experimental verification of the multilayered microstructure for vertical deployment was carried out by Signatone Probe Station and Dual Scanning Electron Microscope/Focused Ion Beam (SEM/FIB) system. A vertical deployment of the two-dimensional (2D) multilayered microstructures for three-dimensional (3D) can be detected by applying a constant voltage of 0.04&nbsp;V, and the expected 3D deployment displacement is enlarged from 2&nbsp;μm to 10&nbsp;μm by introducing the shape memory effect.},

abstract = {The number of patients who die from stomach cancer is still very excessive. Early diagnosis of cancer patients is necessary to reduce the death rate. In this case, a molecular structure classification system can help carry out early diagnosis of cancer. The existing system has some problems. These problems are high cost, low accuracy rate and waste of time. To tackle this problem, this article presents a new method. This method consists of a new size reduction algorithm called as extending extract histogram of oriented gradients (EEHOG). A multimodality size reduction method is obtained by combining the new EEHOG method and other dimension reduction methods (ODRM). Other dimension reduction methods are multidimensional scaling (MDS), Sammon mapping, Isomap, local linear embedding (LLE), Laplacian eigenmaps, stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). As well, extract histogram of oriented gradients (EHOG) features have been calculated in this article. Then, EEHOG + MDS, EEHOG + Sammon mapping, EEHOG + Isomap, EEHOG + LLE, EEHOG + Laplacian Eigenmaps, EEHOG + SNE and EEHOG + t-SNE methods have been used for the dimensional reduction of the EHOG features. Thus, the high dimension of these features has been reduced to lower dimensions with a multimodality size reduction method. These new nominal feature sizes have been given to multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) and random forest (RF) classifier entries for classification of the histopathological stomach images. The accuracy results established by using the EEHOG + ODRM size reduction method are higher than the accuracy results obtained by using only ODRM. The accuracy result obtained with the MLP classifier is found to be higher from the accuracy results obtained with the RF classifier, when the performance of the MLP classifier is compared with the performance of the RF classifier. The stomach cancer images used this article were obtained from F\i{}rat University Medical Faculty Pathology Department. It has been found that the highest accuracy results are obtained as 98.14% with EHOG_EEHOG + LLE_MLP method. The average of the accuracy results obtained with the MLP classifier has been found as 89.57%. However, the average of the accuracy results obtained with the RF classifier has been found as 84.49%. These results have been compared with previous studies. It has been proven that more high accuracy results than single solutions of the multimodality solutions are given.},

Traditional approaches focus on feature engineering, which requires extensive manual efforts and are difficult to generalize to different domains. Recently, deep learning solutions have emerged as the de facto methods which detect online rumors in an end‐to‐end manner. However, they still fail to fully capture the dissemination patterns of rumors. In this study, we propose a novel diffusion‐based rumor detection model, called Macroscopic and Microscopic‐aware Rumor Detection, to explore the full‐scale diffusion patterns of information. It leverages graph neural networks to learn the macroscopic diffusion of rumor propagation and capture microscopic diffusion patterns using bidirectional recurrent neural networks while taking into account the user‐time series. Moreover, it leverages knowledge distillation technique to create a more informative student model and further improve the model performance. Experiments conducted on two real‐world data sets demonstrate that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements over the state‐of‐the‐art baseline models on rumor detection.},

abstract = {The symptoms of cancer normally appear only in the advanced stages, so it is very hard to detect resulting in a high mortality rate among the other types of cancers. Thus, there is a need for early prediction of lung cancer for the purpose of diagnosing and this can result in better chances of it being able to be treated successfully. Histopathology images of lung scan can be used for classification of lung cancer using image processing methods. The features from lung images are extracted and employed in the system for prediction. Grey level co-occurrence matrix along with the methods of Gabor filter feature extraction are employed in this investigation. Another important step in enhancing the classification is feature selection that tends to provide significant features that helps differentiating between various classes in an accurate and efficient manner. Thus, optimal feature subsets can significantly improve the performance of the classifiers. In this work, a novel algorithm of feature selection that is wrapper-based is proposed by employing the modified stochastic diffusion search (SDS) algorithm. The SDS, will benefit from the direct communication of agents in order to identify optimal feature subsets. The neural network, Na\"{\i}ve Bayes and the decision tree have been used for classification. The results of the experiment prove that the proposed method is capable of achieving better levels of performance compared to existing methods like minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and correlation-based feature selection.},

abstract = {Digital holography is an imaging process able to recreate three-dimensional representations of objects from recording pattern interference among distinct waves. The in-line configuration setup is a variant considered the simplest physical implementation, providing a feasible manner for acquisition and the same time higher resolution for free-living microscopy imaging using a single illumination system. However, the well-known twin-image problem is bounded to the technique, since there is no separation among reference and objects beams in this configuration. As a result, computational numerical diffraction routines present the twin-image effect intrinsically, imposing several difficulties in terms of post-processing requirements. In this context, this paper aims to present a numerical approach able to provide consistent suppression of twin-image problem for in-line holography, during the numerical diffraction procedure for phase retrieval, combining image subtraction and edge detection techniques. The proposed solution was implemented in Python language, and metrics defined to assess it were both qualitative and quantitative, based on edge detection and some image comparison metrics. The obtained results of the proposed approach present a significant reduction in the twin-image artifacts in the reconstructions of both experimental and simulated holograms, considering a spherical reference wave, regardless of the shapes and sizes of objects.},

abstract = {The present work analyses the effect of three spatial filters, modelling the psychophysics data on brightness perception, when applied to a difficult computer vision problem. This pertains to the automatic grain-matrix segmentation of cross-polar images of sedimentary rock thin sections, gathered through petrographic microscopy. These three filters are assumed to be modelling three modes of vision, viz. vision-at-a-glance (VG, through Magnocellular or M channel in primate visual pathway), vision-in-strong-contrast mode (VSC, through Parvocellular or P channel of visual pathway), and vision-with-scrutiny (VS, through Magno-Parvochannels combined referred as the PM filter). The aforementioned biologically inspired filters related to brightness–contrast modelling are applied on the cross-polar microscopic images. Then binary segmentation is performed on the original, as well as the filtered, images using a k-means clustering algorithm which effectively segment the input images according to the homogeneity present. The binary segmented output when compared with our manually built grain-matrix segmented ground truth using suitable indices, forecasts noticeable difference in terms of the applied filter on them and the grain size distribution in that image, manifested sometimes by the resolution scale of capturing the image. Mostly for images with higher resolution of microscope lens while capturing, or for images displaying larger grain size, the PM filtered image has shown better grain-matrix segmentation, though the effect of filtering is not very pronounced for such images. On the other hand, for lower resolution of microscope lens for capturing the image or for smaller grain size featured images, the P filtered image has consistently shown more accurate grain-matrix aggregation result as also distinct improvement over those not filtered. The novelty of the approach lies in the application of a psychophysics model that attempts to mimic the manual segmentation performed by the trained eye of the expert in various visual modes. The proposed method achieves a reasonably higher accuracy in grain segmentation when compared with relevant existing methods especially while dealing with more difficult images containing many small-sized grains.},

We propose an approximation of the metric through its finite-dimensional counterparts. This result leads to a new statistical test for testing the equality of distributions of two random convex compact sets. Consequently, we show a heuristic approach how to determine whether two realisations of random sets that can be approximated by a union of identically distributed random convex compact sets come from the same underlying process using the constructed test. Each procedure is justified by an extensive simulation study and the heuristic method for comparing random sets using their convex compact counterparts is moreover applied to real data concerning histological images of two different types of mammary tissue.},

The framework considers the balance of linear momentum including inertia at the microscale to capture possible dynamic effects arising from micro heterogeneities. A finite-strain formulation is adapted to account for geometrical nonlinearities enabling the study of e.g. plasticity or fiber pullout, which may be associated with large deformations. A consistent kinematic scale link is established as displacement constraint on the whole representative volume element. The consistent macroscopic material tangent moduli are derived including micro inertia in closed form. These can easily be calculated with a loop over all microscopic finite elements, only applying existing assembly and solving procedures. Thus, making it suitable for standard finite element program architectures. Numerical examples of a layered periodic material are presented and compared to direct numerical simulations to demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework. In addition, a simulation of a split Hopkinson tension test showcases the applicability of the framework to engineering problems.},

abstract = {The majority of topology optimization methods for porous infill designs is based on the assumption of deterministic loads. However, in practice, quantities such as positions, weights, and directions of applied loads may change accidentally. Deterministic load-based designs might deliver poor structural performance under loading uncertainties. Such uncertain factors need to be taken into account in topological optimization to seek robust results. This paper presents a novel robust concurrent topology optimization method for the design of uniform/non-uniform porous infills under the accidental change of loads. A combination of moving morphable bars (MMBs) and loading uncertainties is proposed to directly model multiscale structures and seek robust designs. The macro- and microscopic structures can be simultaneously optimized through the minimization of the weighted sum of the expected compliance and standard deviation. The geometries of adaptive geometric components (AGCs) are straightforwardly optimized. The AGCs consist of two classes of geometric components: macroscopic bars describing the overall structure and microscopic bars describing the material microstructures. Automatic mesh-refinement is utilized to enhance computing efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate that robust porous design can be obtained with only one global volume constraint while the material continuity of neighboring unit cells and the structural porosity can be maintained without additional constraints. The robust designs yield a more robust structural performance along with a smaller standard deviation compared with deterministic porous designs under loading uncertainties.},

abstract = {The digital transmission amongst vehicles and roadway equipment is necessary for the realization of smart transportation systems. Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANet) is an ascension field of engineering that presents brilliant transport applications, road safety, comfort and luxury to drivers. VANet protocols face many challenges because of the changing nature of vehicular ad-hoc network. VANet routing protocols perform a vital role in terms of the performance efficiency because they decide the mode of sending and receiving packets between mobile vehicular nodes. Finding suitable and efficient routing protocol is very important for the efficient implementation of VANet. The foremost objective of this research is to suggest the relevant and efficient VANet routing protocols in a high traffic density area. This research work presents a practical evaluation of the VANet topology’s features with respect to time for the high traffic situations. This evaluation incorporates the actual creation of roadway layout. An accurate traffic flow is produced by extracting run-time facts and figures from PeMS (Freeway Performance Measurement System) database and assigning this extracted information into a microscopic mobility model. To achieve our goal, we consider three routing protocols i.e., AOMDV, AODV and DSDV. The simulation results prove that the performance of AOMDV is greater in comparison to DSDV and AODV protocols in high traffic density areas. The AOMDV protocol improves overall network performance by achieving maximum throughput and minimum end to end delay.},

abstract = {Based on microscopic water displacement experiments and numerical simulation results, new pore-scale displacement indexes were established and subsequently used to analyze oil and water flow characteristics and evaluate water displacement effectiveness. Thus, our understanding was deepened of remaining oil extraction by increasing liquid withdrawal and adjusting water-driving streamline at the high water-cut stage. Results show that water displacement is a process by which both pore sweep coefficient and inner-pore displacement coefficient are increasing simultaneously, resulting in the increase of microscopic comprehensive displacement efficiency. Preferential flow exists in the water displacement process. At the high water-cut stage, enlargement of velocity and pressure difference between the dominant and non-dominant flow channel indicates the injected water is channeling along the dominant flow channel, so that pore sweep coefficient grows slowly and even levels off, which slows down the increase of the comprehensive displacement efficiency. An inflection can be seen at remaining oil dispersion curve in high water-cut period which implies low utilization of the injected water and poor water displacement effectiveness. Increasing liquid withdrawal, to some extent, can decrease the pressure gap between the dominant and non-dominant flow channel and hence increase pore sweep coefficient. Adjusting water-drive streamline can greatly increase pore sweep coefficient by reducing the injected water channeling along the dominant flow channel and tapping the remaining oil in non-dominant flow channel, and therefore obtains a better response in improving water displacement efficiency.},

abstract = {Recently proposed methods for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation have achieved impressive performance in predicting pixel classes despite being trained with only image labels which lack positional information. Because image annotations are cheaper and quicker to generate, weak supervision is more practical than full supervision for training segmentation algorithms. These methods have been predominantly developed to solve the background separation and partial segmentation problems presented by natural scene images and it is unclear whether they can be simply transferred to other domains with different characteristics, such as histopathology and satellite images, and still perform well. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods on natural scene, histopathology, and satellite image datasets and analyzes how to determine which method is most suitable for a given dataset. Our experiments indicate that histopathology and satellite images present a different set of problems for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation than natural scene images, such as ambiguous boundaries and class co-occurrence. Methods perform well for datasets they were developed on, but tend to perform poorly on other datasets. We present some practical techniques for these methods on unseen datasets and argue that more work is needed for a generalizable approach to weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.

abstract = {In chromosome analysis, centromere is an essential component. By analyzing centromere, genetic disorder can be identified easily. In this paper, automatic classification and centromere detection in human chromosome image using Band Distance Feature is proposed. Initially the microscopic image of G-band chromosome is preprocessed in order to remove the blobs. Then, the image is segmented using labelling algorithm and the endpoints are calculated. Now, the overlapping chromosomes are removed when the number of end points is greater than two. The non-overlapped chromosomes are straightened using Reversible Projection algorithm. From the straightened chromosome band distance feature is calculated. The extracted features are given to the ANN classifier to identify the class of chromosome and to calculate the centromere. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed method is superior to the traditional method.},

abstract = {Transportation system management and traveler information systems evolve with the development of data communications and intelligence of traffic simulations. Variety of roadside and mobile sensing platforms will be deployed to allow communication between vehicles with Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC). Traffic data received from moving vehicles will be transmitted to each individual vehicle and traffic management center to provide real time traffic information. Microscopic traffic simulation models will be used for generating intelligence from real time data in the form of traffic analysis and prediction, since they have the highest detailed level of prediction such as vehicle / driver characteristics and have the capability to capture dynamically changing traffic conditions through the simulation. In this study, three communication methods for data communication and intelligence in traffic simulation environments are used including Ethernet, off-the-shelf wireless network, and one commercial network provider for data communication. Simulation time is measured and statistically analyzed using three different communication methods and one non-communication case. Also, traffic simulation performance is investigated to demonstrate the intelligence of traffic simulation tools in modeling traffic congestion.},

abstract = {Classification of histopathological images is one of the important areas of research in the field of medical imaging. However, the complexities available in histopathological images make the classification process difficult. For such complex images, selection of prominent features for image classification is also a challenging task and is still an open research area for computer vision researchers. Therefore, an effective method for the selection of prominent features of images has been introduced in this work. For the same, an improved Henry gas solubility optimisation has been introduced in which a new position update equation has been used to balance the global and local search. The selected features are then input to classifiers to identify histopathological images. For the performance analysis of improved Henry gas solubility optimisation, 23 benchmark functions are used. The proposed feature selection method has been analysed over two datasets, namely breast cancer cell dataset and ICIAR grand challenge dataset. The proposed feature selection method eliminates the maximum 60% average features from both the datasets. To validate usefulness of selected features, results of different classifiers are compared. Experimental results show that the presented method outperforms other methods.},

abstract = {This work reports, the obtainment and stabilization of organic nanoparticles (γ-sitosterol) and Ag cations on the external area of Ca-clinoptilolite zeolite (Z17) are presented. The novelty of the present study lies in the formation and stabilization of nanoparticle organic molecules (γ-sitosterol) and inorganic cations (Ag) on the external area of Ca-clinoptilolite zeolite. The γ-sitosterol nanoparticles were obtained using Tournefortia hirsutissima and were later stabilized on the external area of Ca-clinoptilolite. The Ca-clinoptilolite-rich mineral as well as silver zeolitic minerals was characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); elementary composition of the zeolitic mineral was determined by microanalyses (EDS) and high-resolution adsorption (HRADS) using N2 adsorption as a probe molecule. The EDS results about the exchange with Ag indicate the following sequence: Z17Ag03 &gt; Z17Ag-09 &gt; Z17Ag-06 &gt; Z17Ag-01. The XRD studies indicate that only in the sample Z17Ag-03 there is an average crystal size of nanoparticles formed of 45.387 nm as determined by Sherrer’s equation. SEM images of clinoptilolite showed the presence of crystals with irregular and poorly defined box shapes that are typical for this type of zeolites. The nanoporosity of natural zeolites was studied by N2 adsorption; external areas were estimated through the De Boer and BET equations. The specific surface area calculated by BET equation, ASB, presents the following sequence: γ-SZ17 &gt; Z17 &gt; Z17Ag09 &gt; Z17Ag03 &gt; Z17Ag01 &gt; Z17Ag06, while for the values of the external area obtained by the t method, the sequence is AST: γ-Z17 &gt; Z17 &gt; Z17Ag03 &gt; z17Ag09 &gt; Z17Ag06 &gt; Z17Ag01. For its part, the pore size distributions tell us that the sample Z17 exhibits a sharp multimodal distribution with pore size maxima happening at 1.262, 1.933, 3.824, and 4.282 nm. Z17Ag01 exhibits a bimodal distribution with pore size maxima occurring at 5.45 and 5.533 nm. The sample Z17Ag06 exhibits a sharp bimodal distribution with pore size maxima happening at 3.666 and 7.021 nm, and the sample Z17Ag09 exhibits a sharp trimodal distribution with pore size maxima happening at 1.853, 4.275 and 5.967 nm. Antibacterial activities of the exchanged samples with Ag on the external surface area were measured as a function of exchange level against Gram-positive bacteria (P. aureoginosa, K. pneumonie, and A. baumannii) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, S. saprophyticcus, S. aureus, and E. feacalis); the selectivity sequence of the clinoptilolite and antibacterial activity results are presented. Z17Ag09 clinoptilolite seemed to be a promising antibacterial material.},

abstract = {Hematite nanoparticles have been prepared from Moringa oleifera leaf extracts. Phytochemicals are derived from plant extracts which act as a stabilizing and capping agent as well as a surfactant. This green route protocol is attractive owing to its speed, reliability, and ecofriendly and cost-effective qualities. The synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles were subjected to three different calcination temperatures (500, 600, and 700°C). The crystallinity nature and phase purity have been confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Optical properties have been studied by UV-visible (UV-vis) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). A very narrow bandgap was observed, and absorbance was observed at the visible region. Photoluminescence spectra have exhibited a multicolor emission band from the near UV to visible region due to defect centers (F centers). EDX (energy dispersive X-ray spectrum) has given information on the stoichiometric ratio of Fe and O. The functional groups which are responsible for nanoparticle formation have been identified by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface morphology transformation has been illustrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies, and VSM measurements have exhibited a hysteresis curve that shows the weak and strong ferromagnetic behavior in nature at RT. TEM micrographs have confirmed that particles are in the nanorange, matching the results from the XRD report. The SAED pattern gives information on the polycrystalline nature of hematite nanoparticles. TG-DSC characterization revealed phase transition, decomposition, and weight loss information. Frequency-dependent electrical properties were studied. Here, we report what the present studies have revealed: that hematite nanopowder prepared from the green route is environmentally friendly, takes a short time to prepare, is an economical and promising candidate material for electromagnetic devices and ferromagnet manufacturing, and is a photocatalyst in water treatment applications without adding additives (H2O2).},

X-ray diffractograms revealed that the samples had hexagonal (wurtzite) structure without a trace of any mixed phase. The average crystallite size of the nanoparticles (NPs) ranged from 39 to 46 nm. The average crystallite size was increased for the initial doping (3 at.%) of Sr ions, and further increase in the doping ratio reduced the particle size due to some distortion produced in the lattice. The surface morphology of the samples and structure of the NPs were investigated using FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy) and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) pictures, respectively. EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray) spectroscopy confirmed the presence of strontium (Sr) in the host lattice. Photoluminescence and X-ray diffraction confirmed that the dopant ions replace some of the lattice zinc ions and that Sr2+ and Sr3+ ions coexist in the ZnO lattice. The Sr-doped ZnO exhibited violet and blue luminescence spectra at 408 nm and 492 nm, respectively. ZnO : Sr nanoparticles showed increased antibacterial activity against one gram-positive as well as one gram-negative bacteria.},

abstract = {Gold nanoparticles capped by carboxymethyl chitosan (AuNPs/CM-chitosan) with particle sizes of 5.2–7.3 nm were successfully synthesized by the γ-irradiation of Au3+ solutions. Their characteristics were analysed by transmission electron microscope images, powder X-ray diffraction patterns, UV-visible spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectra. The antioxidant activity of AuNP/CM-chitosan was time dependent and much higher than that of ascorbic acid at the same concentration. On the other hand, the results of tail vein injection of AuNP/CM-chitosan in mice indicated that this product was not toxic to mice and that AuNPs were mainly distributed in liver tissue, at approximately 77.5%, 6 h after injection. The hepatoprotective activity of AuNP/CM-chitosan was also tested in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxic mice by oral administration at daily doses of 0.5–2 mg/head. The results indicated that compared to the control, supplementation with 2 mg of AuNPs/head strongly reduced the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase indexes in the blood of the tested mice by approximately 66.5 and 69.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the MTT (3[4,5 dimetylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazol bromide) assay on a liver cancer cell line (HepG2) clearly confirmed strong anticancer activity on HepG2 cells treated with 0.05–0.5 mM AuNPs and the tested cells did not survive after treatment with 0.5 mM AuNPs, while the growth of the normal cell line (L929) has no significant effect at the same treated concentration of AuNPs. The AuNP/CM-chitosan in the present study was synthesized by the γ-irradiation method without using any toxic-reducing chemical and stabilized in a natural biocompatible polymer. The strong antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and anticancer effects of this product may be supported to be used in the biomedical field.},

The setup with a cylindrical quartz lens at normal incidence allowed processing a relatively large area of the ZnSe sample in one pass of the laser beam. Morphology analysis of LIPSS by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and image processing reveals the existence of two periods of around 200.0 nm and 630.0 nm simultaneously. All LIPSSs demonstrate the orientation perpendicular to the laser beam polarization. The possible nature of LIPSS formation on ZnSe single crystal is caused by the synergetic influence of the interference mechanism involving surface plasmon polaritons and hydrodynamic effects of surface morphology modification. The fs-laser-induced changes of carrier concentrations in ZnSe specify obtained periods of high spatial frequency LIPSS. The influence of femtosecond laser processing on luminescent properties of ZnSe single crystal has been studied by an analysis of the photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray luminescence (XRL) spectra of laser-treated and untreated areas in the visible region of spectrum at room and low temperatures. The PL spectra and XRL spectra, as well as temperature dependencies of XRL spectra or thermally stimulated luminescence curves, demonstrate a good correlation for untreated and fs-laser-treated ZnSe surfaces. Specific PL bands related to the extended structural defects do not appear for LIPSS at the ZnSe sample under an excitation of 337 nm (3.68 eV). The Relative intensities and position of separate components of observed luminescence bands after ultrashort laser treatment do not change significantly. Thus, the structural perfection of the ZnSe single crystal surface is preserved.},

abstract = {In the present work, the formulation of nanosuspension of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) and the operating parameters of wet ball milling (WBM) was optimized using the Box–Behnken design (BBD) method. The key formulation factors evaluated were GBE concentration, milling speed, milling time, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) concentration. A quadratic model with the correlation coefficient (R2) value of 0.9276 was established based on the experimental data, implying that this model is significant; meanwhile, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the SDS concentration was the most significant factor on particle size, followed by GBE concentration, milling speed, and milling time was the slighter significant factor. The GBE nanosuspension with the particles size of 171.2 nm was prepared under the optimized conditions of GBE concentration (7.459 g/L) in combination with milling time (1.492 h), milling speed (9.253 m/s), and SDS concentration (0.846 g/L). The freeze-dried nanosuspension exhibited spherical particle morphology with uniform size by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the melting behavior of the raw material and milled GBE was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry and it was found that the melting point decreased due to the decrease of particle size. Furthermore, the dissolution rates of the optimized GBE showed better dissolution properties than the unprocessed GBE. The results show that it is feasible to prepare GBE nanosuspension on a commercial scale by WBM to increase the bioavailability of GBE.},

abstract = {In this work, the interaction effect between polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) on the morphology and thermal properties of the nanocomposites have been investigated. PET nanocomposites with the incorporation of 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt% of MWCNTs and GNPs were prepared by the melt compounding and injection moulding method. The presence of MWCNTs and GNPs in the PET matrix was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. MWCNTs and GNPs acted as a nucleating agent which enhanced the crystallization of PET/MWCNT/GNP nanocomposites at both weight percentages. The result obtained from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the incorporation of MWCNTs and GNPs into pure PET improved the thermal stability of the nanocomposites. The nanofillers served as efficient heat sinks which prevent thermal degradation of PET. From the fractured cross-section morphology in field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), the nanofillers displayed good dispersion in the PET matrix. Better dispersion distribution found in 0.1 wt% PET/MWCNTs/GNPs nanocomposites compared to 0.5 wt% PET/MWCNTs/GNPs nanocomposites which favor less mechanical and physical failures like crack, delamination, and agglomeration.},

abstract = {Silver nanoparticle synthesis of the leaf extract Tagetes erecta L. enriched with ascorbic acid and polyphenols has been investigated. The color of the golden yellow extract has changed to pinkish-brown due to the reduction of Ag+ to the colloidal solution of AgNPs and a sharp absorption peak at 420 nm under the UV-Vis spectrophotometer. In addition, the Fourier Transfer Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) estimation was completed in order to recognize and identify the biomolecules present in the extract acting as a reducing and capping agent for the AgNPs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks at (111), (201), (220), and (311) confirm the presence of monoclinic crystals in the solution. The morphology and size of the particles were provided by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of AgNPs. At a scale of 100 nm, synthesized AgNPs were predominantly spherical with a size range of 7-35 nm. In comparison to 7.39 mg/100 g in AgNPs, aqueous leaf extract was 55.14 mg/100 g higher in ascorbic acid. The phenolic and flavonoid content of extract was 52.54±2.15 mg (GAE/100 g) and 15.43±0.34 mg (QE/mL), and the colloidal AgNP solution was 21.45±1.15 mg (GAE/100 g) and 8.05±2.42 mg (QE/mL), respectively. Phenolic and flavonoid contents play a major role as a reducing agent and reduce the precursor AgNO3 into AgNPs. The DPPH scavenging assay also assessed the antioxidant properties of extract and its derived AgNPs. As compared antioxidant value to aqueous leaf extract (mg/mL), higher percentage inhibition (PI) was found in AgNPs and free-radical scavenging activity of extract and AgNPs were directly linked to their concentrations. Results of this research have discovered a higher potential for free-radical scavenging AgNPs and will help to develop new and more potent antioxidants for the treatment of different diseases caused by oxidative stress; the higher antioxidant properties bearing AgNPs might be used.},

abstract = {Fungicides have been extensively used to control fungal diseases that affect several crops including ornamental crops. However, concerns have arisen due to a development of fungicide resistance and increasing incidences of fungicide toxicity effects on nontarget organisms. As zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) have demonstrated effective antimicrobial activity, this study is therefore aimed at synthesizing ZnO NPs from banana peels using a green chemistry method in a large scale and determines their physical properties including their inhibitory effects against a plant pathogen fungus causing anthracnose in orchids, Colletotrichum sp. Results from X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope indicated that the synthesized ZnO NPs were obtained without other crystalline impurities, and they were spherical in shape with the average diameter of 256±40 nm, respectively. The absorption peak was found to be centered at ~370 nm with the optical band gap value approximately 2.8 eV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of several functional groups on synthesized ZnO NPs. The total amount of synthesized ZnO NPs was obtained about 170 g for a synthesis reaction. By performing the antifungal activity assay, high doses of green synthesized ZnO NPs significantly inhibited growth of isolated Colletotrichum sp. (KUFC 021) on culture plates. Under greenhouse conditions, high doses of synthesized ZnO NPs also significantly reduced anthracnose symptoms on inoculated orchid leaves with the Colletotrichum sp. (KUFC 021).},

This study is aimed at optimizing the fabrication of hybrid organic–inorganic lead iodide perovskite layer by a two-step method modified by a double dip coating process which enables to control the perovskite crystallization and morphology. The duration time of each circle for the step of dipping PbI2 film to methylammonium iodide solution was varied from 90 to 240 second. The obtained perovskite films were characterized by X-ray diffraction to evaluate the transformation of PbI2 reactant to the perovskite product and its crystallization, by scanning electron microscopy to observe its morphology. Then, the perovskite films were implemented in functional perovskite solar cell devices followed by current–voltage characterization. Results showed that the perovskite was formed via an equilibrium process which reached an optimum transformation of PbI2 to the product after 2\texttimes{}150 second circle dip coating, and its morphology was smooth with the least voids. The solar cell devices fabricated at the optimum conditions achieved a comparable performance of about 14%.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is a fatal disease and is a leading cause of death in women worldwide. The process of diagnosis based on biopsy tissue is nontrivial, time-consuming, and prone to human error, and there may be conflict about the final diagnosis due to interobserver variability. Computer-aided diagnosis systems have been designed and implemented to combat these issues. These systems contribute significantly to increasing the efficiency and accuracy and reducing the cost of diagnosis. Moreover, these systems must perform better so that their determined diagnosis can be more reliable. This research investigates the application of the EfficientNet architecture for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin-stained breast cancer histology images provided by the ICIAR2018 dataset. Specifically, seven EfficientNets were fine-tuned and evaluated on their ability to classify images into four classes: normal, benign, in situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma. Moreover, two standard stain normalization techniques, Reinhard and Macenko, were observed to measure the impact of stain normalization on performance. The outcome of this approach reveals that the EfficientNet-B2 model yielded an accuracy and sensitivity of 98.33% using Reinhard stain normalization method on the training images and an accuracy and sensitivity of 96.67% using the Macenko stain normalization method. These satisfactory results indicate that transferring generic features from natural images to medical images through fine-tuning on EfficientNets can achieve satisfactory results.},

XRD and SAED patterns confirmed the crystalline nanostructure of the metal nanoparticles. FTIR spectra revealed the functional groups of biomolecules presented in the extract possibly responsible for reducing metallic ions and stabilizing formed nanoparticles. The biosynthesized metal nanoparticles have potential application in catalysis.

Most piezoelectric ceramic micromotion platforms are used for that, and hysteresis characteristics are the main reason for the nonlinear characteristics of piezoelectric ceramics and the influence on the control accuracy. In order to solve this problem, backpropagation algorithm based on whale optimization algorithm is used to model the hysteresis, which is directly used as a feedforward controller to compensate the hysteresis effect, and the robust adaptive moving average control method is used for feedback control. The results show that the hysteresis model of backpropagation algorithm based on the whale optimization algorithm can fit the hysteresis curve well, and the maximum fitting error is 0.2050 μm, only 0.256%. By adopting feedforward and feedback, feedforward robust adaptive moving average control algorithm decreases the hysteresis from 17.64% to 2.51%, which enables the output of the piezoelectric ceramic controller to track the expected displacement well and makes it possible to improve the scanning accuracy.},

abstract = {In this work, an eco-friendly approach for the synthesis of biogenic silver nanoparticles (bio-AgNPs) using botanical extracts in combination with an electrochemical process was carried out. We employed three types of plant extracts, including green tea leaf (GTE), grapefruit peel (GP), and mangosteen peel (MP) extracts to successfully synthesize the bio-AgNPs and optimized the experimental conditions aiming to get the highest synthetic yield. The formation of bio-AgNPs was monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy via a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at about 420–430 nm. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed their spherical shape with the size range within 23–55 nm. While X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis described in detail the crystalline structure of the bio-AgNPs with a face-centered cubic crystal lattice of metallic silver. The chemical bonding and elemental compositions of the bio-AgNPs were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in which organic compounds in the natural extracts not only acted as effective reductants but also capping agents for the fabricated bio-AgNPs. The prepared bio-AgNPs exhibited high stability and excellent dispersion for about four months. Based on the linear relationship between obtained SPR band intensity of bio-AgNP GTE in the presence of Fe (III) and concentration of Fe (III) ions, our bio-AgNP GTE can be used to develop a highly selective colorimetric sensor for the determination of Fe (III) ions within a linear range from 1 to 25 μM. According to that, the limit of detection (LOD) was recorded at approximately 0.532 μM, and the quantitative limit (LOQ) was calculated to be 1.77 μM. A detection mechanism was proposed through redox reactions between bio-AgNP GTE and Fe (III) ions. More interestingly, this method was successfully applied for the determination of Fe (III) ions in a lake water sample with percentage recovery of 107-150% and high reproducibility (RSD=1.49%).},

abstract = {Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are highly efficient photosensitizers in traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT). The particle size of TiO2-NPs is small, only about 20 nm. However, the demands of ultraviolet light (UV) excitation feature shallow tissue penetration depth and may lead to severe tissue photon damage. Thus, in this research, TiO2-NPs are modified with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) CdX (X = S, Te, Se) in various methods, such as ultrasonic, hydrothermal, sol-gel, aqueous phase, and hydrolysis precipitation. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the size of CdSe-TiO2 is ranging from 6 to 14 nm. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum demonstrates that the CdX (X = S, Te, Se) modification can successfully extend the absorption range of TiO2-NPs into a different visible light region. CdSe QDs have the narrowest band gap compared with CdX (X = S, Te, Se) QDs. Visible light-activated CdSe-TiO2 nanocomposite shows the highest PDT inactivation efficiency toward HL60 cells compared with CdX-TiO2. The photogenerated carrier separation efficiency of CdSe-TiO2 nanocomposite is the highest shown in a fluorescence spectrum (FS). Furthermore, when conjugated with folic acid (FA), the prepared FA-CdX-TiO2 (X = S, Se) exhibits excellent cancer-targeting ability during PDT treatment. Optimum PDT efficiency of FA-CdSe-TiO2 indicates that photocatalytic and targeting ability is much higher than pure TiO2 and CdSe-TiO2. Our results provided a detailed investigation on the PDT performance of CdX (X = S, Te, Se) modified TiO2 and may act as a guide for further design of highly targeted performance visible-light response TiO2-NPs.},

abstract = {It is well known that spontaneous drying of some fluid droplets on certain solid surfaces forms a “coffee ring” pattern. In this paper, we studied “coffee ring” formation for two kinds of Ag colloidal nanoparticles (borohydride-reduced (b.-r.) and hydroxylamine-reduced (h.-r.)) and its impact on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Optical and scanning electron microscopies were used to observe the morphology of the dried rings as well. We used 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP) as a testing SERS molecular probe. The results showed that the structure of the edge rings of dried drops of Ag colloid/TMPyP systems was different for b.-r. and h.-r. nanoparticles. The inherent limitation of our approach is inhomogeneity in particle and “hot spots” distribution, SERS signal fluctuation, and consequently low spectral reproducibility. However, in the case of h.-r. nanoparticles, it formed a structure with highly enhancing sites (“hot spots”) providing enormous SERS signal of TMPyP. Higher sensitivity and the possibility of spectral mapping over the dried pattern are advantages in comparison with the measurements from colloidal suspension. Although our approach is not reliable for quantitative analytical SERS applications, it can serve as a simple, cheap, and fast prescan method, which can be easily implemented for preliminary SERS analysis.},

Fresh extracted onion, cabbage, carrot, and tomato of ZnO NPs are characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-visible spectroscopy. FTIR findings demonstrate that the prepared nanoparticles were observed in the spectrum of 626 cm-1–1219 cm-1 with some other functional groups. Wurtzite hexagonal structure of the prepared ZnO NPs was observed from XRD results. In addition, the prepared nanoparticles were failed into nanoscales (17 nm, 18 nm, 24 nm, and 15 nm) calculated from Scherrer’s equation. Nearly spherical shapes were seen from SEM image for onion and tomato extraction while rod and tube for carrot and cabbage, respectively. Two broad peaks were observed from UV-vis spectroscopy results for each extract. The presence of a wide range of energy bandgaps in the region of 3-4 eV was detected, indicating that ZnO NP material can be employed in metal oxide semiconductor-based systems. The dye-sensitive solar cell based on ZnO NPs has been successfully synthesized, and the efficiency of the device has been evaluated by measuring the current density-voltage behaviour under the presence of artificial sunshine. The increased effectiveness of the manufactured dye-sensitive solar cell is attributable to a large improvement in dye molecular adsorption onto the surface of ZnO NPs. Thus, the usage of the green produced ZnO NPs with creating dye sensitivity solar cell is a simple and viable way for the well-being of our future.},

As current therapeutic drugs for the treatment of infections, such as candidiasis and other Candida-related infections, have adverse effects on human health, discovering new antifungal drugs from natural products is urgently needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of the methanolic and sodium phosphate buffer extracts derived from various parts of Myrtus communis, a plant that is traditionally used in Saudi Arabia, against Candida albicans (ATCC 10213), Candida glabrata (ATCC 2001), Candida kefyr (ATCC 66028), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), and Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750). A well diffusion assay was performed to assess the antifungal activity through the measurement of the zone of inhibition. Of the extracts, those extracted with methanol from the roots and leaves displayed strong inhibitory activity against Candida glabrata (23.5±0.12 and 20.7±0.22, respectively), at 50 mg/ml, with 5 mg/ml fluconazole administered as the standard control. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values were 12.5 mg/ml and 25 mg/ml for the M. communis root extract and 25 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml for the M. communis leaf extract against Candida glabrata. The results were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of the control and treated strains of Candida glabrata. Based on SEM, these extracts could alter the morphology and cause loss of cell integrity. The effect of M. communis root and leaf extracts on Candida cells was also determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm after treatment for 1 h at 37°C. Interestingly, the 260 nm absorbing material was higher in Candida glabrata than in the resistant strain, Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019). Based on our findings, the crude methanolic extract of M. communis roots and leaves exhibited good antifungal activity against the Candida glabrata strain. SEM results and estimation of the 260 nm absorbance material proved that the extract might act on the cell wall and cell membrane of Candida cells, further leading to cell death.},

abstract = {Nanotechnology from titanium dioxide has been deposited, and its application in desalination and water treatment has been investigated by using sol-gel methods. Homogeneously dispersed sphere shapes of titanium dioxide nanoparticles were observed from scanning electron microscope micrographs and decrease in size as aging time increases from 40 min to 60 min. SEM micrographs of highly transparent nanopowders show that they are detected in the visible region from UV/visible and that their red shift around maximum wavelength increases with increasing aging time due to an increase in water quality. The energy band gap of the generated nanosheet has narrowed as the aging time has increased, which is related to the red shift of the absorption spectrum edge in the sheet. The structural behaviors of deposited nanoparticles have also been investigated, which confirms the existence of anatase as well as rutile levels in the liquid phase. The findings of the PL allowed us to determine the total strength of the intensity. This shows that applying photodegradation by a solar absorber could play a vital role in desalination and water treatment.},

Agrowastes are rich in proteins, phenolics, and flavonoids that could act as bioreductant agents in AgNP biological synthesis. The present study was aimed at synthesizing AgNPs via chemical and biological methods using trisodium citrate, pomegranate fruit peel, and coffee ground waste extracts. Moreover, silver nanoparticles were monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy and characterized using zeta potential, size distribution mean, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Four pathogenic bacterial strains (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and MRSA) were used to assess the antimicrobial effect of the synthesized AgNPs (2, 4, and 8 mg/ml). Results report the successful formation of silver nanoparticles chemically (AgNPs_Chem) and biologically by using pomegranate peel extract (AgNPs_PPE) and coffee ground waste extract (AgNPs_CE) due to the change of color to dark brown that is confirmed by UV-vis sharp absorption spectra at specific wavelengths. Characterization using SEM and XRD revealed their crystalline shape with a mean size of AgNPs_Chem=62.75, AgNPs_CE=273.7 nm, and AgNPs_PPE=591.9 nm. AgNPs_Chem show higher negativity of zeta potential (−46.7 mV) than AgNPs_CE (−12.6 mV), followed by AgNPs_PPE (−7.98 mV), which had the least stability. All the synthesized AgNPs show antimicrobial potential on all selected strains. However, 8 mg/ml shows the most effective concentration and has more efficiency on K. pneumoniae than others. Overall, the results highlight that the use of agrowastes could be an ecofriendly way to synthesize AgNPs biologically that have the same antimicrobial effect as the chemically synthesized AgNPs.},

abstract = {We target the problem of estimating the center of mass of objects in noisy two-dimensional images. We assume that the noise dominates the image, and thus many standard approaches are vulnerable to estimation errors, e.g., the direct computation of the center of mass and the geometric median which is a robust alternative to the center of mass. In this paper, we define a novel surrogate function to the center of mass. We present a mathematical and numerical analysis of our method and show that it outperforms existing methods for estimating the center of mass of an object in various realistic scenarios.
As a case study, we apply our centering method to data from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), where the goal is to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules. We show how to apply our approach for a better translational alignment of molecule images picked from experimental data. In this way, we facilitate the succeeding steps of reconstruction and streamline the entire cryo-EM pipeline, saving computational time and supporting resolution enhancement.},

abstract = {Investigation of dynamic processes in cell biology very often relies on the observation in two dimensions of three-dimensional (3D) biological  processes.
Consequently, the data are partial and statistical methods and models are required to recover the parameters describing the dynamical
processes. In the case of molecules moving over the 3D surface, such as proteins on walls of bacteria cell, a large portion of the 3D
surface is not observed in two-dimensional (2D)-time microscopy. It follows that biomolecules may disappear for a period of time in a region of interest,
and then reappear later. Assuming Brownian motion with drift, we address the mathematical problem of the reconstruction of biomolecules
trajectories on a cylindrical surface. A subregion of the cylinder is typically recorded during the observation period, and biomolecules
may appear or disappear in any place of the 3D surface. The performance of the method is demonstrated on simulated particle trajectories
that mimic MreB protein dynamics observed in 2D time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in rod-shaped bacteria.},

abstract = {This paper investigates superresolution in deconvolution driven by sparsity priors. The observed signal is a convolution of an original signal with a continuous kernel. With the prior knowledge that the original signal can be considered as a sparse combination of Dirac delta peaks, we seek to estimate the positions and amplitudes of these peaks by solving a finite dimensional convex problem on a computational grid. Because the support of the original signal may or may not be on this grid, by studying the discrete de-convolution of sparse peaks using the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$ell _1$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;-norm, we confirm recent observations that canonically the discrete reconstructions will result in multiple peaks at grid points adjacent to the location of the true peak. Owing to the complexity of this problem, we analyse carefully the de-convolution of single peaks on a grid and gain a strong insight about the dependence of the reconstructed magnitudes on the exact peak location. This in turn allows us to infer further information on recovering the location of the exact peaks i.e. to perform super-resolution. We analyze in detail the possible cases that can appear and based on our theoretical findings, we propose an self-driven adaptive grid approach that allows to perform superresolution in one-dimensional and multi-dimensional spaces. With the view that the current study can contribute in the development of more robust algorithms for the detection of single molecules in fluorescence microscopy or characteristic frequencies in spectroscopy, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can recover sparse peaks using simulated signals of low-resolution in one and two-dimensional spaces.},

abstract = {Introducing nanomaterial fillers into a host polymer can significantly change its properties and affect its behaviors. The resulting nanocomposites have the potential to possess new, often enhanced characteristics, making them uniquely qualified for a broader spectrum of new applications. This research investigates the effects of material preparation on nanocomposites using polyimide (PI) as the host polymer and silicon dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles as the filler. The fabrication and characterization of the PI/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites were explored based on samples produced from two different approaches—a direct mixing process using as-purchased SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles and a sol-gel process that relied on chemical reactions to produce SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inside a solvent. The prepared samples and the distribution of the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles in the nanocomposites were characterized with profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characterization showed that the directly mixed samples contained visible nanoparticle agglomerates while the sol-gel films had the nanoparticles uniformly distributed inside the host polymer. The DC dielectric breakdown testing revealed that the sol-gel films outperformed the directly mixed samples at both room (300 K) and cryogenic (164 K) temperatures. When the temperature is cooled down to 92 K, the sol-gel samples demonstrated higher dielectric strengths than pure PI films. Our investigation shows that high-quality PI/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites, especially when prepared through the sol-gel process, are promising candidates as dielectrics that can be used in a variety of cryogenic applications.},

abstract = {Thin-film piezoelectric materials are currently employed in micro- and nanodevices for energy harvesting and mechanical sensing. The deposition of these functional layers, however, is quite challenging onto non-rigid/non-flat substrates, such as optical fibers (OFs). Besides the recent novel applications of OFs as probes for biosensing and bioactuation, the possibility to combine them with piezoelectric thin films and metallic electrodes can pave the way for the employment of novel opto-electro-mechanical sensors (e.g., waveguides, optical phase modulators, tunable filters, energy harvesters or biosensors). In this work the deposition of a thin-film piezoelectric wurtzite-phase Aluminium Nitride (AlN), sandwiched between molybdenum (Mo) electrodes, on the curved lateral surface of an optical fiber with polymeric cladding, is reported for the first time, without the need of an orientation-promoting interlayer. The material surface properties and morphology are characterized by microscopy techniques. High orientation is demonstrated by SEM, PFM and X-ray diffraction analysis on a flat polymeric control, with a resulting piezoelectric coefficient (d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;) of ∼5.4 pm/V, while the surface roughness Rms measured by AFM is 9 ÷ 16 nm. The output mechanical sensing capability of the resulting AlN-based &lt;italic&gt;piezo-optrode&lt;/italic&gt; is investigated through mechanical buckling tests: the peak-to-peak voltage for weakly impulsive loads increases with increasing relative displacements (up to 30%), in the range of 20 ÷ 35 mV. Impedance spectroscopy frequency sweeps (10 kHz-1 MHz, 1 V) demonstrate a sensor capacitance of ∼8 pF, with an electrical Q factor as high as 150. The electrical response in the long-term period (two months) revealed good reliability and durability.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for pattern recognition. Traditional ML algorithms have limited ability to reveal the most sophisticated features of cancer histopathological images, but their robustness and fault tolerance can be enhanced by using fuzzy modeling to capture the uncertainty in image data. Therefore, this article proposes a novel CoMHisP framework based on a fuzzy support vector machine with within-class density information (FSVM-WD). It utilizes a novel feature extraction technique by optimizing the block size to extract image micropatterns and computing center of mass (CoM) for each pixel to extract feature vectors. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a CMTHis dataset comprising histopathological images of canine mammary tumor (CMT), a prevalent neoplastic disease in female dogs, and an established model for human breast cancer. Data analysis reveals that stain normalization and magnification influence the performance of the CoMHisP framework, with the best results achieved at lower magnifications after stain normalization. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 97.25% (&lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$pm$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;1.80%) using a FSVM-WD classifier, outperforming both traditional ML and deep FE-VGGNET16-based feature descriptors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a CoM-based feature descriptor has been proposed for histopathological image analysis of CMTs and its performance was evaluated using a fuzzy SVM-based classifier. The proposed method performs well with datasets of limited size and low-magnification images and, therefore, has the potential to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis in low-cost clinical settings.},

abstract = {In this paper, techniques for machining and micro-structuring dimples and grooves on the interior of cylinders using an active rotating tool are discussed. Microscopic dimples and grooves patterned on the inner surface of a cylinder act as lubrication and reduce friction. The active rotating tool presented here is equipped with a gap sensor that can measure the distance between the tool, workpiece, and machining tip so that micron-scale dimples and grooves can be patterned and connected to piezoelectric actuators. Electronic control and power connections are made to the external controller via a slip ring. Accurate measurements of the distance between the tool and workpiece were used to increase the lubrication effect by machining patterns with uniform size and depth. It is difficult to accurately measure errors in cylinders of various shapes using a single gap sensor; thus, we employed two gap sensors to ensure accurate assessment of cylinder shape, and a least mean square algorithm was implemented to compensate for the measured runout errors, which were tracked and compensated using the gap sensor. The method presented here reduces errors on the inner face of a cylinder, and produces a uniform pattern.},

abstract = {Nanometer to micrometer scale colloidal particles are regularly found in applications in which surface forces dominate behavior. Consequently, a wide range of surface force measurement tools have been developed to probe interactions as a function of physiochemical properties. One tool, Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRM), is an exceptionally sensitive probe of both conservative and non-conservative surface forces. A recent variant of TIRM called Scattering Morphology Resolved (SMR) TIRM utilizes the morphology of scattered light in concert with the integrated intensity to measure the position and orientation of a colloidal particle. Although the target of SMR-TIRM is the field of non-spherical “anisotropic” particles, spherical particles have been found to scatter evanescent waves with surprising morphology. Herein, we present experiments and simulations of the scattering morphology of a spherical particle. The morphology was probed as a function of particle size, incident beam polarization, and particle separation distance. We found that spherical particles scattered light with a noncircular morphology. Moreover, we found the morphology depended upon both the scaled particle size with respect to the incident beam wavelength and the incident beam polarization. Although the scattering morphology from the sphere was surprisingly complex, we did not find that these effects would alter the interpretation of scattering as a function of particle separation distance.},

The structural and morphological properties of the immobilized photocatalysts were investigated using atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscope. The photocatalytic efficiency was measured by photodegradation of methylene blue under solar light illumination. The immobilized rGO/TiO2 on shrink thermoplastic film showed doubled photocatalytic efficiency than TiO2 on glass substrate, and no decrease of photocatalytic efficiency was shown after 5&nbsp;h of operation. The use of shrink thermoplastic film and the introduction of graphene material contribute to an increase in catalytic efficiency of 63% and 28%, respectively. These results lead us to believe that the LBL self-assembled rGO/TiO2 composite on shrink thermoplastic film could be used in photocatalytic degradation of other water pollutants.},

abstract = {Automated segmentation of histopathological images is a challenging task to detect cancerous cells in breast tissue. Recent reviews state high accuracy to segment image, but depends on user input, say window area size, time steps, level set, magnification factor and so on. To extract the region of interest effectively, the subject expert performs post‐processing operations several times on the segmentation results with different input values for different parameters say, area opening, fill holes and selects most appropriate enhanced image required for further analysis. The authors proposed an automated segmentation technique followed by self‐driven post‐processing operations to detect cancerous cells effectively. The post‐processing method itself determines the value of different parameters for different operations based on segmented results obtained. The proposed technique has the following features: (i) technique is context sensitive; (ii) no prior setting of time step, weighted area coefficient parameters is required; (iii) magnification independent; (iv) post‐processing operations are self‐driven which enhance segmentation results adaptively. The experimental results are compared with four state‐of‐the‐art techniques: fuzzy C‐means, spatial fuzzy C‐means, spatial neutrosophic distance regularised level set and convolutional neural network‐based PangNet. Experimental results obtained on two publicly available data sets show that the proposed technique outperforms effectively.},

abstract = {Binary phase filters (BPFs) form a special class of optical structure characterized by their distinct concentric rings of alternating 0-π phases. Once placed in the pupil plane of a focusing lens, a BPF generates a sharp elongated focus, which can be utilized for diverse applications ranging from optical trapping to focus scanning microscopy. As demand for BPFs continues to expand, new design techniques are required to tune and optimize filter performance; in this paper, a topology optimization method is presented to extend BPF’s depth-of-focus while maintaining a sharp lateral resolution. In general, binary phase filters can be completely described by three designable characteristics: the radial location of each ring, the width of each ring, and the total number of rings. Conventional BPF design methods typically only consider two of these key design characteristics, often with a predefined number of rings and subsequent sizing optimization of radial locations and widths. Furthermore, these methods often rely on inefficient non-deterministic optimizers like particle swarm and simulated annealing. These implementations ultimately limit design freedom and often require manual investigation of multiple configurations at the expense of computational time and solution quality. Instead, this paper introduces topology optimization (TO) as the first and only method for BPF generation capable of considering all three design characteristics simultaneously and without any predefined assumptions. Here, the TO-based approach is first initialized with a series of concentric rings to cover the entire design domain. Then, similar to classical material distribution problems, the phase value of each concentric ring is optimized directly to satisfy the objective and constraint functions using gradient-based algorithms. This paper describes the new TO-based approach and demonstrates fundamental capabilities and design advantages. Numerical results are validated experimentally and compared with existing approaches with an emphasis on quantitative performance, non-intuitive structure generation, and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Accurate three-phase identification from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) anode micrograph is challenged by both noise and intensity inhomogeneity. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for porous Ni-YSZ cermet anode Optical Microscopy (OM) image segmentation. The proposed framework takes advantage of a statistical model in which an observed image is decomposed into two multiplicative components (bias field and true image) and one additive component (noise). A two-stage Principal Component Analysis with Local Pixel Grouping (LPG-PCA) denoising algorithm is firstly performed to suppress additive noise, it can preserve more image local structural features by modeling a pixel and its nearest neighbors as a vector variable and selecting training samples with similar contents to this variable in a local window for PCA transformation. In order to enhance the robustness to noise, uneven illumination and other outliers, a kernel metric is introduced into fuzzy clustering method embedded with bias field correction for image segmentation. The proposed method has been compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on both simulated images and real SOFC anode OM images. Extensive experiments results have demonstrated that the proposed framework can successfully eliminate the influence of both uneven illumination and noise on real Ni/YSZ anode OM images to obtain a better three-phase identification accuracy. The high-quality segmentation results lay firm foundation for accurate microstructural parameter extraction.},

abstract = {This paper proposes three route control strategies for autonomous vehicles (AVs) exiting to off-ramps. First, two microscopic lane-changing models are developed to simulate the off-ramp behaviors for AVs. A risk factor &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$lambda $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is introduced in the discretionary lane-changing (DLC) model, and a five-step process is developed for the mandatory lane-changing (MLC) model. Second, three route control strategies are presented, i.e., grading strategy (GS), half-overlap strategy (HOS), and full-overlap strategy (FOS). Finally, the extensive numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the characteristics of each strategy based on the MATLAB platform. The results indicate that the studied area displays significant variability in spatiotemporal dynamics of average velocity and road capacity under different strategies. It is found that the GS is the most effective control strategy for traffic congestion dissipation and travel delay reduction, followed by the HOS and, then, the FOS. The road capacity under the GS is increased by 19.1% and 7.8% compared to the FOS and the HOS, respectively. Furthermore, the GS consumes lower costs in terms of safety, travel efficiency, and route and lane switch frequency compared to the HOS and FOS, which is verified as the optimal strategy according to overall running cost. The findings of this paper can provide useful references for the design of AVs as well as the management of the automated highway systems.},

abstract = {Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a clinical biomarker for cancer metastasis. CTCs are cells circulating in the body of patients by being separated from primary cancer and entering into blood vessel. CTCs spread every positions in the body, and this is one of the cause of cancer metastasis. To analyze them, pathologists get information about metastasis without invasive test. CTCs test is conducted by analyzing the blood sample from patient. The fluorescence microscope generates a large number of images per each sample, and images contain a lot of cells. There are only a few CTCs in images and cells often have blurry boundaries. So CTCs identification is not an easy work for pathologists. In this paper, we develop an automatic CTCs identification method in fluorescence microscopy images. This proposed method has three section. In the first approach, we conduct the cell segmentation in images by using filtering methods. Next, we compute feature values from each CTC candidate region. Finally, we identify CTCs using artificial neural network algorithm. We apply the proposed method to 5895 microscopy images (7 samplesas), and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method by using leave-one-out cross validation. We achieve the result of performance tests, a true positive rate is 92.57% and false positive rate is 9.156%.},

abstract = {The paper proposes an efficient methodology for concurrent reliability-based multi-scale design optimization (RBMDO) of composite frames to minimize structural cost subjecting to compliance constraint. Two types of variables are systematically considered in RBMDO, which are deterministic design variables of the frame components, the discrete fiber winding angles at the two geometrical scales, and random parameters of material properties and loading conditions in both magnitude and direction. To overcome the difficulty of highly nonlinear compliance constraint when using fiber winding angles as design variables and improve efficiency and accuracy of RBMDO of composite frames, the improved single loop and single vector (SLSV) approach based on modified chaos control (MCC) scheme, which is abbreviated hereafter as SLSV-MCC, is proposed, and sensitivities at the current design point are utilized to further increase accuracy of the proposed SLSV-MCC. Six types of specific manufacturing constraints are explicitly considered in the proposed RBMDO to reduce the risk of local failure in the laminated composite. The deterministic multi-scale design optimization (DMDO) model is also presented and utilized for comparison to distinguish differences between deterministic and reliability-based optimization results. Efficiency and accuracy of the proposed SLSV-MCC are compared with the first-order reliability method (FORM) and conventional SLSV approach. Meanwhile, the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is further utilized to validate the accuracy of the proposed RBMDO. The discrete material optimization (DMO) approach is utilized to couple two geometrical scales: macroscopic topology and microscopic material selection. Capabilities of the proposed RBMDO are demonstrated by optimization of 2D and 3D composite frames. Numerical study reveals that the uncertainties in material properties and loading conditions will lead to different macroscopic sizing and topology configurations for deterministic and reliability-based solutions.},

abstract = {Inspired by recent work on safe feature elimination for 1-norm regularized least-squares, we develop strategies to eliminate features from convex optimization problems with non-negativity constraints. Our strategy is safe in the sense that it will only remove features/coordinates from the problem when they are guaranteed to be zero at a solution. To perform feature elimination, we use an accurate, but not optimal, primal–dual feasible pair, making our methods robust and able to be used on ill-conditioned problems. We supplement our feature elimination problem with a method to construct an accurate dual feasible point from an accurate primal feasible point; this allows us to use a first-order method to find an accurate primal feasible point and then use that point to construct an accurate dual feasible point and perform feature elimination. Under reasonable conditions, our feature elimination strategy will eventually eliminate all zero features from the problem. As an application of our methods, we show how safe feature elimination can be used to robustly certify the uniqueness of nonnegative least-squares problems. We give numerical examples on a well-conditioned synthetic nonnegative least-squares problem and on a set of 40,000 extremely ill-conditioned problems arising in a microscopy application.},

abstract = {The number of infertile couples considering using assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) is growing. Several key indices, such as sperm concentration and motility, are considered when determining an appropriate technique among the existing ARTs. While microscopy is the only way to observe sperms, this method tends to overlook the actual swimming ability of sperms because sperms can be observed only within a very narrow field of view (FOV). In this paper, we propose a microfluidic chip capable of measuring the motility of sperms by inducing the actual swimming ability of sperms in microchannels. To determine whether sperms swim by themselves and reach the target point, 5–10&nbsp;min is required in an incubator at 37&nbsp;°C, which inevitably causes the evaporation of the fluid at the microfluidic chip inlet or outlet. A unique structure has been added to the microfluidic chip to prevent unwanted fluid flow due to evaporation, and counting and sorting capabilities of the fabricated device have been experimentally demonstrated. The microfluidic chip is shown to have a good agreement with commercial chips in total sperm counting. Another feature of sorting motile and progressive sperm to 95% on one chip is also verified. This feature differentiates our solution from the existing commercial chips and can help increase the success rate of ARTs. The developed MFC can provide a way to determine the actual swimming motility of sperms using a microscope in small clinics or a portable kit which is publicly available without the expensive sperm analysis equipment.},

abstract = {Smart composites with tunable stress–strain curves are explored in a numerical setting. The macroscopic response of the composite is endowed with tunable characteristics through microscopic constituents which respond to external stimuli by varying their elastic response in a continuous and controllable manner. This dynamic constitutive behavior enables the composite to display characteristics that cannot be attained by any combination of traditional materials. Microscopic adaptation is driven through a repetitive controller which naturally suits the class of applications sought for such composites where loading is cyclic. Performance demonstrations are presented for the overall numerical framework over complex paths in macroscopic stress–strain space. Finally, representative two- and three-dimensional tunable microstructures are addressed by integrating the control approach within a computational environment that is based on the finite element method, thereby demonstrating the viability of designing and analyzing smart composites for realistic applications.},

abstract = {We develop a numerical model using both artificial and empirical inputs to analyse taxi dynamics in an urban setting. More specifically, we quantify how the supply and demand for taxi services, the underlying road network, and the public acceptance of taxi ridesharing (TRS) affect the optimal number of taxis for a particular city and commuters’ average waiting time and trip time. Results reveal certain universal features of the taxi dynamics with real-time taxi booking: that there is a well-defined transition between the oversaturated phase when demand exceeds supply and the undersaturated phase when supply exceeds demand. The boundary between the two phases gives the optimal number of taxis a city should accommodate, given the specific demand, road network, and commuter habits. Adding or removing taxis may affect commuter experience very differently in the two phases revealed. In the oversaturated phase, the average waiting time is exponentially affected, whereas in the undersaturated phase it is affected sublinearly. We analyse various factors that can shift the phase boundary and show that an increased level of acceptance for TRS universally shifts the phase boundary by reducing the number of taxis needed. We discuss some of the useful insights for the benefits and costs of TRS, especially how, under certain situations, TRS not only economically benefits commuters but can also save the shared parties in overall travel time by significantly reducing the time commuters spend on waiting for taxis. Simulations also suggest that elementary artificial taxi systems can capture most of the universal features of the taxi dynamics. We give detailed methodologies of the microscopic simulations we employed. The relevance of the assumptions and the overall methodology are also illustrated using comprehensive empirical road network and taxi demand in the city-state of Singapore.},

abstract = {Lung cancer has the highest mortality of any cancer worldwide, and cisplatin is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for lung cancer treatment. Unfortunately, cisplatin resistance is a common cause of therapeutic failure. The ability to overcome chemoresistance is crucial to the effective treatment of lung cancer. Recently, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a type of polyphenol extracted from tea, has been shown to suppress the rapid proliferation of cancer cells, including lung cancer. We tested whether nanoparticles (NPs) carrying a dual drug load, cisplatin and EGCG, could overcome chemoresistance to cisplatin, by working together to kill lung cancer cells. Self-assembling gelatin/EGCG nanoparticles (GE) were synthesized, and cisplatin was then incorporated, to construct a dual drug nanomedicine (EGCG/cisplatin-loaded gelatin nanoparticle, named as GE-Pt NP). The particle size and zeta potential were examined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The morphological structure of GE-Pt NPs was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In vitro testing was performed using a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549). A cytotoxicity examination was performed, using a WST-8 cell proliferation assay. Intracellular cisplatin content was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In conclusion, we successfully prepared GE-Pt NPs, as spherical structures, approximately 75 nm in diameter, with a positive charge (+19.83±0.25 mV). The encapsulation rate of cisplatin in GE-Pt was about 63.7%, and the EGCG loading rate was around 89%. A relatively low concentration of GE-Pt NPs (EGCG 5 μg/mL : cisplatin 2 μg/mL) exhibited significant cytotoxicity, compared to cisplatin alone. The GE-Pt NPs are freely taken up by cells via endocytosis, raising the intracellular cisplatin concentration to a therapeutic level. We consider that combination therapy of cisplatin and EGCG in nanoparticles (GE-Pt NPs) may help overcome cisplatin resistance and could effectively be used in the treatment of lung cancer.},

abstract = {Bone tissue engineering has been introduced several decades ago as a substitute for traditional grafting techniques to treat bone defects using engineered materials. The main goal in bone tissue engineering is to introduce materials and structures which can mimic the function of bone to restore the damaged tissue and promote cell restoration and proliferation. Titania and zirconia are well-known bioceramics which have been widely used in tissue engineering applications due to their unsurpassed characteristics. In this study, hierarchical meso/macroporous titania-zirconia (TiO2-ZrO2) nanocomposite scaffolds have been synthesized and evaluated for bone tissue engineering applications. The scaffolds were produced using the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) technique along with the foamy method. To characterize the samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), simultaneous thermal analysis (STA), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis were performed. The results showed that TiO2-ZrO2 scaffolds can be produced after sintering the samples at 550°C for 2 h. Among samples with different weight percentages of zirconia and titania, the sample containing 13 wt.% zirconia was considered as the optimum sample due to its structural integrity. This scaffold had pore size, pore wall size, and mesopores in the range of 185±66 μm, 15±4 μm, and 7-13 nm, respectively. The specific surface area obtained from the BET theory, total volume, and mean diameter of pores of this sample was 13.627 m2g1-, 0.03788 cm3g-1, and 11 nm, respectively. The results showed that the produced scaffolds can be considered as the promising candidates for cancellous bone regeneration.},

For this purpose, a new D-π-A barbituric acid derivative CB-CYH with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) behavior was synthesized, which can interact with picric acid through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicate that the enhanced emission of the compounds is related to the formation of nano-aggregates. It is well known that an important source of mechanochromic fluorescence (MCF) characteristic materials is the compound with AIE characteristics. The chemosensing test paper prepared by aggregated nanoparticles based on AIE properties is often subjected to external friction or squeeze during transportation or storage, resulting in changes of their optical properties, and destruction of test paper followed. Therefore, the development of compounds with AIE properties and stable optical properties in the presence of external stimuli is particularly important for chemosensing test paper. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) shows that the presence of hydrophobic cycloalkyl group in CB-CYH, which caused the molecules to be closely interspersed with each other; hence, it is difficult to change the microstructure and stacking mode of molecules by external stimulation simultaneously; the optical properties are not changed by external stimuli. Therefore, the test paper based on the AIE effect of CB-CYH was developed as chemosensing test paper for the detection of nitroaromatics.},

In this research work, two noncovalent surfactants with different dispersion mechanisms (Pluronic F-127 (nonionic) and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) (ionic)) were used. We evaluated the influences of various factors on the dispersion quality, such as the surfactant concentration, sonication time, and temperature using UV-visible spectroscopy, optical microscopic image analysis, zeta potentials, and particle size measurement. The effect of tributyl phosphate (TBP) used as an antifoam agent was also evaluated. The optimum suspensions of each surfactant were used to produce cementitious composites, and their mechanical, microstructural, electrical, and thermal behaviors were assessed and analyzed. The best dispersed CNT+GNP aqueous suspensions using Pluronic and SDBS were obtained for concentrations of 10% and 5%, respectively, with 3 hours of sonication, at 40°C, with TBP used for both surfactants. The results also demonstrate that cementitious composites reinforced with CNT+GNP/Pluronic showed better mechanical performance and microstructural characteristics due to the higher quality of the dispersion and the increasing hydration rate. Composites prepared with an SDBS suspension demonstrated lower electrical and thermal conductivities compared to those of the Pluronic suspension due to changes in the intrinsic properties of CNTs and GNPs by the SDBS dispersion mechanism.},

abstract = {In this work, heterostructured catalyst Al2TiO5/TiO2 (ATO/Ti) was synthesized by a two-step method: low-temperature sol-gel process along with hydrothermal treatment in a neutral medium. Characteristics of the fabricated catalyst were analyzed by various techniques including X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller adsorption, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and the point of zero charges. The content of ATO strongly affected the activity of ATO/Ti catalysts for photocatalytic degradation of cinnamic acid (CA). The catalyst, in which 33% TiO2 was replaced by ATO (33ATO/Ti), exhibited the highest activity for the removal of CA. Compared with the bare titanium oxide synthesized in water (TiO2(w)) as well as Al2TiO5 (ATO), the hybrid 33ATO/Ti catalyst exhibited the enhanced photocatalytic activity in the CA degradation under ultraviolet light. The enhancement in the catalytic activity of ATO/Ti could be related to the increase of the specific surface area and the reduction of bandgap energy obtained from the hybridization of TiO2(w) and ATO. The factors as the catalyst dosage (Ccat), the airflow rate (Qair), and the solution initial pH (pH) affected the CA removal efficiency were studied on 33ATO/Ti catalyst. The optimum condition for photodegradation efficiency of CA was found to be at Ccat=0.75 gL−1, Qair=0.3 Lmin−1, and pH=3.8. The highest 60-minute removal efficiency of CA reached 77.1% on 33ATO/Ti compared with 67.1% and 30.4% on TiO2(w) and on ATO, respectively. The recyclability of the 33ATO/Ti was also measured at the optimal parameters. The results showed that, compared with TiO2, the hybrid catalyst was easier to recover and reuse, and its activity decreased by 35% after 6 continuous cycles.},

A magnesium oxide precursor was prepared by heating MgCl2 solution with urea for 12 hours at 90°C. Then the calcined precursor was analysed by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). In the presence of the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 in the system, the reaction yielded in nanospheres of MgO contrast to the plate-like MgO in the absence of the surfactant. The precursor and the calcined product appeared in similar morphologies under SEM in both cases with a slight reduction of size upon calcination. The final product was confirmed as MgO using XRD and FT-IR spectroscopic methods. In TGA, both samples showed similar mass loss values upon elimination of adsorbed water molecules and decomposition of the precursor into MgO; however, the nanospherical MgO sample showed an additional weight loss due to elimination of the associated surfactant molecules. The efficiency of removing reactive dye wastes was quantified by UV-visible spectroscopy using reactive yellow dye. Plate-like MgO showed a porous structure under HR-TEM analysis in the dye adsorption study, and both plate-like and nanospherical MgO showed good dye adsorption capability. MgO nanospheres showed higher capacity of dye adsorption compared to plate-like MgO, explained by its higher surface are-to-volume ratio, while the plate-like MgO also performed well due to having a nanoporous structure. These nanomaterials will offer high potential in purifying waste water and as well in recovering expensive dye products.},

Biodegradable bone scaffold made of various synthetic and natural materials can be used as bone substitutes and grafts for defect site, which has great potential to support bone regeneration. Regulation of cell-scaffold material interactions is an important factor for modulating the cellular activity in bone tissue engineering scaffold applications. Thus, the hydrophilic, mechanical, and chemical properties of scaffold materials directly affect the results of bone regeneration and functional recovery. In this study, a poly-L-lysine (PLL) surface-modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/graphene oxide (GO) (PLL-PLGA/GO) hybrid fiber matrix was fabricated for bone tissue regeneration. Characterization of the resultant hybrid fiber matrices was done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle, and a material testing machine. According to the results obtained from the test above, the PLL-PLGA/GO hybrid fiber matrices exhibited high wettability and mechanical strength. The special surface characteristics of PLL-PLGA/GO hybrid fiber matrices were more beneficial for protein adsorption and inhibit the proliferation of pathogens. Moreover, the enhanced regulation of MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and differentiation was observed, when the resultant hybrid fiber matrices were combined with electrical stimulation (ES). The cellular response of MC3T3-E1 cells including cell adhesion, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium deposition, and osteogenesis-related gene expression was significantly enhanced with the synergistic effect of resultant hybrid fiber matrices and ES. These data indicate that the PLL-PLGA/GO hybrid fiber matrices supported the cellular response in terms of cell proliferation and osteogenesis differentiation in the presence of electrical stimulation, which could be a potential treatment for bone defect.},

abstract = {This work describes a simple single-step method for green synthesis of colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using Litsea cubeba (LC) fruit extract as a reducing as well as stabilizing agent simultaneously. Major parameters affecting the formation of LC-AuNPs, including gold ion concentration, reaction time, and reaction temperature were optimized using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) measurements at a characteristic maximum absorbance of 535 nm. The functional groups responsible for reducing gold ions and capping AuNPs were examined by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the crystalline nature of AuNPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements showed that the biosynthesized LC-AuNPs were mostly spherical with an average size of 8-18 nm. The nanoparticles also demonstrated excellent ultrarapid catalytic activity for the complete reduction of 4-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4 within 10 min with a reaction rate constant of 0.348 min-1.},

abstract = {This work presents the performance of a SiO2-epoxy nanocomposite lining for the anticorrosion of the concrete structures in sewer networks. Nanocomposite lining on the concrete substrate surface of the 15 phr (part per hundred epoxy resin) amine-cured epoxy polymer containing 3.0 phr of nano-SiO2 was prepared by intercalating epoxy into the SiO2 via direct mixing process. The silica exfoliation was monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The barrier feature of epoxy the base nanocomposite against water and sulfuric acid solution was evaluated. The results showed that the nanocomposite lining was of a great barrier against these corrosive environments due to the intercalation and exfoliation caused by the dispersion of the SiO2 nanoparticles into the epoxy matrix. The rate of the H2SO4 into the nanocomposite lining was also investigated by measurement of the depth of the sulfur element penetrated layer using the coupled Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Deterioration behavior of the adhesion strength of the nanocomposite lining was studied. The nanocomposite lining shows a significant improvement of bond strength in comparison to the neat epoxy lining. The durability of the nanocomposite lining adhesion when the lining systems exposed to water and the sulfuric acid solution is also improved significantly.},

abstract = {Eutrophication is one of the most adverse impacts of nutrient contamination of water bodies where the phosphate is considered to be the primary limiting factor. The vaterite polymorph of porous calcium carbonate nanoparticles (VPCCNPs) were synthesized and used to remove orthophosphate ions in water. In this study, the VPCCNPs were synthesized chemically, using calcium acetate and sodium bicarbonate in a water-ethylene glycol media, at a temperature of 100°C, in a reaction time of 24 hours. Synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffractometry to confirm that the crystalline phase of calcium carbonate formed is spherical vaterite polymorph. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis further confirms the spherical shape of the vaterite nanoparticles and the presence of only calcium, carbon, and oxygen thus showing high purity of the synthesized calcium carbonate nanoparticles. The dynamic laser light scattering-based particle size analysis (DLS) shows the average particle size to be 25.5 nm. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to find functional groups before and after the adsorption of phosphate by vaterite nanoparticles. The phosphate removal efficiency of synthesized nanoparticles was tested with different concentrations of phosphate solutions (2–80 mg/L), pH levels (5–12), adsorbent dosages (0.025–0.250 g), and contact times (5–120 min). Ion chromatography was used to analyse the phosphate concentrations in water samples. The maximum phosphate removal percentage of 100% was obtained with 50 mL of 2 mg/L phosphate solution and 0.15 g of the synthesized nanoparticle. Adsorption data were well fitted with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with R2 of 0.99 and 0.98 (rate constant -0.083 g g-1 min-1), respectively. The presence of F−, NO3−, and SO42− has no effect on phosphate adsorption since 100% phosphate removal is obtained in the presence of these ions. Furthermore, the particle shows a 100% removal of orthophosphate ions available in eutrophic water regardless of the presence of many other ions in natural water bodies. The study presents a viable option for removing excess phosphate in natural water to desirable levels as a means for controlling eutrophication.},

In this work, we report the BPA separation properties of truly low-cost kaolin-based visible light-activated photocatalytic hollow fiber membranes. The ceramic hollow fiber support was successfully fabricated by phase inversion and sintering method, whereas Ag@TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared by liquid impregnation method. Different factors that affected the BPA removal were thoroughly investigated, including Ag loading in TiO2 catalyst and immersion time during dip coating method. A reference BPA (10 mgl-1) was used to check the photocatalytic performance of Ag@TiO2 photocatalysts and prepared membranes. Comprehensive characterization including X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX/S), Brunner-Emmer-Teller (BET), and UV-Vis spectroscopy revealed altered morphological and physicochemical properties of the photocatalytic membrane. UV-Vis results exhibited that the extended absorption edge of Ag@TiO2 photocatalyst was observed into the visible region that led to its maximum BPA removal of 93.22% within 180 min under visible light irradiation. The FESEM images of the prepared membranes evinced a significant change in the structural morphologies, and UV-Vis showed the absorption edge in the visible region owing to the coating of the Ag@TiO2 photocatalyst on the surface of the membrane. The resultant membrane showed a significant photocatalytic performance in the degradation of BPA (90.51% within 180 min) in an aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. At inference, the prepared membrane can be considered a promising candidate for efficient removal of BPA.},

NPs of TiO2 were biosynthesized at different volume compositions of titanium tetrabutoxide to the plant extract with a ratio of 1 : 2, 1 : 1, and 2 : 1, respectively. These green synthesized NPs of TiO2 were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. TGA/DTA analysis has confirmed that the synthesized NPs of TiO2 were stable above the temperature of 500°C. The sharp and intense peaks at 2θ values of 25.3, 38.0, 47.9, 53.2, 54.8862, 62.7, 70.2, and 75.0 have confirmed formation of crystalline NPs of TiO2 in the sample of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 ratios, and less crystalline samples for TiO2 NPs prepared in a 1 : 2 ratio. Comparison between FT-IR absorption bands of the plant extract and that of calcined NPs of TiO2 confirmed the purity of synthesized nanomaterials, except unavoidable adsorption of moisture on the surface of TiO2 NPs in an open air. The antibacterial activity of biosynthesized TiO2 NPs and that of ethanolic root extract of Kniphofia foliosa was investigated via the disc diffusion method against human pathogen bacteria strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Among the different ratios, TiO2 (1 : 1) NP shows better performance towards Gram-negative bacteria due to its smaller average crystalline size and uniform morphology observed in SEM image relative to the other two ratios of TiO2 NPs. Antibacterial activity of the ethanolic root extract of Kniphofia foliosa itself showed better performance towards Gram-negative bacteria than NPs of TiO2 that might be due to antibacterial activity of residue of ethanol left with the plant extract.},

The results show that the particle size of siphon-refined CL-20 is about 800 nm~1 μm, which is more smooth, mellow, and dense than that of CL-20 prepared by a traditional pressure-refined method. The peak diffraction angle of pressure- and siphon-refined CL-20 is basically the same as that of raw CL-20, and their crystal forms are ε type. The peak strength of pressure- and siphon-refined CL-20 decreased obviously. The apparent activation energy of pressure-refined CL-20 and siphon-refined CL-20 is 13.3 kJ/mol and 11.95 kJ/mol higher than that of raw CL-20, respectively. The thermal stability of CL-20 is improved. The activation enthalpy (ΔH#) is significantly higher than that of raw CL-20, and the characteristic drop is 70.4% and 82.7% higher than that of raw CL-20. The impact sensitivity of siphon-refined CL-20 is lower than that of pressure-refined CL-20, so the safety performance of an explosive is improved obviously.},

Optimization of reaction parameters for the gold nanoparticles was also investigated. Various analytical techniques were employed as part of the process of characterizing the resulting gold nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis revealed that the phenol compounds present in the extract were responsible for gold(III) reduction and stabilization of gold nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the gold nanoparticles were spherical in shape with an average diameter of 11 nm. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicated that the green synthesis approach produced highly crystalline, face-centered cubic gold nanoparticles. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements confirmed the presence of elemental gold in the prepared nanoparticles. The negative zeta potential value of gold nanoparticles was found to be -30.28 mV. The green synthesized gold nanoparticles expressed effective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii and exhibited an excellent catalytic property in terms of its reduction ability of methylene blue.},

abstract = {Structural optimization searches for the optimal shape and topology of
components such that specific physical quantities are optimized,
for instance, the stability of the resulting structure.
Problems involving multiple scales, i.e., structures on a microscopic and a macroscopic level,
can be efficiently solved by homogenization-based two-scale approaches.
In each optimization iteration, many computationally expensive tensors $E$
describing the macroscopic behavior of a given microstructure have to be calculated,
implying that the solution of one optimization problem
can take weeks.
The computational complexity can be greatly reduced
with surrogates $tilde{E}$
that are constructed in advance in an offline phase via interpolation and
that can be reused for different scenarios.
Three main issues arise in this context:
First, the curse of dimensionality renders conventional interpolation schemes
infeasible even for moderate dimensionalities $&gt; 4$.
Therefore, we use sparse grid interpolation combined with a novel
problem-tailored boundary treatment to drastically reduce the
necessary grid size with only slightly higher approximation errors.
Second, common sparse grid bases are not continuously differentiable.
Hierarchical B-splines achieve lower approximation errors and supply
exact continuous gradients of $tilde{E}$,
which enables gradient-based optimization without
approximating gradients of $E$.
Third, the interpolated tensors are usually required to be
positive definite, which is not fulfilled by common interpolation methods.
We are able to preserve positive definiteness of the interpolated
tensors by interpolating Cholesky factors instead.
Combining these three contributions allows computing optimized structures
for two- and three-dimensional optimization scenarios with speedups of up to
86 when compared to non-surrogate-based solutions.},

constraints that account for local microstructure geometry, conservation of Burgers
vectors, and thermal-kinetic limitations on disconnection fluxes. We present an analysis of

Herein, a centered miniature rotation robot under microscopy is presented to achieve multi-directional imaging of small objects. First, the miniature rotatable robot is constructed by three nano motors, including one rotational and two linear-motors. Then, a new centering strategy of neighborhood-window difference is proposed to center the micro/nano sample onto the rotation axis of the robot (error less than 20 pixels). In experiments, the sample is tested to be imaged from multi-direction (360°) by rotating the robot continuously. To highlight the versatility of this system, we demonstrate the multi-directional imaging under both optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Compared with current techniques, this system is able to provide richer morphology information at small scale benefiting from the multi-directional imaging, which is expected to have long-term impacts on microscopy observation, micro defect inspection, nanomaterial characterization and other related fields.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) based nanotechnology has been widely implemented in various fields for decades in light of its overwhelming advantages, such as nanometer spatial resolution, adaptability to liquid ambient, and various nanomechanical/electrical metrological approaches. It is noted that though AFM possesses imaging capability up to nanometer resolution, it is hard to achieve nanometer level positioning precision due to the existing system variability, especially the thermal drift, which distorts AFM images through relatively long capturing time. Since an AFM image is typically utilized as a global reference map to navigate its tip to the desired locations for precise measurement and manipulation, the system variability distorted image will definitely diversify the experimental results. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the positioning variability for better experimental results evaluation and decision-making. Although various approaches were proposed to evaluate AFM positioning error, to our best knowledge, there is little research about characterizing its positioning variability precisely and systematically. In this study, we present a universal metrological approach to quantitatively measure AFM tip locating variability by developing a featureless spiral local scan strategy together with the non-vector space (NVS) navigation approach. As a demonstration, the proposed nanometrology was conducted on a specific AFM platform to unravel its positioning property.},

abstract = {Motivated by the task of 2D classification in single particle reconstruction by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we consider the problem of heterogeneous multireference alignment of images. In this problem, the goal is to estimate a (typically small) set of target images from a (typically large) collection of observations. Each observation is a rotated, noisy version of one of the target images. For each individual observation, neither the rotation nor which target image has been rotated are known. As the noise level in cryo-EM data is high, clustering the observations and estimating individual rotations is challenging. We propose a framework to estimate the target images directly from the observations, completely bypassing the need to cluster or register the images. The framework consists of two steps. First, we estimate rotation-invariant features of the images, such as the bispectrum. These features can be estimated to any desired accuracy, at any noise level, provided sufficiently many observations are collected. Then, we estimate the images from the invariant features. Numerical experiments on synthetic cryo-EM datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Ultimately, we outline future developments required to apply this method to experimental data.},

abstract = {Tumor budding is defined as the presence of single tumor cells or small tumor clusters (less than five cells) that ‘bud’ from the invasive front of the main tumor. Tumor budding (TB) has recently emerged as an important adverse prognostic factor for many different cancer types. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), tumor budding has been independently associated with lymph node metastasis and poor outcome. Pathologic assessment of tumor budding by light microscopy requires close evaluation of tumor invasive front on intermediate to high power magnification, entailing locating the ‘hotspot’ of tumor budding, counting all TB in one high power field, and generating a tumor budding score. By automating these time-consuming tasks, computer-assisted image analysis tools can be helpful for daily pathology practice, since tumor budding reporting is now recommended on select cases. In this paper, we report our work on the development of a tumor budding detection system in CRC from whole-slide Cytokeratin AE1/3 images, based on de novo computer algorithm that automates morphometric analysis of tumor budding.},

After noting that such a view was generally assumed by the founders of AI in the 1950s, the argument proceeds by drawing on the distinction between science—in this case neuroscience—adopting a ‘telescopic’ or a ‘microscopic’ orientation to reality, depending on how it regards its characteristic investigative technologies. The paper concludes by recommending a ‘microscopic’ yet non-reductionist research agenda for neuroscience, in which the brain is seen as an underutilised organ whose energy efficiency is likely to outstrip that of the most powerful supercomputers for the foreseeable future.},

Through integration with current optical tools like the optical/confocal microscope, the 3D printing, the soft lithography, and the lithography–etching, microfluidic pore model offers a direct and visual way to study the process of geological related pore-scale transport phenomena. In this paper, recent progress of microfluidic pore model mimicking the geological porous media are discussed, which can apply on many disciplines such as environmental, petroleum engineering and geosciences. The purpose of this review is to highlight the significant features of microfluidic pore model application in geological porous medium pertaining research, as well as to provide engineer/scientist an overview of materials and fabrication methods to manufacture micromodels. Furthermore, the outlook of intensively using micromodel as a multifunction real-time analysis tool is proposed to help the reader to enhance their understanding of pore-scale transport phenomena related to geological porous medium. Also, potential critical issues of micromodels in both research and teaching are discussed. The overall role of this review for microfluidic application is intended to provide benefits to professors, students, and other scientists not only in research but also in teaching fields.},

abstract = {Differentiating objects separated by narrow gaps is a challenging and important task in analyzing microscopic images. These small separations provide useful information for applications that require detailed boundary information and/or an accurate particle count. We present a new approach to the modeling of these gaps based on a marked point process (MPP) framework. We propose to model narrow gaps as geometric structures called channels and define Gibbs energies for these models. The reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm embedded with simulated annealing is used as an optimization method, and the switching kernel in an RJMCMC is newly designed to speed up the algorithm. In this paper, we also propose a method to exploit a detected channel configuration to reduce bridging channel defects in conventional segmentation algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed channel modeling methods are successful in detecting gaps between closely adjacent objects. The results also show that the proposed interaction parameter control method improves boundary precision in the segmentation of microscopic images. The implementation of this method is available at &lt;uri&gt;https://engineering.purdue.edu/MASSI&lt;/uri&gt;.},

abstract = {Urine sediment examination refers to the use of microscopes to examine various tangible components in urine sediment, e.g. red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), tube, and crystal, etc., having a very important role in infectious diseases and circulatory diseases diagnosis. The traditional method about urine sediment analysis depends on the observation of medical staffs. So the workload is particularly large and inefficient, and relevant staff need to own some experience. Recently, the automation of urine sediment analysis can be realized. However, due to the complexity of the urine sediment microscopic image, the accuracy and efficiency of the automatic recognition for the tangible components are still very low. To solve this problem, we investigate channel features to urine sediment detection which include diverse feature types like color channel features and gradient magnitude, etc. We propose aggregate channel features plus (ACF+) detector which is based on aggregate channel features (ACF) for urine sediment detection. We adopt improved Adaboost classifier. The input image does not require any preprocessing and the specific ingredients such as RBCs can be detected directly with a high precision and efficiency. On the testing set, our proposed ACF+ detector suppresses several competitive baselines e.g. Support Vector Machine (SVM) combined with Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), vanilla ACF, and ACDS. In terms of speed, it runs 3FPS on 2592 \texttimes{} 2048 images.},

abstract = {Fitting Gaussian functions to empirical data is a crucial task in a variety of scientific applications, especially in image processing. However, most of the existing approaches for performing such fitting are restricted to two dimensions and they cannot be easily extended to higher dimensions. Moreover, they are usually based on alternating minimization schemes which benefit from few theoretical guarantees in the underlying nonconvex setting. In this paper, we provide a novel variational formulation of the multivariate Gaussian fitting problem, which is applicable to any dimension and accounts for possible nonzero background and noise in the input data. The block multiconvexity of our objective function leads us to propose a proximal alternating method to minimize it in order to estimate the Gaussian shape parameters. The resulting FIGARO algorithm is shown to converge to a critical point under mild assumptions. The algorithm shows a good robustness when tested on synthetic datasets. To demonstrate the versatility of FIGARO, we also illustrate its excellent performance in the fitting of the point spread functions of experimental raw data from a two-photon fluorescence microscope.},

abstract = {Skin rejuvenation is the most popular topic in cosmetic industry. Recently, skin phototherapy is spotlighted among a lot of skin therapies by its advantageous effects and ease of use. Phototherapy has been widely used for cosmeceutical purposes such as anti-aging or anti-bacterial effects. By the optical properties of light, however, the visible lights cannot reach deep inside the skin layer by reflection and scattering at the outermost boundary of the skin, the stratum corneum and epidermis. This paper describes new method to improve the skin phototherapy using microneedles. We used microneedle as the light transporter like optic fiber to transport light inside the skin by total internal reflection. The total internal reflection inside microneedles was geometrically analyzed and was measured microscopically. The light transmittance with or without a microneedle array was measured using an optical microscope system. Three different ranges of lights (red, green, blue) were exposed on the backside of the microneedle and the light pass through the microneedles. As the results, using microneedles, light transmissivity was dramatically improved even the shorter wavelength of the light (Blue light). Collaboration of phototherapy and microneedle will be a powerful cosmetic and medical tool for skin therapy.},

Numerical simulations often employ finite element models of representative volumes. Such models are based on observations of material microstructural properties, for example, by means of electron microscopy. Constructing a geometrical model of a representative volume for further computations can be a tedious task. This paper presents a new approach to creating geometrical models of this kind. The approach is based on the simulation of rigid body motion in a gravitational field and allows one to automatically generate geometrical models of representative volumes. The approach capabilities are exemplified by two geometrical models of representative volume.

abstract = {Ultrasonic wave generated by interaction of the material with pulsed lasers is known as photoacoustic (PA) wave. In this study, the PA imaging is applied to the nondestructive testing for carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP). When subsurface flaws are in CFRP, the detection of the flaws is sometimes challenging because the trailing signal from the surface interferes with the scattered signal from the flaws. Here, we developed a PA microscopy (PAM) to reconstruct the location and shape of the subsurface flaws. The PAM employs a confocal arrangement of optical and acoustic lens to maximize the intensity of generated PA waves. To enhance the lateral resolution of the image, we introduced the synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT). In the SAFT, it is necessary to consider direction‐dependent group velocities due to the strong anisotropy in CFRP. The performance of the PA imaging combined with the SAFT was checked with artificial delaminations in a cross‐ply CFRP specimen. It was shown that the PA wave had a wide frequency band and our method offered a high spatial resolution image.},

First, an imaging model-based microscopy image segmentation method is implemented for mitotic candidate extraction. Then, a new feature representation framework based on time series pooling is proposed for sequential events. At last, a support vector machine classifier is utilized for mitotic cell modeling and detection. Different from other feature representations including bag-of-visual-words when using identical underlying feature descriptors, this method can take advantage of temporal relations among frames, the idea is to keep track of how descriptor values are changing over time and summarize them to represent appearance in the cell sequence. The comparison experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The aim of this investigation is to study the motion of an elastically restrained beam used in tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM), which is to be utilized in manufacturing at nano-scale. TM-AFM uses high frequency oscillations to remove material or shape nano structures. Euler---Bernoulli theory and Eringen's theory of non-local continuum are used to model the nano machining structure composed of a nanobeam and a single degree of freedom, spring-mass system. The system is modelled as a beam with a torsional spring boundary condition that is rigidly restrained in the transverse direction at one end; and at the free end is a transverse linear spring attached to the tip. The other end of the spring is attached to a mass, resulting in a single degree of freedom spring-mass system. When the linear spring constant is infinite, the free end behaves as a beam with a concentrated tip mass. When the mass is infinite, the boundary condition is that of a linear spring. When the tip mass is zero, the configuration is that of a torsionally restrained-free beam. The motion of the tip of the beam and tip mass can be investigated to observe the tip frequency response, displacement and force. The tip displacement frequency contains information about the maximum displacement amplitude and therefore the sample penetration depth.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report a system that uses a microsphere to induce a photonic nanojet to directly write on a sample surface with sub-diffraction limit resolution, while simultaneously observing the writing processing in situ. Because of diffraction limit, sub-wavelength laser processing resolution has been difficult to achieve. Recently, we have shown that a microsphere-induced photonics nanojet could be used to create an optical light spot size beyond the diffraction limits, i.e., the diameter of the light spot could be reduced to −200 nm or smaller. This capability could allow a laser (with significant reduction in input power) to pattern nano-scale structures on various substrate materials through the use of microspheres. Many researchers have attempted to use this photonic nanojet (PNJ) based technique to process sub-diffraction limit patterns on all types of materials. However, applying this method to process features at precise locations is very difficult, because the technique requires that a sample being “cut” by the PNJ be observed by a common optical microscope, which cannot resolve features smaller than the optical diffraction limit. This disadvantage limits the applicability of this novel method to nano-scale processing; for example, in trimming resistors in an integrated circuit chip, many circuit components on the chip are much smaller than 200 nm, and not being able to see features beyond the diffraction limit will inadvertently destroy many components while PNJ is used to trim resistive elements. We will show in this paper that processing resolution better than 200 nm is achievable using our laser-based photonic nanojet method, whereas a simultaneous imaging resolution of less than λ/2 could be obtained. Therefore, the method presented in this paper has potential applications in processing sub-diffraction features and bio-specimens in real time with optical information feedback.},

The subsequent stages involved: contrast enhancement, adaptive thresholding and false detection reduction. This method was tested using 48 MSCs images and the results were evaluated by a specialist.

abstract = {Modelling of congestion control mechanisms of the transmission control protocol (TCP) helps to obtain parametric results that help to better understand the TCP behaviour under different operating conditions. Several analytical models were proposed to analyse the behaviour of TCP congestion control mechanisms. However, most of these models were designed for a few TCP sessions with non-persistent connections. A few analytical studies were presented for modelling persistent TCP connections. Nevertheless, these studies have many limiting assumptions and are not scalable. In this work, a stochastic reward nets model is introduced for the TCP Reno with the persistent TCP connections, which share two bottleneck links in a wide area network. A microscopic approach was used for constructing the proposed model that captures most features of congestion control mechanisms used by the TCP Reno, and interactions between different TCP sessions. The proposed model relaxed several limiting assumptions adopted by other related models introduced in the literature. To validate the proposed model, analytical results are extensively compared with simulation results.},

In this study, silver nanostructures were synthesized using different sugar substitutes and artificial sweeteners as green reducing agents in an aqueous solution at low temperature. The main ingredients (such as maltodextrin, sucrose, saccharin, and sucralose) of the artificial sweeteners acting as reducing agents were used to reduce Ag+ ions to Ag0. The pH of the solution was controlled during synthesis through the addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to increase the strength of the reducing agents by converting nonreducing sugars to reducing ones and consequently increasing the rate of silver nanoparticle formation. The size and morphology of the synthesized nanostructures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The formation of nanostructures during the course of the reactions was investigated by UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy characterization of an aliquot of sample at specific intervals. The function of each artificial sweetener and corresponding ingredients as a reducing agent and capping agent was investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and mass spectrometry (MS).},

The structural and light emission properties of “SiO2+Sn-based nanocluster” composites have been studied using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy in cross section and plan-view geometry, electron microdiffraction, and photoluminescence (PL). A strict correspondence of Sn concentration profiles and depth particle distributions has been found. In the case of 1\texttimes{}1017 cm−2 fluence, the impurity accumulation in the subsurface zone during the thermal treatment leads to swelling and to the formation of dendrites composed of large and coalesced nanoparticles of grey contrast. The appearance of dendrites is most probably due to the SnO2 phase formation. The as-implanted samples are characterized by a weak emission with maximum at the blue range (2.9 eV). The PL intensity increases by an order of magnitude after annealing in an oxidizing atmosphere. The narrowest and most intense PL band has maximum at 3.1 eV. Its intensity increases with increasing fluence and annealing temperature. This emission can be attributed to the formation of the SnO2 phase (in the form of separate clusters or shells of Sn clusters) in the subsurface region of the SiO2 matrix.},

abstract = {In this article, low density polyethylene was used as a matrix polymer. The ZnO particles with diameters of 30 nm and 1 μm were used as inorganic filler. The nano-ZnO particles after surface modification would disperse in the matrix uniformly. The nano-, micro-, and micro-/nano-ZnO/LDPE were prepared by melt blending. During the experiment, the microstructures of different composites were characterized and discussed by SEM and DSC. Besides, the micro- and nano-ZnO/LDPE underwent a breakdown test, conductance test, and dielectric spectrum test. The microscopic experimental results showed that the ZnO particles dispersed uniformly in the LDPE matrix. The crystallinity of composites was higher than that of pure LDPE. Among them, the maximum crystallinity was 39.77% when the nano-ZnO particle size was 30 nm. It was 16.1% higher than pure LDPE. The macroscopic experimental results showed that the effect of micro- and nano-ZnO particle doping on breakdown properties of polymers was different. Among them, the breakdown field strength of nano-ZnO/LDPE was the highest at 138.0 kV/mm, which was 8.24% higher than that of pure LDPE. The micro-/nano-ZnO/LDPE took second place, which was still higher than pure LDPE. As the thickness of samples increased, the thermal breakdown was the dominant factor in the breakdown test. The AC breakdown field strength of all composites tended to decrease, and the reduction of micro-ZnO/LDPE was lower than that of nano-ZnO/LDPE. Besides, the dispersion of the breakdown became better. Moreover, the micro- and nano-ZnO particle doping could improve the conductivity characteristic of polymer effectively. The dielectric constant and dielectric loss of composites increased with the increase of the particle size.},

abstract = {Dilute aqueous solutions of triblock copolymer Pluronic P103 were used to synthesize silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) by chemical reduction of silver nitrate (AgNO3) with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This copolymer was used as a structural agent since monomers act as a stabilizer and micelles act as nanoreactors for nucleation and growth of Ag-NPs. The growth of the nanoparticles (NPs) was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy on the basis of measuring surface plasmon resonance absorption over a temperature range of 25 to 70°C. Shape and size of hybrid silver/P103 nanomaterials were tuned by varying the micellar structure of Pluronic P103 using a simple synthesis procedure. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to study the size and shape of the hybrid nanomaterials. It was observed that Ag-NPs synthesized without Pluronic P103 at 25°C exhibited a great variety of sizes. However, when Pluronic P103 was used below its critical micellar concentration (CMC), spherical-shaped Ag-NPs with uniform size were formed, suggesting that the copolymer had a stabilizing effect. On the other hand, when Ag-NPs were prepared with Pluronic P103 above the CMC, NPs with similar sizes as the micelles were detected, suggesting that the copolymer functioned as a nanoreactor. Furthermore, as temperature reached 35°C, oval-shaped micelles were formed and small NPs were incorporated into the crown of the micelles. Independent Ag-NPs were not observed since they used the surface of the micelles as a soft template. Therefore, it was possible to obtain tiny Ag-NPs with homogeneous size.},

The prepared dual-drug loaded lipid nanoparticles with a uniform particle size distribution of 153.17±4.17 nm (PDI 0.191±0.017, zeta potential -20.93±1.75 mV), had a visible core-shell structure under transmission electron microscopy; the encapsulation efficiency of NCTD and Tet was 86.62% and 79.19%, respectively, with obvious in vitro sustained release characteristics. The cellular uptake results suggested that FA modification could enhance intracellular distribution of FA-LP@Tet/(MSNs@NCTD). Furthermore, cell apoptosis assays showed FA-LP@Tet/(MSNs@NCTD) had better antitumor ability via reversing multidrug resistance.

Two ways of mixing of the La(NO3)3, Pr(NO3)3, and NaF solutions (dropwise and swift addition) were used. One sample was subjected to microwave (MW) treatment for 30, 90, and 180 min. All the samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). For all the samples, optical spectroscopy experiments were carried out. The XRD data were analyzed via the Debye-Scherrer and Williamson-Hall methods. It was revealed that the way of mixing of the La(NO3)3, Pr(NO3)3, and NaF solutions strongly affects the shape of the NPs. The slow dropwise addition of the NaF solution leads to the plate-like NP (PLNP) formation; otherwise, the swift addition of the NaF solution leads to the formation of more sphere-like NPs (SLNPs). The size and regularity in shape of the NP increase with the increasing stoichiometric proportion of La(NO3)3, Pr(NO3)3, and NaF from 1 : 0.8 to 1 : 6. The size and regularity in shape of the SLNPs increase with the increasing time of MW treatment. The Debye-Scherrer and Williamson-Hall methods confirmed the anisotropic shape of the PLNPs. The Williamson-Hall method showed that the values of strain are almost similar for all the samples (around 14∗10-4). Optical spectroscopy experiments revealed that although all the samples have an equal chemical composition, the luminescence lifetimes for different samples differ between each other. The luminescence lifetime of the PLNPs is less than that of the SLNPs having an equal stoichiometric proportion of La(NO3)3, Pr(NO3)3, and NaF. The luminescence lifetime of the 1 : 1 SLNPs increases with the increasing time of MW treatment.},

Structural characterizations and thermal stability of the composites were systematically studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Moreover, safety performance was analyzed by qualitative testing of impact sensitivity and friction sensitivity. The XRD analysis demonstrated that HMX and CL-20 refined by SDAS maintained the crystal structure of β-HMX and ε-CL-20 before and after refinement, whereas the HMX crystal structure after spray recrystallization refinement was transformed from β-HMX to α-HMX. The DSC results indicated that the thermal decomposition peak temperature of the three particles refined by the SDAS technology had a minimum advancement, and the thermal stability of the particles was relatively superior. More importantly, the H50 of the RDX, HMX, and CL-20 refined by this novel method was increased to 48.3 cm, 44.6 cm, and 31.1 cm, and the probability of friction explosion was decreased to 62%, 62%, and 80%, respectively, thus significantly improving the safety performance as compared with the sample refined by spray recrystallization.},

abstract = {In this study, the maple wood surface was coated with nanostructured zinc oxide, grown on the surface by using a hydrothermal process, and furtherly treated with shellac varnish. Samples obtained both after ZnO treatment and after the final varnish application were characterized by different techniques, i.e., X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), micro-FTIR with attenuated total reflectance (μ-ATR-FTIR), chromatic variation measurements, and contact angle determinations. Analytical results showed that the wood surface was covered by quite a homogeneous array of inorganic nanoparticles and that the natural resin forms a regular film over the ZnO nanostructures. An accelerated aging test was used to evaluate the protecting effectiveness of the treatments towards UV-induced decay of wood material. After the test, wood treated with ZnO and with the shellac/ZnO combination underwent a considerably lower chromatic change if compared to the untreated wood, suggesting an enhanced resistance of the treated maple to the decay due to light exposition. The presence of nanostructured ZnO protects from decay not only the wood substrate but also the shellac film. A microbiology test showed that growth of fungal species, e.g., common mold, is prevented on the wood surface treated with ZnO or with shellac/ZnO, indicating that the nanostructured zinc oxide also provides an effective protection from biodeterioration. The coating obtained by consecutive application of nanosized ZnO particles and shellac varnish combines the excellent aesthetical features and water repellence of the traditional finish with the protecting effectiveness of the nanostructured inorganic component.},

abstract = {Magnetorheological fluid is a new type of smart material that is sensitive to magnetic fields and has controllable performance. It is widely regarded for its unique magnetorheological effect and good rheological properties. For materials, the microstructure determines its macroscopic properties. In order to better study its macroscopic properties, it is necessary to have a more comprehensive understanding and deep understanding of its microstructure. In this paper, the magnetization process of magnetorheological fluid is analyzed from a microscopic point of view. Based on Newton’s second law, the dynamic model of particle motion is established. The magnetic force, repulsive force, and viscous resistance of magnetic particles are analyzed. The finite difference numerical calculation method is used. The velocity-Verlet algorithm simulates the static microstructure chaining process of the magnetorheological fluid and the dynamic chaining process under shear force under different influencing factors. At the same time, a static observation device and a shear observation device were developed to observe the microstructure chaining morphology of magnetorheological fluid under different influencing factors, and to study the dynamic chaining law of magnetorheological fluid under the action of a shear force. Therefore, a reasonable contrast index is established, and the numerical simulation results are compared with the experimental observation results.},

abstract = {Nowadays, multifunctional materials are of high interest due to their ability to be used in different applications by controlling one or two parameters (e.g., morphology and/or dopant). Zinc oxide is an intensive-studied material because of its large usability. Recently, we have shown that the conduction, transparency, and charge carrier concentration of ZnO can be controlled by changing the dopants, leading to promising materials as transparent conductive oxide films. In this work, sol-gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) methods were used separately or in combination in order to obtain ZnO films doped with Mn (1, 2, and 5%) for possible application in transparent optoelectronics or as piezoelectric materials. The manganese (Mn) dopant in the form of anhydrous manganese acetate was used to obtain Mn-doped ZnO films. ZnO hydrothermal (HT) growth was made on a previously ZnO seed layer, formed by sol-gel method. The Mn-doped ZnO films were deposited on microscope glass and on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates. A comparative characterization of the films for their structure, morphology, and optical and piezoelectric properties was achieved. SG films exhibit equiaxed nanoparticles, with diameters around 50 nm, while the films prepared by HT show a homogeneous morphology consisting of uniform 1D nanorods, sized about 30 nm diameter and 200–300 nm length. XRD diffractograms evidenced the presence of zincite phase (wurtzite structure hexagonally close packed), with an improvement in crystallinity of the HT films (compared with SG ones), which present a stronger tendency to be oriented along (002) plane (c-axis) at 2% at Mn. Spectroscopic ellipsometry shows that the films obtained by SG are much thinner than the ones obtained by HT and that the refractive index is increasing with the percent of dopant. The band gap energy was found to decrease with the Mn doping level from 3.28 eV (undoped ZnO) to 3.10 eV (ZnO doped with 5 at% Mn) for the samples deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si. The maximum transmission is found for the undoped ZnO film and decreases with Mn concentration but remains over 78% in the visible range. From the piezoelectric tests, it was found that the d33 coefficient is much larger for the HT samples in comparison with the SG samples, especially for 2 and 5 at% Mn. The optical and piezoelectric results could be of interest for applications in optoelectronic or piezoelectric devices.},

Graphene oxide (GO) was produced from graphite by the modified Hummers method and thereafter reduced with NaBH4 or by heating under argon in a tubular furnace. The films were produced from aqueous solutions by vacuum filtration on a cellulose membrane. Graphite presents two characteristic XRD peaks corresponding to d=0.34 nm and d=0.17 nm. After oxidation, only a peak at d=0.84 nm is found for powder GO, confirming the insertion of oxygen groups with an increase in the interplanar distance of graphene nanoplatelets. However, for GO films, other unexpected peaks are observed at d=0.63 nm, d=0.52 nm, and d=0.48 nm. After reduction, both chemical and thermal, the peak at 0.84 nm disappears, while those corresponding to interplanar distances of 0.63 nm, 0.52 nm, and 0.48 nm are still present. The other characterizations confirm the production and chemical composition of GO and reduced GO films.

Native SLM titanium thus requires proper modifications to improve its bioactivity and antibacterial efficacy. Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) was conducted on sandblasted SLM substrate to form a microporous TiO2 coating. Subsequently, hydrothermal treatment was applied to fabricate micro-nano zinc-incorporated coatings with different Zn content (1 mM-Zn and 100 μM-Zn). Surface characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, a three-dimensional profilometer, and a contact angle measuring device. The osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1, Subclone 14, was used in cell viability assays to evaluate adhesion, proliferation, and ALP activity. An antibacterial assay was conducted using Streptococcus sanguinis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Zn-incorporated samples exhibited higher adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation than did SLM and MAO samples. 100 μM Zn samples exhibited the highest proliferation, and 1 mM-Zn samples manifested the highest ALP activity. In addition, Zn-incorporated samples exerted inhibitory effects on both Streptococcus sanguinis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Combining micro-arc oxidation and hydrothermal treatment, we successfully fabricated a novel Zn-incorporated coating on a microporous SLM surface which possesses both outstanding bioactivity and antibacterial efficacy.},

abstract = {One of the most effective strategies to improve the photoconversion efficiency in the photoelectrochemical cell is by using an assembly of heterostructures. To do so, a simple and inexpensive method, that is successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), is used to deposit the narrow band gap energy semiconductor Bi2S3 on ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) at different SILAR cycles. The obtained binary heterostructure thin films were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis Spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) to prove the crystal structure, optical properties, band gap energy, morphological structure, composition of elements, and electrical properties. The XRD revealed that ZnO NRAs possessed a single wurtzite crystal structure while Bi2S3 possessed an orthorhombic crystal structure. The as-fabricated Bi2S3/ZnO heterostructure exhibited enhanced visible light absorption and charge separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. The band gap energy of binary heterostructure Bi2S3/ZnO NRAs is 3.11, 3.00, 2.33, 1.96, and 1.89 eV at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 SILAR cycles, respectively, confirming the substantial improvement of ZnO NRA optical properties. The highest photocurrent density has been achieved by 1.92 mA/cm2 of Bi2S3/ZnO NRAs fabricated at 7 cycles, exhibiting sixfold enhancement compared to that of intrinsic ZnO NRAs (0.336 mA/cm2). This impressive enhancement was ascribed to the significant improvement in morphological structure, crystallinity, and optical properties of heterostructure photoanodes. Significant improvement was achieved in the photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) performance attributed to the fast separation, low recombination rate, and low impedance of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs as shown throughout the electrochemical impedance spectra.},

abstract = {The biogenesis of silver nanoparticles by fungi is an ecologically clean and nontoxic method compared to other physical and chemical methods. Thus, we aimed to discuss the mycosynthesis of extracellular size-controlled AgNPs. After comprehensive screening, Aspergillus fumigatus BTCB10 (KY486782) was selected for the synthesis of AgNPs of controlled size. Characterization was performed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer, Zetasizer, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) along with functional assays—antibacterial and MTT assays. Data suggested that under optimized conditions, i.e., temperature 25°C, AgNO3 concentration 1 mM, biomass 7 g, fungal culture age 7 days, pH 6, ratio of cell-free filtrate (CFF)/silver nitrate (3 : 2), NaCl 20%, and under dark light, the smallest size AgNPs of 0.681 nm with 100% monodispersity was obtained as evident by a zeta potential of -23.4 mV, UV-Vis band at 400 nm, and the presence of O-H and C=O groups confirmed by ATR-FTIR; XRD revealed the crystalline nature of AgNPs; additionally, cube-shaped AgNPs were revealed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Moreover, synthesized AgNPs exhibited antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, notably, Klebsiella pneumoniae BTCB04, Acinetobacter BTCB05, Pseudomonas aeruginosa BTCB01, and Escherichia coli BTCB03, while maximum 7-fold was observed with Acinetobacter BTCB05. AgNPs demonstrated no cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cells; however, in combination with cisplatin, antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects became more evident and significant in comparison to control and as single agent. Taken together, the data suggested that economical and smallest size AgNPs can be biosynthesized from Aspergillus fumigatus BTCB10 and be used as antibacterial and antiproliferative agents in combination with current drugs against clinically relevant multiple drug-resistant bacterial and tumoral cells. Further studies are required to confirm their effects employing in vivo disease models.},

abstract = {Carbon dots represent a kind of fluorescent nanomaterial and have broad application prospects in the field of biosensing and optoelectronics. Here, we explored carbon dots with a high-fluorescence quantum yield rate synthesized from L-cysteine and citric acid by the microwave-assisted method. The characteristics of the carbon dots were studied using a transmission electron microscope, an X-ray diffractometer, X-ray photoelectron spectra, a UV-Vis absorption spectrometer, a FTIR spectrometer, and a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The obtained carbon dots exhibited a high-fluorescence quantum yield (up to 85%), which is due to the combination of amidogens and sulfydryl with carbon dots, and hence bring the improved fluorescence property. We used carbon dots for in vitro imaging of CRL-5822 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which showed the low inhibitory rate (0.8%) of cells for 48 h with good biocompatibility demonstrated by the cell viability assay. The image of cells can be observed clearly under UV light. The Stern-Volmer equation was introduced to describe the quenching effect between the fluorescence intensity of carbon dots and the concentration of aqueous dopamine (DA).},

By adjusting the amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, and 1.20 wt%) with the PbTiO3, we constructed various photocatalysts for this investigation. The crystal structure and morphology of the various composites were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Photoelectron spectroscopic study revealed that the band structure of the newly formed composites and efficient charge separation can be obtained by the interfaces of various rGO content. In addition, the photocatalytic performance of the synthesized composites was explored by H2 evolution and rhodamine blue (RhB) degradation. The obtained results indicated that the addition of the appropriate amount of rGO could improve the activity of pure PbTiO3, significantly.},

Results showed that the synthesized ZnO materials were porous nanosheets with a smooth surface and a thickness of 100 nm and a large pore size of approximately 80 nm. The as-prepared nanosheets, which had high purity, high crystallinity, and good dispersion, were used to fabricate a gas sensor for ethanol gas detection at different operating temperatures. The porous ZnO nanosheet gas sensor exhibited a high response value of 21 toward 500 ppm ethanol at a working temperature of 400°C with a reversible and fast response to ethanol gas (12 s/231 s), indicating its potential application.

abstract = {Mitochondria, as dynamic organelles, are precisely regulated by fusion and fission. The dynamic balance of fusion and fission controls mitochondrial morphology and their subcellular location and function. Exposure to titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) may cause serious health problems. However, how TiO2 NPs affect the mitochondrial dynamics remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the changes of mitochondrial dynamics in the TiO2NPs-treated HT22 cells by confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. The confocal images demonstrated obvious changes in the average length and density of the mitochondria after TiO2 NPs treatment, while STED images further obtained the nanoscale submitochondrial structures of the mitochondria under TiO2 NPs insult. The fluorescence intensity distributions suggested that mitochondria fragmented in the TiO2 NPs-treated cells. TiO2 NPs treatment caused mitochondrial dynamic imbalance due to the imbalanced expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1). Furthermore, we examined the levels of oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which revealed the damage of mitochondria under TiO2 NPs exposure. Meanwhile, the significant changes of expressions of B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cytochrome c (Cyt C), and caspase 9 demonstrated that TiO2 NPs treatment activated the mitochondrial-related apoptosis pathway. These cellular events can be largely prevented via cell incubation with mitoTEMPO, a mitochondria-targeted superoxide scavenger. Our results confirm that TiO2 NPs targeted the mitochondria, inducing mitochondrial dynamic imbalance and damage in HT22 cells. Our study provides an insightful understanding of the mechanisms underlying TiO2 NPs cytotoxicity.},

Carbon nanofibers obtained by carbonization of the PAN nanofibers to 1000°C (electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNF)) were additionally oxidized in air at 800°C under reduced pressure (electrospun carbon nanofibers oxidized under reduced pressure (ECNFV)). The oxidative treatment led to partial removal of a structurally less-ordered carbon phase from the near-surface region of the carbon nanofibers. Both types of carbon fibrous mats were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. The morphology, microstructure, and surface properties of both materials were analyzed. The oxidative treatment of carbon nanofibers significantly changed their surface morphology and physical properties (wettability, surface electrical resistance). Biological tests (genotoxicity, fibroblast, and human osteoblast-like MG63 cultures) were carried out in contact with both materials. Genotoxicity study conducted by means of comet assays revealed significant differences between both carbon nanofibers. Fibroblasts contacted with the as-received carbon nanofibers (ECNF) showed a significantly higher level of DNA damage compared to control and oxidized carbon nanofibers (ECNFV). The ECNFV nanofibers were not cytotoxic, whereas ECNF nanofibers contacted with both types of cells indicated a cytotoxic effect. The ECNFV introduced into cell culture did not affect the repair processes in the cells contacting them.},

Formation of nanoparticles was monitored using UV-Visible spectroscopy at different time intervals. A maximum absorption at 456 nm was observed as the reaction time increased, resulting in a red shift of the surface plasmon band (SPB). Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed the reducing and stabilizing activity of flavonoids, coumarins, tannins, and phenols.

Mixers play a crucial role in particle fabrication in continuous-flow systems. In this study, a Center T-Mixer and a Collision Cross-Mixer are developed and implemented in a hot water fluidized suspension reaction (HWFSR) system. The influence of the resident time on the particle phase and size was evaluated, and properties of particles derived from systems equipped with differing mixers were compared. The resulting particles were characterized using techniques of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). When compared with the Center T-Mixer, results indicate that the Collision Cross-Mixer has better control regarding the morphology and size distribution of resulting particles while improving the transition temperatures of the as-synthesized materials. HWFSR systems containing novel mixer designs are capable of producing pure M-phase VO2 particles in a single step contrary to the current reactor design that use a second postheat treatment step, and they are capable of synthesizing many other nanoparticle species, especially those requiring high temperature and pressure reaction conditions.},

The present study is a report of biosynthesizing AgNPs using Chlorophytum borivilianum L. (Safed musli) callus extract as a novel source of reducing agent. AgNO3 solution challenged with the methanolic callus extract displayed a change in color from yellow to brown owing to the bioreduction reaction. Further, AgNPs were characterized by using UV–visible spectrophotometry, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). UV–vis spectrum revealed the surface plasmon resonance property of AgNPs at around 450 nm. XRD pattern with typical peaks indicated the face-centered cubic nature of silver. AFM analysis confirmed the existence of spherical-shaped and well-dispersed AgNPs having an average size of 52.0 nm. Further, FTIR analysis confirmed the involvement of different phytoconstituents of the callus extract role in the process of bioreduction to form nanoparticles. The AgNPs were more efficient in inhibiting the tested pathogenic microbes, namely, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Methicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans compared to callus extract. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay confirmed the cytotoxic property of AgNPs against human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29) in a dose-dependent manner. At higher concentrations of 500 μg/mL AgNPs, the cell viability was observed to be only 7% after 24 hours with IC50 value of 254 μg/mL. Therefore, these AgNPs clearly endorse the manifold potential to be used in various biomedical applications in the near future.},

TEM results indicated that the diameters of the as-prepared nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots were in the range of 2 - 5 nm and the lattice space is about 0.276 nm; Raman spectrum result indicated that there were two characteristic peaks, generally named D (~1408 cm−1) and G (~1640 cm−1) bands; both TEM and Raman spectrum results indicated that the as-synthesized product was graphene quantum dots. Deconvoluted high resolution XPS spectra for C1s, O1s, and N1s results indicated that there are -NH-, -COOH, and -OH groups on the surface of nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot. Fluorescence emission spectrum indicated that the maximum fluorescence emission spectrum of nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots was blue shift about 30.1 nm and the average fluorescence decay time of nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots increased about 2 ns, compared with graphene quantum dots without doping of nitrogen. Then, the as-prepared nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots were used to quantitatively analyze brilliant blue based on the fluorescent quenching of graphene quantum dots, and the effect of pH and reaction time on this fluorescent quenching system was also obtained. Under selected condition, the linear regression equations were F0/F=0.0087 (brilliant blue) + 0.9553 and F0/F=0.01205 (brilliant blue) + 0.6695, and low detection limit was 3.776 μmol/L (3.776 nmol/mL). Once more diluted N-GQDs (0.05 mg/mL) were used, the low detection limit could reach 94.87 nmol/L. Then, temperature-dependent experiment, absorbance spectra, and dynamic fluorescence quenching rate constant were used to study the quenching mechanism; all results indicated that this quenching process was a static quenching process based on the formation of complex between nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots and brilliant blue through hydrogen bond. Particularly, this method was used to quantitatively analyze the wine sample, of which results have a high consistence with the results of the spectrophotometric method; demonstrating this fluorescence quenching method could be used in practical sample application.},

abstract = {In this study, chitosan nanocomposite thin films were successfully fabricated by incorporating hematite nanoparticles (HNPs) and akaganeite nanoparticles (ANPs) as reinforcing fillers using the solution casting method. HNPs and ANPs were synthesized via a urea-assisted synthesis route using naturally occurring ferruginous laterites. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images indicated the spherical to subhexagonal morphology of the HNPs and rice-like morphology of the ANPs. X-ray diffractograms indicate the crystalline structure of iron oxides as hematite and akaganeite. Tensile tests were carried out to evaluate the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite films where maximum tensile stress of the chitosan/HNP composites was improved as high as 35.7% while chitosan/ANP composites indicated 43.5%. Thermal decomposition curves obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicate that the thermal stability of the nanocomposites has improved remarkably compared to neat chitosan films. Furthermore, these nanocomposites exhibited excellent UV barrier properties as identified by UV-visible spectrometry. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic results are evident in the presence of Fe-O bond in the wavenumber around 480-500 cm-1, and the result also indicated that the nanofillers interact with the chitosan matrix via hydrogen bonding, which enhanced the physical properties of the nanocomposites. Incorporation of iron oxide nanoparticle varieties into chitosan has led to improvements of certain physical and chemical properties, which make chitosan a promising material for packaging applications.},

abstract = {ZnO-ZrO2 nanocomposites using zinc (II) acetylacetonate and different ZnO contents (13, 25, 50, and 75% mol) were synthesized through sol-gel method. The synthesis process was strongly related to nanocomposite properties especially on their structural composition. The obtained ZnO-ZrO2 nanomaterials presented tetragonal crystalline structure for zirconia whereas hexagonal one was formed in ZnO. Raman spectroscopy and XRD patterns confirmed the formation of tetragonal zirconia whereas inhibition of monoclinic structure was observed. Addition of ZnO affected the pore size distribution of the composite, and the measured specific surface areas were from 10 m2/g (for pure ZnO) to 46 m2/g (pristine ZrO2). Eg values of ZrO2 were modified by ZnO addition, since calculated values using Kubelka-Munk’s function varied from 4.73 to 3.76 eV. The morphology and size of the nanomaterials investigated by electron microscopy showed formation of nanorods for ZnO with sizes ranging from 50 nm to 300 nm while zirconia was formed by smaller particles (less than 50 nm). The main advantage of using the nanocomposite for photocatalytic degradation of phenol was the mineralization degree, since 75ZnO-ZrO2 nanocomposite surpassed mineralization reached by pure ZnO and also inhibited formation of undesirable intermediates.},

We consider a unidirectional flow of pedestrians in a corridor and assume that the velocity decreases with the average density according to the fundamental diagram. Our model is formed from a coupling between a density dependent stochastic differential equation and a nonlinear partial differential equation for the density, and is hence of McKean--Vlasov type. We discuss identifiability of the parameters appearing in the fundamental diagram from  trajectories of individuals, and we introduce optimization and Bayesian methods to perform the identification. We  analyze the performance of the developed methodologies in various situations, such as for different in- and outflow conditions, for varying numbers of individual trajectories, and for differing channel geometries.},

abstract = {In traditional optical imaging systems, the spatial resolution  is limited by the physics of diffraction, which acts as a low-pass filter.
The information on subwavelength features is carried by evanescent waves, never reaching the camera, thereby posing a hard limit on resolution: the so-called diffraction limit. Modern microscopic methods enable super-resolution, by employing fluorescence techniques.
State-of-the-art localization based fluorescence subwavelength imaging techniques such as PALM and STORM achieve subdiffraction spatial resolution of several tens of nanometers. However, they require tens of thousands of exposures, which limits their temporal resolution.
We have recently proposed sparsity based super-resolution correlation microscopy (SPARCOM), which exploits the sparse nature of the fluorophore distribution, alongside a statistical prior of uncorrelated emissions, and showed that SPARCOM achieves spatial resolution comparable to PALM/STORM, while capturing the data hundreds of times faster. Here, we provide
a detailed mathematical formulation of SPARCOM, which in turn leads to an efficient numerical implementation, suitable for large-scale problems. We further extend our method to a general framework for sparsity based super-resolution imaging, in which sparsity can be assumed in other domains such as wavelet or discrete-cosine, leading to improved reconstructions in a variety of physical settings.},

abstract = {Kymographs are widely used to represent and analyze spatio-temporal dynamics of fluorescence markers along curvilinear biological compartments. These objects have a singular geometry, and thus kymograph reconstruction is inherently an analog image processing task. However, the existing approaches are essentially digital: the kymograph photometry is sampled directly from the time-lapse images. As a result, such kymographs rely on raw image data that suffer from the degradations entailed by the image formation process and the spatio-temporal resolution of the imaging setup. In this paper, we address these limitations and introduce a well-grounded Bayesian framework for the analog reconstruction of kymographs. To handle the movement of the object, we introduce an intrinsic description of kymographs using differential geometry: a kymograph is a photometry defined on a parameter space that is embedded in physical space by a time-varying map that follows the object geometry. We model the kymograph photometry as a L\'{e}vy innovation process, a flexible class of non-parametric signal priors. We account for the image formation process using the virtual microscope framework. We formulate a computationally tractable representation of the associated maximum a posteriori problem and solve it using a class of efficient and modular algorithms based on the alternating split Bregman. We assess the performance of our Bayesian framework on synthetic data and apply it to reconstruct the fluorescence dynamics along microtubules in vivo in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that our framework allows revealing patterns from single time-lapse data that are invisible on standard digital kymographs.},

Three different types of patterns (linear patterns, square patterns and dot patterns) were fabricated on the silicon wafers and the surface morphology of various patterns were observed by optical microscope. Then the effects of LWD parameters and interval parameters on surface wettability were studied by measuring the values of the contact angles (always written in CA). Additionally, the relationships between the LWD parameters, interval parameters and the two-dimensional anisotropic properties after the salinization process were also studied in this paper. This method may play a significant role in academic and industrial applications regarding to the functional surfaces, microfluidic devices, micro-electronics and so on.},

Herein, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were exfoliated from graphite material under vacuum and low temperature and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results revealed that the obtained rGO is morphologically well structured in the size ranges of 1---3 µm and smooth. An apparent reduction of O1s with XPS analysis was noticed. The crystalline nature of rGO was evidenced by (0 0 2) and (0 0 4) orientations. FTIR has generated clear peak stretches at 1018, 1092 and 1628 cm\'{y}1. Further, UV---visible and Raman spectroscopic optical analyses displayed the apparent peak profiles at appropriate positions. The appearance of G and D bands with the respective G/D ratio of peak intensity in Raman analysis aids to estimate D/G to be ~\'{y}0.8. The calculated ratio with 2D/G is to be 1.7 with a single layer of graphene. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated that rGO can be obtained simply by vacuum assisted a low thermal exfoliation.},

abstract = {Phase Contrast and Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy are two popular noninvasive techniques for monitoring live cells. Each of these two imaging modalities has its own advantages and disadvantages to visualize specimens, so biologists need these two complementary modalities together to analyze specimens. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven learning method capable of transferring microscopy images from one imaging modality to the other imaging modality, reflecting the characteristics of specimens from different perspectives. For example, given a Phase Contrast microscope, we can transfer its images to the corresponding DIC images without using DIC microscope, vice versa. The preliminary experiments demonstrate that the image transfer approach can provide biologists a computational way to switch between microscopy imaging modalities, so biologists can combine the advantages of different imaging modalities to better visualize and analyze specimens over time, without purchasing all types of microscopy imaging modalities or switching between imaging systems back-and-forth during time-lapse experiments.},

abstract = {The tracking of plant cells in large-scale microscopy image sequences is very challenging, because plant cells are densely packed in a specific honeycomb structure, and the microscopy images can be randomly translated, rotated and scaled in the imaging process. This paper proposes a multi-seed dynamic local graph matching method to track the plant cells across unregistered microscopy image sequences, by exploiting the geometric structure and topology of cells' relative positions as contextual information. The proposed dynamic cell matching scheme always selects the most similar cell pair in the dynamically growing neighbor set of matched cells, so it tends to prevent the matching error accumulation during the cell correspondence growing process. Furthermore, the multi-seed-based majority voting scheme can automatically rectify the matching errors produced by one seed only. Last, the cells' lineage tracklets are associated by using the cells' spatial---temporal context to obtain long-term trajectories. Compared with the existing local graph matching method, the experimental results show that the proposed method improves the tracking accuracy rate by about 30% in the unregistered image sequences.},

abstract = {Accurate segmentation of zebrafish from bright-field microscope images is crucial to many applications in the life sciences. Early zebrafish stages are used, and in these stages the zebrafish is partially transparent. This transparency leads to edge ambiguity as is typically seen in the larval stages. Therefore, segmentation of zebrafish objects from images is a challenging task in computational bio-imaging. Popular computational methods fail to segment the relevant edges, which subsequently results in inaccurate measurements and evaluations. Here we present a hybrid method to accomplish accurate and efficient segmentation of zebrafish specimens from bright-field microscope images. We employ the mean shift algorithm to augment the colour representation in the images. This improves the discrimination of the specimen to the background and provides a segmentation candidate retaining the overall shape of the zebrafish. A distance-regularised level set function is initialised from this segmentation candidate and fed to an improved level set method, such that we can obtain another segmentation candidate which preserves the explicit contour of the object. The two candidates are fused using heuristics, and the hybrid result is refined to represent the contour of the zebrafish specimen. We have applied the proposed method on two typical datasets. From experiments, we conclude that the proposed hybrid method improves both efficiency and accuracy of the segmentation of the zebrafish specimen. The results are going to be used for high-throughput applications with zebrafish.},

In this article, twelve different widely-used morphological algorithms are evaluated followed by a random forest classifier for detecting infected erythrocytes based on their performance vis-a-vis microscopic blood smear images. Accurate detection of infected malaria erythrocytes is done using the two ranges of blood smear image datasets with varying malaria parasite density. Finally, compared to 11 morphological techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, the qualitative assessment of experimental results unveil that the Histogram method offers more meaningful and impactful findings.},

abstract = {Analyzing social streams is important for many applications, such as crisis management. However, the considerable diversity, increasing volume, and high dynamics of social streams of large events continue to be significant challenges that must be overcome to ensure effective exploration. We propose a novel framework by which to handle complex social streams on a budget PC. This framework features two components: 1) an online method to detect important time periods (i.e., subevents), and 2) a tailored GPU-assisted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method, which clusters the tweets of subevents stably and efficiently. Based on the framework, we present StreamExplorer to facilitate the visual analysis, tracking, and comparison of a social stream at three levels. At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives. Two case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of StreamExplorer.},

The surface morphology and crystalline structure of the samples were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The size of the film grain increased with the CZ parameter, and the films exhibited a zinc oxide structure with preferred (101) orientations. The Ca content and the optical bandgap increased with the CZ parameter as well. Hall measurements were carried out to determine the carrier concentration and mobility. All films showed n-type conduction, with concentrations ranging from 1.7 1016 to 8.7 1016 cm\'{y}3 for the unintentionally doped CaZnO films. The concentration showed an increasing--flat behavior, and the mobility showed flat--decreasing behavior with an increase in the CZ parameter. Different deep-level states were identified by analyzing the photoluminescence, and these states dominate the carrier concentration of the CaZnO films prepared via spray pyrolysis.},

abstract = {During avalanche breakdown, hot carriers are generated due to impact ionization. In a MOSFET, some of these hot carriers impinge on the field oxide and can be captured in the oxide. Over time, this leads to an accumulation of fixed charges at the Si/SiO$$_2$$2 interface and consequently to a degradation of device characteristics. Among those characteristics, the drift of the avalanche breakdown voltage is one of the most important aspects of device reliability. In this study, we present the first microscopic simulation of the oxide charge generation due to hot carriers and their field-driven recombination under avalanche breakdown conditions in a vertical power MOSFET. The distribution functions of electrons and holes in the device are calculated by solving their coupled Boltzmann equations. Based on the hot-carrier distribution functions, the injection rates of hot electrons and holes into the field oxide are evaluated. The resulting drift of the avalanche breakdown voltage in this simulation is in good agreement with experimental results. The underlying device internal processes are discussed, and the gained insight might help to improve the reliability of power transistors.},

The cortical bone microstructure is represented by several osteons arranged based on bone microscopy image. The accuracy of results is examined by comparing a linear elastic fracture mechanics approach with a cohesive segment approach and varying the finite element model mesh density, element type, damage evolution, and boundary conditions. Microstructural features of cortical bone are assumed to be linear elastic and isotropic. We find that the accuracy of results is influenced by the finite element model mesh density, simulation increment size, element type, and the fracture approach type. Using a relatively fine mesh or small simulation increment size gives inaccurate results compared to using an optimized mesh density and simulation increment size. Also, mechanical properties of cortical bone phases influence the crack propagation path and speed.},

abstract = {Early detection of cancer can increase patients' survivability and treatment options. Medical images such as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and microscopic images are the common method for cancer diagnosis. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been used to help physicians in cancer diagnosis so that the diagnosis accuracy can be improved. CAD can help in decreasing missed cancer lesions due to physician fatigue, reducing the burden of workload and data overloading, and decreasing variability of inter- and intra-readers of images. In this research, a framework of CAD systems for cancer diagnosis based on medical images has been proposed. The proposed work helps physicians in detection of suspicion regions using different medical images modalities and in classifying the detected suspicious regions as normal or abnormal with the highest possible accuracy. The proposed framework of CAD system consists of four stages which are: preprocessing, segmentation of regions of interest, feature extraction and selection, and finally classification. In this research, the framework has been applied on blood smear images to diagnose the cases as normal or abnormal for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cases. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been used to select the subsets of features from the features extracted from segmented cell parts which can maximize the classification performance as possible. Different classifiers which are Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Na\"{\i}ve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied. The framework has been yielding promising results which reached 96.25% accuracy, 97.3% sensitivity, and 95.35% specificity using decision tree classifier.},

abstract = {This paper describes a sliding mode observer scheme for estimation of the shear force affecting the cantilever in a Transverse Dynamic Force Microscope (TDFM). The vertically oriented cantilever is oscillated in the proximity to the specimen under investigation. The amplitude of oscillation of the cantilever tip is affected by these shear forces. They are created by the ordered‐water layer above the specimen. The oscillation amplitude is therefore a measure of distance between the tip and the surface of the specimen. Consequently, the estimation of the shear forces provides useful information about the specimen characteristics. For estimating the shear forces, an approximate finite dimensional model of the cantilever is created using the method of lines. This model is subsequently reduced in terms of its order. An unknown input sliding mode observer has been used to reconstruct the unknown shear forces using only tip position measurements and the cantilever excitation. This paper describes the development of the sliding mode scheme and presents experimental results from the TDFM set up at the Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information (NSQI) at Bristol University.},

abstract = {Limestones containing abundant disc-shaped fossil Nummulites can form significant hydrocarbon reservoirs but they have a distinctly heterogeneous distribution of pore shapes, sizes and connectivities, which make it particularly difficult to calculate petrophysical properties and consequent flow outcomes. The severity of the problem rests on the wide length-scale range from the millimetre scale of the fossil's pore space to the micron scale of rock matrix pores. This work develops a technique to incorporate multi-scale void systems into a pore network, which is used to calculate the petrophysical properties for subsequent flow simulations at different stages in the limestone's petrophysical evolution. While rock pore size, shape and connectivity can be determined, with varying levels of fidelity, using techniques such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM), this work represents a more challenging class where the rock of interest is insufficiently sampled or, as here, has been overprinted by extensive chemical diagenesis. The main challenge is integrating multi-scale void structures derived from both SEM and CT images, into a single model or a pore-scale network while still honouring the nature of the connections across these length scales. Pore network flow simulations are used to illustrate the technique but of equal importance, to demonstrate how supportable earlier-stage petrophysical property distributions can be used to assess the viability of several potential geological event sequences. The results of our flow simulations on generated models highlight the requirement for correct determination of the dominant pore scales (one plus of nm, m, mm, cm), the spatial correlation and the cross-scale connections. New methodology to model spatially-distinct, multi-scale pore systems; .Validation of the workflow to represent such multi-component pore systems in fossiliferous carbonate rocks.Demonstration using pre-existing flow simulation tools of the complex impact of fossil cementation and dissolution.},

abstract = {Statistical machine learning is widely used in image classification. However, most techniques (1) require many images to achieve high accuracy and (2) do not provide support for reasoning below the level of classification, and so are unable to support secondary reasoning, such as the existence and position of light sources and other objects outside the image. This paper describes an Inductive Logic Programming approach called Logical Vision which overcomes some of these limitations. LV uses Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) combined with low-level extraction of high-contrast points sampled from the image to learn recursive logic programs describing the image. In published work LV was demonstrated capable of high-accuracy prediction of classes such as regular polygon from small numbers of images where Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks gave near random predictions in some cases. LV has so far only been applied to noise-free, artificially generated images. This paper extends LV by (a) addressing classification noise using a new noise-telerant version of the MIL system Metagol, (b) addressing attribute noise using primitive-level statistical estimators to identify sub-objects in real images, (c) using a wider class of background models representing classical 2D shapes such as circles and ellipses, (d) providing richer learnable background knowledge in the form of a simple but generic recursive theory of light reflection. In our experiments we consider noisy images in both natural science settings and in a RoboCup competition setting. The natural science settings involve identification of the position of the light source in telescopic and microscopic images, while the RoboCup setting involves identification of the position of the ball. Our results indicate that with real images the new noise-robust version of LV using a single example (i.e. one-shot LV) converges to an accuracy at least comparable to a thirty-shot statistical machine learner on both prediction of hidden light sources in the scientific settings and in the RoboCup setting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a general background recursive theory of light can itself be invented using LV and used to identify ambiguities in the convexity/concavity of objects such as craters in the scientific setting and partial obscuration of the ball in the RoboCup setting.},

abstract = {The near-field measurement is based generally on the use of purely passive miniature sensors, dedicated to the capture of a component of the electromagnetic field. The performances of probe are characterized by two quantities: the sensitivity and spatial resolution, related to the geometry of the probe. Improve the spatial resolution of a sensor is often at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we have presented non-conventional planar microwave probe. We achieved These electrical probes, based on a combination of coplanar line and the point effect, using the clean room techniques. The motivation behind the choice of a coplanar line with a pointed end is the fact of having a quasi-TEM propagation mode in order to have the performances of the conventional coaxial probes and secondly to have a compatibility with the integrated circuits for future microwave integrated microscopy. To prevent the oxidation problem, we choose gold as the metal structure. We used an oxidized silicon substrate in order to reduce losses in the silicon. Simulations and measurements results on a micro-strip line have shown that the probe is mainly sensitive to the normal electric field. The estimated sensitivity is 30 µV/(V/m). Using this CPW probe on a precision X---Y scanning table, 2D images of micro-strip line have been successfully constructed, indicated that the ratio of the resolution to the wavelength $$R/lambda$$R/\'{y} is around $$0.66times 10^{-4}$$0.66 10-4 at 1 GHz.},

The functional properties of a NiTi component can be augmented by changing the energy source. With different actuation medium (electricity, hot water and laser), as the temperature reaches 30---80 °C, spring gets fully compressed for the first few cycles followed by loss in actuation. The actuation loss is then studied with different characterization methods such as scanning electron microscopy, thermo gravimetric analysis and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. With SEM results, it can be inferred that the energy source is not deteriorating the structure. Results observed from TGA shows high oxygen content at lower temperature limits with hot water actuation which suggest the need of conducting experiments in inert atmosphere, where as EDX throws light on chemical composition and gives the result in form of peaks.},

Application of nanostructures like diffractive X-ray lenses requires feature sizes of below 10nm to enter a new regime in high resolution X-ray microscopy.

X-ray lenses fabricated in this way are tested for their efficiency and microscopic resolution.

In this study, numerical modeling to quantitatively study the geometrical and operational parameters' effect on uniformity and pressure drop have been used. Results show that in basic A type model, inlet manifold angle and outlet manifold angle with respect to the horizontal line, have a significant effect on the distribution of flow and increasing in the angle has a negative effect on the uniformity of the flow. In trapezoidal structure, studies show that it is better for the distribution when the inlet flow is aligned with the flow direction in channels and studies on curved inlet and outlet manifolds showed that concave manifold results in better uniformity due to lesser dead volume.},

Secondly, we propose a cascade matching approach that will reduce the time for the nearest neighbour search considerably, making it almost independent on feature vector length. Moreover, several improvements are proposed that will speed up the whole matching process. These are: faster interest point detection, a regular sampling strategy and a deterministic false positive removal procedure that finds the transformation. All steps of the improved pipeline are explained and the results comparative experiments are presented.},

Experimental results indicate that the analgesic-eluting ureteral stents could liberate high strengths of analgesics in vitro and in vivo for at least 50 and 30 days, respectively.

The recent developments in the field of particle science and technology show that the shape of the particle other than size and surface chemistry are important. Most commonly, digital images captured either by microscopy or other means are analyzed by image processing methods to completely characterize the shape of the objects. Among many possible shapes, ellipse like objects are ubiquitous and encountered across several disciplines - for example - face recognition in computer vision, classification of food grains and leaves, study of particle shape effects in colloid science, etc. Detection of particle position and their orientation is therefore of great interest to quantitatively understand the phenomena under investigation. In this article we propose a major axis voted method for the detection of ellipse-like objects in 2D images which is based on the assumption that each pair of boundary pixels are on the endpoints of the minor axis of the ellipse. We show that the method thus developed is capable of detecting occluded ellipses as well as deformed ellipses.},

In recent years, Zika virus (ZIKV) caused a new pandemic due to its rapid spread and close relationship with microcephaly. As a result, ZIKV has become an obvious global health concern. Information about the fundamental viral features or the biological process of infection remains limited, despite considerable efforts. Meanwhile, the icosahedral shell structure of the mature ZIKV was recently revealed by cryo-electron microscopy. This structural information enabled us to simulate ZIKV. In this study, we analyzed the dynamic properties of ZIKV through simulation from the mechanical viewpoint. We performed normal mode analysis (NMA) for a dimeric structure of ZIKV consisting of the envelope proteins and the membrane proteins as a unit structure. By analyzing low-frequency normal modes, we captured intrinsic vibrational motions and defined basic vibrational properties of the unit structure. Moreover, we also simulated the entire shell structure of ZIKV at the reduced computational cost, similar to the case of the unit structure, by utilizing its icosahedral symmetry. From the NMA results, we can not only comprehend the putative dynamic fluctuations of ZIKV but also verify previous inference such that highly mobile glycosylation sites would play an important role in ZIKV. Consequently, this theoretical study is expected to give us an insight on the underlying biological functions and infection mechanism of ZIKV.},

This process improves the existing testing method's inefficiencies to assess the results obtained of the infected blood. Image processing algorithm was constructed to establish a standardized test procedure as a way to process the information. The algorithm is built to process the images obtained from the microscopic image of the infected blood and detect the extent of Plasmodium infection which is the cause of Malaria Disease. The images obtained from the infected red blood cells and uninfected red blood cells are processed using the image processing algorithm to distinguish the number of cells infected by malaria in the infected blood. A quantitative analysis is carried out using the results to evaluate the extent of the infection in the blood cells. To establish the relationship between the number of infected and uninfected cells, the algorithm was constructed based on color image processing through HSV color space and morphological image processing techniques. The key configuration for the proposed algorithm is the morphological image processing technique which clearly divide the red blood cells in the micrograph based on the extent of penetration of plasmodium in the blood cells using the clamp splitting method and categorize the infected blood cells.},

abstract = {Malaria parasitemia is the quantitative measurement of the parasites in the blood to grade the degree of infection. Light microscopy is the most well-known method used to examine the blood for parasitemia quantification. The visual quantification of malaria parasitemia is laborious, time-consuming and subjective. Although automating the process is a good solution, the available techniques are unable to evaluate the same cases such as anemia and hemoglobinopathies due to deviation from normal RBCs' morphology. The main aim of this research is to examine the microscopic images of stained thin blood smears using a variety of computer vision techniques, grading malaria parasitemia on independent factors (RBC's morphology). The proposed methodology is based on inductive approach, color segmentation of malaria parasites through adaptive algorithm of Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The quantification accuracy of RBCs is improved, splitting the occlusions of RBCs with distance transform and local maxima. Further, the classification of infected and non-infected RBCs has been made to properly grade parasitemia. The training and evaluation have been carried out on image dataset with respect to ground truth data, determining the degree of infection with the sensitivity of 98 % and specificity of 97 %. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme in the context of being automatic were proved experimentally, surpassing other state-of-the-art schemes. In addition, this research addressed the process with independent factors (RBCs' morphology). Eventually, this can be considered as low-cost solutions for malaria parasitemia quantification in massive examinations.},

To validate the proposed algorithm performances, a comparative study against related works using multispectral imagery is conducted including an evaluation on three different multiclass datasets of multispectral histology images: two representing images of colorectal biopsies - one dataset was acquired in the visible spectrum while the second captures near-infrared spectra. The proposed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99.6% on the different datasets. The results obtained demonstrate the advantages of infrared wavelengths to capture more efficiently the most discriminative information. The results obtained show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other similar methods.},

The influence of different substrates (glass, silicon wafers, and stainless steel) on the microstructure, morphology, and mechanical properties of nanostructured C-Ag thin films was characterized by High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and TI 950 (Hysitron) nanoindenter equipped with Berkovich indenter, respectively. The film’s hardness deposited on glass (HC-Ag/Gl = 1.8 GPa) was slightly lower than in the case of the C-Ag film deposited on a silicon substrate (HC-Ag/Si = 2.2 GPa). Also the apparent elastic modulus Eeff was lower for C-Ag/Gl sample (Eeff = 100 GPa) than for C-Ag/Si (Eeff = 170 GPa), while the values for average roughness are Ra=2.9 nm (C-Ag/Si) and Ra=10.6 (C-Ag/Gl). Using the modulus mapping mode, spontaneous and indentation-induced aggregation of the silver nanoparticles was observed for both C-Ag/Gl and C-Ag/Si samples. The nanocomposite C-Ag film exhibited not only higher hardness and effective elastic modulus, but also a higher fracture resistance toughness to the silicon substrate compared to the glass substrate.},

abstract = {Gold nanoparticle (AuNP) physicochemical characteristics, mainly size and charge, modulate their biodistribution, cytotoxicity, and immunorecognition as reported from in vitro and in vivo studies. While data from in vitro studies could be biased by several factors including activation of cells upon isolation and lack of sera proteins in the microenvironment of primary generated cell lines, in vivo studies are costly and time-consuming and require ethics consideration. In this study, we developed a simple and novel in vivo-like method to test for NP immunorecognition from freshly withdrawn human blood samples. AuNPs with a size range of 30 ± 5 nm coated with cationic poly(L-lysine) (PLL) dendrigraft and slightly negative poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were synthesized in water. PLL-capped AuNPs were further coated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to obtain nearly neutrally charged PEG-AuNPs. Physicochemical properties were determined using zeta potential measurements, UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Gel electrophoretic separation, zeta potential, and DLS were also used to characterize our NPs after human blood plasma treatment. PLL-AuNPs showed similar variation in charge and binding affinity to plasma proteins in comparison with PVA-AuNPs. However, PLL-AuNPs.protein complexes revealed a drastic change in size compared to the other tested particles. Results obtained from the neutrophil function test and pyridine formazan extraction revealed the highest activation level of neutrophils (~70%) by 50 μg/mL of PLL-AuNPs compared to a null induction by PEG- and PVA-AuNPs. This observation was further verified by flow cytometry analysis of polymorphonuclear cell size variation in the presence of coated AuNPs. Overall, our in vivo-like method, to test for NP immunorecognition, proved to be reliable and effective. Finally, our data supports the use of PEG-AuNPs as promising vehicles for drug delivery, as they exhibit minimal protein adsorption affinity and insignificant charge and size variation once introduced in whole blood.},

Various dental treatments have been developed to prevent WSLs; the prevalence and incidence of these lesions remain significantly high. Although silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have demonstrated good inhibitory effects against several microorganisms, more studies about antiadherence activity on different orthodontic appliance surfaces are necessary. To determine the inhibitory effect and antiadherence activity of AgNPs on the adhesion of S. mutans on surfaces of brackets and wires for orthodontic therapies, two sizes of AgNPs were prepared and characterized. The evaluation of S. mutans adhesion was performed with microbiological assays on surfaces of brackets and orthodontic modules in triplicate. Topographic characteristics of orthodontic brackets and wires were made by scanning electron and atomic force microscopies. All AgNP samples inhibited S. mutans adhesion; however, the smaller AgNPs had better inhibition than the larger ones. The presence of the module influenced the adhesion of S. mutans but not in the activity of AgNPs. The AgNPs used in this study showed to have good antimicrobial and antiadherence properties against S. mutans bacteria determining its high potential use for the control of WSLs in orthodontic treatments.},

The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in two application scenarios: (i) prediction of frailty in older people using multisensor recordings and (ii) breast cancer classification based on histopathology images.

The results show that the flow properties, the impact strength, the elongation at break, and the flame retardancy are improved with the proper addition of MWNT. The morphological behavior indicates the fracture surface of HIPS/MWNT is more roughness than that of HIPS. The addition of MWNT has little influence on the thermal stability of HIPS.},

A series of LDPE nanocomposites containing different amount of organomodified montmorillonite (clay) with and without compatibilizer have been prepared by means of melt compounding. Two sets of blends of LDPE with two grades of Styrene-Ethylene-Butylene-Styrene block copolymers have been prepared to form cocontinuous structure and host the nanoreinforcement. A high degree of dispersion of oriented clay was observed through X-ray diffraction, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. This was confirmed by the solid-like behavior of storage modulus in low frequencies in rheological measurement results. An alteration in the morphology of blends was witnessed upon addition of clay where the transportation phenomenon to the copolymer phase resulted in a downsizing on the domain size of the constituents of the immiscible blends. The AC breakdown strength of nanocomposites significantly increased when clay was incorporated. The partially exfoliated and intercalated clay platelets are believed to distribute the electric stress and prolong the breakdown time by creating a tortuous path for charge carriers. However, the incorporation of clay has been shown to diminish the DC breakdown strength of nanocomposites, mostly due to the thermal instability brought by clay.},

The morphology and crystallinity of ZnO-nt were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. ZnO-nt with polymeric silane (PDMS) exhibited maximum wettability as compared to nonpolymeric silane (DMDEOS).

The WCA of ZnO-nt/PDMS was higher (165°) than that of commercial ZnO/PDMS (ZnO-C/PDMS). ZnO-nt/PDMS was strongly attached to the glass substrate with good stability and adhesion. The reasons for improved hydrophobicity, adhesion, and mechanism of hierarchical microstructure formation on the glass substrate were explained in detail.

The results showed that SLA + HT could result in not only formation of microscale groove containing submicroscale and nanoscale porous structures in Ti samples but also rough and hydrophilic surface. SLA + HT treatment has the best effects on cell adhesion and spreading. Significantly increased levels of ALP activity and osteogenic genes including Alp, Ocn, Opn, Runx2, and Bsp, as well as p38 but not ERK phosphorylation, were found in the SLA + HT group.

In this study, we present results of MoS2 monolayer growth by strategically placing water droplets on the growth substrate and/or in the source prior to its loading in the growth chamber. The volume and distribution of water on the growth substrate and in the source had a direct impact on the morphology of the as-grown MoS2. Characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM), the number and size of MoS2 layers as well as its distribution on the growth substrate were found to have a strong dependence on the positioning of the water droplet. This study on MoS2 monolayer growth using water droplets as a promoter provides a simple and reproducible experimental technique enabling growth with high reliability.},

abstract = {In dynamical systems, local interactions between dynamical units generate correlations which are stored and transmitted throughout the system, generating the macroscopic behavior. However a framework to quantify exactly how these correlations are stored, transmitted, and combined at the microscopic scale is missing. Here we propose to characterize the notion of “information processing” based on all possible Shannon mutual information quantities between a future state and all possible sets of initial states. We apply it to the 256 elementary cellular automata (ECA), which are the simplest possible dynamical systems exhibiting behaviors ranging from simple to complex. Our main finding is that only a few information features are needed for full predictability of the systemic behavior and that the “information synergy” feature is always most predictive. Finally we apply the idea to foreign exchange (FX) and interest-rate swap (IRS) time-series data. We find an effective “slowing down” leading indicator in all three markets for the 2008 financial crisis when applied to the information features, as opposed to using the data itself directly. Our work suggests that the proposed characterization of the local information processing of units may be a promising direction for predicting emergent systemic behaviors.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to prepare and study the cadmium sulfide quantum dot-graphene oxide-chitosan composite thin film. This composite material was coated on top of the gold layer by a spin-coating technique as a modification of the active layer for metal ion sensing using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR). The composite material was prepared using a simple wet solution mixing method. An atomic force microscope (AFM) shows that the addition of GO increased the roughness of the composite thin film and the presence of CdS QDs cannot be observed as the size of the QDs are very small. The morphology of the nanocomposite material was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the TEM images, it is observed that the materials mixed to form a nanocomposite material. The optical properties of the thin film via UV-Vis spectroscopy shows that the absorbance peaks of the thin film can be observed around 220 nm to near 300 nm, and the band gaps are around 4.0 eV. Lastly, the prepared thin film was tested as an active layer for metal ion detection via surface plasmon resonance (SPR), where the angle shift was observed to show that the prepared thin film has high potential for Co2+ ion detection.},

abstract = {The growth through the green chemical bath of PbS doped systematically with the biomolecule L-tryptophan led to growth of hybrid, inorganic-organic, nanocrystalline thin films onto glass slides at T~80°C. The thickness was found in the range of 230–140 nm. Morphological changes were analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) spectra showed broad absorption bands located at ~3450 cm−1 attributed to stretching of the H2O molecules and two small absorption bands located at ~2285 cm−1 and ~2918 cm−1 along with a strong band at ~1385 cm−1 assigned to vibration modes corresponding to CO32− ions. In the patterns of X-ray diffraction (XRD), the cubic phase was identified in all the samples according to the angular positions 2θ~26.08°, 30.13°, 43.08°, 51.91°, 53.60°, 6251°, 68.98°, and 71.15°. Using the Scherrer formula on the XRD patterns, the grain size (GS) was determined; for the undoped sample, ~42 nm was found, whereas for the doped samples, ~42–22 nm was found. The electronic charge distribution of L-tryptophan was determined using the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) to understand the decrease on the GS associated with the interaction of π electrons from conjugated rings and amino-acid functional groups. The absorbance spectra in doped films showed excitonic peaks at ~1.8–2.1 eV associated to a higher energy of the 1Sh → 1Sh and 1Ph → 1Pe electronic transitions. Through optical absorption, a shift for the band gap energy was observed from ~1.4 eV for the undoped sample and ~2.1–2.3 eV for the doped films, respectively. Such behaviour is generally associated with the GS decrease and the effect of quantum confinement; a simple model by calculating changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) for growth of nanocrystals is presented.},

abstract = {Highly photocatalytically active anatase TiO2 were synthesized by a solvothermal method using tetrabutyl titanate (TBT), citric acid, and ethanol as row material. The morphology and photocatalytic activity of titanium oxide have changed significantly with the presence of surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), and diethanolamine (DEA). Scanning electron microscope and X-ray powder diffraction results show that the synthesized products are anatase TiO2 spherical particles with a micronanostructure. The crystal type of TiO2 has no obvious change with the addition of different surfactants, but the morphology, size, and dispersion of the TiO2 particles have changed to some extent. Among the three surfactants, CTAB is beneficial to reduce TiO2 particle size and improve TiO2 dispersion and agglomeration. DEA is favor to self-assembly the nanocrystals into spherical particles. Degradation of methyl orange photocatalyzed by TiO2 prepared with CTAB as surfactant reaches 95.4% under ultraviolet light for 100 min. After five recycles, the catalyst did not exhibit significant loss of photocatalytic activity, confirming that the photocatalyst is essentially stable. This work indicates that the surfactant-assisted solvothermal method is an effective approach to improve the structure, morphology, and photocatalytic performance of TiO2. Moreover, the surfactants with various types can interact with the precursors of TiO2 in different ways.},

Cell viability in lymphocytes treated with TiO2 NPs did not cause genotoxicity. In the histopathological findings of hepatic and renal tissue, nuclear alterations and necrosis were observed. The objective of the study was to improve the physical and biocompatibility characteristics of the NiTi arches for which the EPD is used. The technique for the deposition of TiO2 NPs was used, where this technique could be used as an economical and versatile way to perform homogeneous depositions even on surfaces with the complexity of the NiTi alloy.

Results prove that the original model suffers more serious damage than the reinforced model; in particular, longitudinal cracks appear on bottoms of two longitudinal walls in the original model, while these cracks appear later in the reinforced model; a lot of cracks appear on the door hole of the original model, and no crack appears in the reinforced model till the end of seismic waves; seismic damage of walls in the reinforced model is obviously lighter than that in the original model; dynamic responses at all observed points of the reinforced masonry are obviously less than those of the original model. Strains at all positions of the reinforced model are obviously smaller than those of the original model. From macroscopic and microscopic perspectives, the computational results prove that the reinforced proposal proposed in this paper can effectively improve the antiseismic performance of the masonry structure.},

The surface characteristics of the specimens were monitored by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), contact angle measurements (CA), and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Additionally, the activities of bone marrow cells, such as cytoskeletal, proliferative activities, mineralization, and osteogenesis-related gene expression on the substrates were investigated in detail. The characterization results demonstrated that ICA-loaded TiO2 nanotubes were successfully fabricated and the hydrophilicity of these TiO2 nanotubes was significantly higher than that of the pure Ti groups. The results also showed that ICA-loaded TiO2 nanotubes might not have enhanced effects on cell proliferation and ALP expression. However, it seemed to significantly promote differentiation of bone marrow cells, demonstrated by enhancing the formation of mineralized nodule and the upregulation of the gene expression such as OC, BSP, OPN, and COL-1. The results indicated that ICA-loaded TiO2 nanotubes can modulate bioactivity of bone marrow cells, which is promising for potential applications in the orthopedics field.},

abstract = {Lane changing is one of the most common maneuvers on motorways. Although macroscopic traffic models are well known for their suitability to describe fast moving crowded traffic, most of these models are generally developed in a one-dimensional framework; henceforth lane-changing behavior is either not explicitly modeled or is explicitly forbidden. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic model which accounts for lane-changing behavior on motorways, based on a two-dimensional extension of the Aw and Rascle [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 60 (2000), pp. 916--938] and Zhang [Transport. Res. B-Meth., 36 (2002), pp. 275--290] macroscopic model for traffic flow.  Under conditions when lane-changing maneuvers are no longer possible, the model “relaxes” to the one-dimensional Aw--Rascle--Zhang model. Following the same approach as in [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 63 (2002), pp. 259--278], we derive the two-dimensional macroscopic model through  scaling of time discretization of a microscopic follow-the-leader model with driving direction. We provide a detailed analysis of the space-time discretization of the proposed macroscopic model as well as an approximation of the solution to the associated Riemann problem. Furthermore, we illustrate some promising features of the proposed model through some numerical experiments.},

Each anodization parameter had three levels using an experimental set of L9 orthogonal arrays. Variation in the bias voltage was recorded during the AAO process, and an energy-dispersive spectrometer was used to analyze the variations in the composition of the oxidized films. Variations in surface morphology and cross-sections of the AAO were examined using a scanning electron microscope. Finally, the potentiostatic polarization method was used to judge the relative corrosion resistance of the oxidized films.

abstract = {Background and objectivesThe diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is purely dependent on counting the percentages of blasts (&gt;20%) in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. Manual microscopic examination of peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate smears is time consuming and less accurate. The first and very important step in blast recognition is the segmentation of the cells from the background for further cell feature extraction and cell classification. In this paper, we aimed to utilize computer technologies in image analysis and artificial intelligence to develop an automatic program for blast recognition and counting in the aspirate smears. MethodsWe proposed a method to analyze the aspirate smear images, which first performs segmentation of the cells by k-means cluster, then builds cell image representing model by HMRF (Hidden-Markov Random Field), estimates model parameters through probability of EM (expectation maximization), carries out convergence iteration until optimal value, and finally achieves second stage refined segmentation. Furthermore, the segmentation results are compared with several other methods using six classes of cells respectively. ResultsThe proposed method was applied to six groups of cells from 61 bone marrow aspirate images, and compared with other algorithms for its performance on the analysis of the whole images, the segmentation of nucleus, and the efficiency of calculation. It showed improved segmentation results in both the cropped images and the whole images, which provide the base for down-stream cell feature extraction and identification. ConclusionsSegmentation of the aspirate smear images using the proposed method helps the analyst in differentiating six groups of cells and in the determination of blasts counting, which will be of great significance for the diagnosis of acutemyeloidleukemia.},

abstract = {RRAM devices have been subjected to intense research efforts and are proposed for nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic applications. In this paper we describe a multiscale modeling platform connecting the microscopic properties of the resistive switching material to the electrical characteristics and operation of RRAM devices. The platform allows self-consistently modeling the charge and ion transport and the material structural modifications occurring during RRAM operations and reliability, i.e., conductive filament creation and partial disruption. It allows describing the electrical behavior (current, forming, switching, cycling, reliability tests) of RRAM devices in static and transient conditions and their dependence on external conditions (e.g., temperature). Thanks to the kinetic Monte Carlo approach, the inherent variability of physical processes is properly accounted for. Simulation results can be used both to investigate material properties (including atomic defect distributions) and to optimize stack and bias pulses for optimum device performances and reliability.},

abstract = {E.coli O157:H7 is one of the harmful foodborne pathogenic disease causing bacterium which leads many illnesses and even deaths each year. IDT or IDE (Interdigitated Electrode) based biosensors usually use electrochemical behavior through impedometric detection. In this paper we describe a novel mechanism for E.coli O157:H7 ssDNA target detection via electrical behavior through E.coli O157:H7 probe and (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) functionalized Au IDE biosensor. Tween-20 was used as blocking the nonspecific binding on non-immobilized area of the E.coli ssDNA probes. Au IDE was fabricated on the Si substrate using CMOS and conventional photolithographic process. Fabricated Au IDE was physically characterized by using high power microscope (HPM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). IDE electrode edges were characterized using 3D nano profiler. The E.coli O157:H7 ssDNA probes were used as the receptor to capture the specific target ssDNA and Au IDE was used as the transducer. I-V characteristics were performed for each functionalization step as bare Au IDE, silanization and immobilization. Well functionalized biosensor was hybridized with complementary, non-complementary and single base mismatch ssDNA to confirm the specificity. Sensitivity measurements were done using different concentrations of complementary ssDNA targets from 1fM to 10 µM. The sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) of the biosensor are 14.3 mAM\'{z}1 and 0.8 fM respectively. It was confirmed that Au IDE biosensor shown here is capable to detect specific and low concentrated E.coli O157:H7 ssDNA targets successfully.},

abstract = {The paper, we present a novel algorithm to split overlapped nuclei in histopathological tissue images.The proposed algorithm draws circles on overlapped nuclei for splitting.The pixels in the circle that contains maximum number of intersected pixels in both the circle and the overlapped nuclei labeled as a nucleus.Experimental results and the evaluation demonstrated that the nuclei in an image containing overlapping can be segmented with accuracy of 84% by applying the proposed splitting algorithm. Background and objectiveNuclei segmentation is a common process for quantitative analysis of histopathological images. However, this process generally results in overlapping of nuclei due to the nature of images, the sample preparation and staining, and image acquisition processes as well as insufficiency of 2D histopathological images to represent 3D characteristics of tissues. We present a novel algorithm to split overlapped nuclei. MethodsThe histopathological images are initially segmented by K-Means segmentation algorithm. Then, nuclei cluster are converted to binary image. The overlapping is detected by applying threshold area value to nuclei in the binary image. The splitting algorithm is applied to the overlapped nuclei. In first stage of splitting, circles are drawn on overlapped nuclei. The radius of the circles is calculated by using circle area formula, and each pixel's coordinates of overlapped nuclei are selected as center coordinates for each circle. The pixels in the circle that contains maximum number of intersected pixels in both the circle and the overlapped nuclei are removed from the overlapped nuclei, and the filled circle labeled as a nucleus. ResultsThe algorithm has been tested on histopathological images of healthy and damaged kidney tissues and compared with the results provided by an expert and three related studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed splitting algorithm can segment the overlapping nuclei with accuracy of 84%. ConclusionsThe study presents a novel algorithm splitting the overlapped nuclei in histopathological images and provides more accurate cell counting in histopathological analysis. Furthermore, the proposed splitting algorithm has the potential to be used in different fields to split any overlapped circular patterns.},

abstract = {The morphological changes induced by engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in cellular samples are a key clue to evaluate the impact of these materials on human health. The investigation of the complexity of the interaction among nanoparticles and cellular molecules requires cutting-edge instrumentation and dedicated procedures. To this regard, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a leading imaging technique that has the peculiarities of high resolution and direct relationship with 3D cellular morphology. Expert human operators, however, are still required to manage most of the AFM-based analysis, thus introducing subjective bias and allowing a limited number of trials. The modality of interaction and the resulting topographic differences are often not a priori known. Also, the presence of artefacts in AFM images may affect the derived conclusions. In this work, we propose a robust and flexible strategy to analyse AFM topography images with single click-select actions by the human operator. The proposed system allows for not only morphological studies and quantification of the changes occurring in cellular samples in the presence of nanomaterials, but also for the investigation of diversified experiments in more flexible application domains. As a proof of concepts, samples of human EA. hy926 endothelial cells exposed to carbon nanotubes are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The system is also tested against various AFM-artefact and noise scenarios and the robustness of its discrimination capability is verified.},

abstract = {Computing the macroscopic material response of a continuum body commonly involves the formulation of a phenomenological constitutive model. However, the response is mainly influenced by the heterogeneous microstructure. Computational homogenisation can be used to determine the constitutive behaviour on the macro-scale by solving a boundary value problem at the micro-scale for every so-called macroscopic material point within a nested solution scheme. Hence, this procedure requires the repeated solution of similar microscopic boundary value problems. To reduce the computational cost, model order reduction techniques can be applied. An important aspect thereby is the robustness of the obtained reduced model. Within this study reduced-order modelling (ROM) for the geometrically nonlinear case using hyperelastic materials is applied for the boundary value problem on the micro-scale. This involves the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the primary unknown and hyper-reduction methods for the arising nonlinearity. Therein three methods for hyper-reduction, differing in how the nonlinearity is approximated and the subsequent projection, are compared in terms of accuracy and robustness. Introducing interpolation or Gappy-POD based approximations may not preserve the symmetry of the system tangent, rendering the widely used Galerkin projection sub-optimal. Hence, a different projection related to a Gauss-Newton scheme (Gauss-Newton with Approximated Tensors- GNAT) is favoured to obtain an optimal projection and a robust reduced model.},

The technique predicts the variation of the process results when the macroscopic parameters related to equipment settings (e.g., power, potential, and injected gas composition) are modified. A comparison between the microscopic analysis of real structures and the etched profiles predicted by the feature scale simulations validates the coupled numerical approach.},

abstract = {This present work reports on the study of controllable aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) patterning by chemical etching for MEMS application. The AZO thin film was prepared by RF magnetron sputtering as it is capable of producing uniform thin film at high deposition rates. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization were done to characterize AZO thin film. The sputtered AZO thin film shows c-axis (002) orientation, low surface roughness and high crystalline quality. To pattern AZO thin film for MEMS application, wet etching was chosen due to its ease of processing with few controlling parameters. Four etching solutions were used namely: 10 % Nitric acid, 10 % Phosphoric acid, 10 % Acetic acid and Molybdenum etch solutions. For the first time, chemical etching using Molybdenum etch that consist of a mixture of CH3COOH, HNO3 and H3PO4 was characterized and reported. The effect of these acidic solutions on the undercut etching, vertical and lateral etch rate were studied. The etched AZO were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and stylus profilometer. The investigations showed that the Molybdenum etch has the lowest undercut etching of 7.11 µm, and is highly effective in terms of lateral and vertical etching with an etch ratio of 1.30. Successful fine patterning of AZO thin films was demonstrated at device level on a surface acoustic wave resonator fabricated in 0.35 μm CMOS technology. The AZO thin film acts as the piezoelectric thin film for acoustic wave generation. Patterning of the AZO thin film is necessary for access to measurement probe pads. The working acoustic resonator showed resonance peak at 1.044 GHz at 45.28 dB insertion loss indicating that the proposed Molybdenum etch method does not adversely affect the device's operating characteristics.},

abstract = {This paper presents a gradient based concurrent multi-scale design optimization method for composite frames considering specific manufacturing constraints raised from the aerospace industrial requirements. Geometrical parameters of the frame components at the macro-structural scale and the discrete fiber winding angles at the micro-material scale are introduced as the independent design variables at the two geometrical scales. The DMO (Discrete Material Optimization) approach is utilized to couple the two geometrical scales and realize the simultaneous optimization of macroscopic topology and microscopic material selection. Six kinds of manufacturing constraints are explicitly included in the optimization model as series of linear inequalities or equalities. The capabilities of the proposed optimization model are demonstrated with the example of compliance minimization, subject to constraint on the composite volume. The linear constraints and optimization problems are solved by Sequential Linear Programming (SLP) optimization algorithm with move limit strategy. Numerical results show the potential of weight saving and structural robustness design with the proposed concurrent optimization model. The multi-scale optimization model, considering specific manufacturing constraints, provides new choices for the design of the composite frame structure in aerospace and other industries.},

abstract = {Calibration of microscopic traffic simulation models for single-lane roundabouts.Use of a meta-analytical estimation of critical and follow up headways.Use of a genetic algorithm-based procedure.Calculation of passenger car equivalents for single-lane roundabouts. Passenger car equivalents for heavy vehicles are required to carry out capacity calculations and perform operational analysis of any road entity (roadway segments or intersections). At single-lane roundabouts, the constraints to the vehicular trajectories imposed by the curvilinear geometric design and the driver's gap acceptance behaviour are expected to produce an impact of the heavy vehicles on the quality of traffic flow different from that produced on freeways and two-lane highways or other at-grade intersections. This is also because entering flow is opposed by the circulating flow which has priority and travels in an anticlockwise direction on a single-lane path around the central island.This paper addresses the question of how to estimate the passenger car equivalents for heavy vehicles on single-lane roundabouts. First, a comparison was performed between the empirical capacity functions based on a meta-analytic estimation of the critical and the follow up headways and the simulation outputs manually obtained for a single-lane roundabout built in Aimsun microscopic simulator. A genetic algorithm-based calibration procedure, therefore, was used to reach a better convergence between the simulation outputs and the empirical capacities. Based on the calibrated model, the passenger car equivalents were determined by comparing the capacity functions built for a fleet of passenger cars with the capacity functions calculated for different percentages of heavy vehicles. Differently from HCM 2010 which assumes a heavy vehicle to be equivalent to two passenger cars and sets as 2.0 the passenger car equivalents for heavy vehicles for roundabouts, a higher PCE effect would be expected on the quality of traffic conditions when the traffic stream contains a high number of heavy vehicles; this effect should be accounted for when calculating capacity and level-of-services.},

abstract = {This paper studies the authentication problem of specific pieces of paper using mobile imaging devices. Prior work showing high matching accuracy has used the normal vector field, which serves as a unique, microscopic, physically unclonable feature of paper surfaces, estimated by consumer grade scanners. Industrial cameras were also used to capture the appearance of the surface rendered after the normal vector field based on the laws of optics under a semi-controlled lighting condition. In comparison, past explorations based on mobile cameras were very limited and have not had substantial success in obtaining consistent appearance images due to the uncontrolled nature of the ambient light. We show in this paper that images captured by mobile cameras can be used for authentication when the camera flashlight is exploited for creating a semi-controlled lighting condition. We have proposed new algorithms to demonstrate that the normal vector field of paper surface can be estimated by using multiple camera-captured images of different viewpoints. Perturbation analysis shows that the proposed method is robust to inaccurate estimates of camera locations, and a matching accuracy of  $10^{-textrm {4}}$  in equal error rate can be achieved using 6 to 8 images under a lab-controlled ambient light environment. Our findings can relax the restricted imaging setups and enable paper authentication under a more casual, ubiquitous setting with a mobile imaging device, which may facilitate duplicate detection of paper documents and counterfeit mitigation of merchandise packaging.},

A simple and accurate scheme for modeling microstructures is proposed with the help of element trimming combined with signed distance function based boundary smoothing. To accommodate randomly distributed fibers in unidirectional composites, digital image processing is used. The interfaces of multi-materials are identified by introducing a signed distance function, and then, square background elements crossing the interfaces are simply trimmed and divided to represent a single material behavior by a single element. After element trimming, the elements that are polygon-shaped in the two-dimensional domain are split into conventional three-node triangle elements (six-node prism elements in the three-dimensional domain) available in many commercial software packages. The present modeling scheme was verified through benchmark examples in terms of the accuracy and efficiency and then applied to the modeling of unidirectional composites based on real microscopic images to evaluate the equivalent elastic properties.},

abstract = {In-situ atomic layer deposition (ALD) Y2O3/Al2O3 in bi-layered and sub-nano-laminated structures were stacked on pristine GaAs(001) substrates for fabricating metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors. The bi-layered Y2O3/Al2O3 showed an enhanced effective dielectric constant from 11.1 to 15.6 in capacitance-voltage characteristics with post deposition annealing to 900C. No new oxide phase formed as carefully examined using synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction and cross-sectional high-resolution scanning tunneling electron microscopy. We designed and grew sub-nano-laminated Y2O3/Al2O3 multi-layers to simulate the mixing of gate oxides, and observed an enhanced dielectric constant of 14.8 for the as-deposited sample. Both high-temperature mixed and sub-nano-laminated ALD Y2O3/Al2O3 exhibit high dielectric constant, low leakage current ~108A/cm2 and low interfacial trap density with GaAs(001), promising for high applications in future GaAs metal-oxide-semiconductor devices.

abstract = {Pervasiveness of ubiquitous computing advances the manufacturing scheme into a ubiquitous manufacturing era which poses significant challenges on sensing technology and system reliability. To improve manufacturing system reliability, this paper presents a new virtual tool wear sensing technique based on multisensory data fusion and artificial intelligence model for tool condition monitoring. It infers the difficult-to-measure tool wear parameters (e.g. tool wear width) by fusing in-process multisensory data (e.g. force, vibration, etc.) with dimension reduction technique and support vector regression model. Different state-of-the-art dimension reduction techniques including kernel principal component analysis, locally linear embedding, isometric feature mapping, and minimum redundancy maximum relevant method have been investigated for feature fusion in a virtual sensing model, and the kernel principal component analysis performs best in terms of sensing accuracy. The effectiveness of the developed virtual tool wear sensing technique is experimentally validated in a set of machining tool run-to-failure tests on a computer numerical control milling machine. The results show that the estimated tool wear width through virtual sensing is comparable to that measured offline by a microscope instrument in terms of accuracy, moreover, in a more cost-effective manner. A multi-sensory fusion based virtual tool wear sensing model is developed.KPCA performs best among the dimension reduction techniques investigated.The virtual tool wear sensing model is validated using a machining tool life test.The performance of the model is comparable to the costly offline instrumentation.},

abstract = {Classification of sandstone microscopic images is an essential task in geology, and the classical method is either subjective or time-consuming. Computer aided automatic classification has been proved useful, but it seldom considers the situation where sandstone images are collected from separated regions. In this paper, we provide a method called Festra, which uses transfer learning to handle the problem of interregional sandstone microscopic image classification. The method contains two parts: one is feature selection, which aims to screen out features having great difference between the regions, the other is instance transfer using an enhanced TrAdaBoost, whose object is to mitigate the difference among thin section images collected from the regions. Experiments are conducted based on the sandstone images taken from four regions in Tibet to study the performance of Festra. The experimental results have proved both effectiveness and validity of Festra, which provides competitive prediction performance on all the four regions, with few target instances labeled suitable for the field use. HighlightsThe interregional sandstone microscopic image classification problem is formally defined.A transfer learning method called Festra is proposed for the problem.The method combines the feature selection and Enhanced TrAdaBoost.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analytic approach that can be used to study opinion dynamics in multi-agent systems. The results of such an analytic approach can be used as a descriptive tool capable of predicting the long-term properties of a multi-agent system, and they can also be considered a prescriptive tool that supports the design of multi-agent systems with desired asymptotic characteristics. The agents that form the multi-agent system are divided into disjoint classes characterized by different values of fixed parameters to account for the specific behaviors of single agents. Each class is characterized by the number of agents in it, by the initial distribution of the opinion, and by the characteristic propensity of single agents to change their respective opinions when interacting with other agents. The proposed approach is based on the possibility of interpreting the dynamics of the opinion in terms of the kinetic theory of gas mixtures, which allows expressing the dynamics of the average opinion of each class in terms of a suitable differential problem that can be used to derive interesting asymptotic properties. Analytic solutions of the obtained differential problem are derived and it is shown that, under suitable hypotheses, the average opinions of all classes of agents converge to the same value. The results presented in this paper differ from those commonly derived in standard kinetic theory of gas mixtures because the microscopic equations which describe the effects of interactions among agents are explicitly meant to model opinion dynamics, and they are different from those normally used to describe collisions among molecules in a gas. All presented analytic results are confirmed by simulations presented at the end of the paper.},

Therefore, in this research work the influence of counter anions on the morphology of copper oxide (CuO) nanostructures is presented using copper chloride and copper acetate salts. A significant role of counter anions on the morphology of CuO nanostructures is observed. The hydrothermal method is used to carry out the synthesis of CuO nanomaterial. The prepared CuO nanostructures are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The prepared CuO nanomaterial exhibits porous nature with thin nanowires and sponge like morphologies. The dopamine sensing application was carried for exploring the electrocatalytic properties of CuO nanostructures. The presented dopamine biosensor exhibited wide linear range for detection of dopamine from 5 to 40 µM with sensitivity of 12.8 µA mM\'{z}1 cm\'{z}2. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were estimated in order 0.11 and 0.38 µM respectively. The developed dopamine biosensor is highly sensitive, selective, stable and reproducible. The common interfering species such as glucose, ascorbic acid and uric acid showed negligible change in the current when same concentration of dopamine and these interfering species was used.

abstract = {This paper describes a modified dry peel-off process for the fabrication of gold micro heaters embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the characterization of the micro heaters, and the comparison of the measured results with simulated data. The modified dry peel-off process utilizes the difference in molecular adhesion between gold, amine (NH2), and thiol (SH). Three kinds of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were implemented in the process for controlling the adhesion between gold electrodes and crystalline silicon as well as between gold electrodes and PDMS. In this work, especially, the different affinities of 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES) and 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) to gold were exploited for the reliable transfer of three different shapes of gold micro heaters to new substrates. Octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) reduced the surface energy of silicon and enabled PDMS to easily detach from the silicon. Finally, a simple straight micro heater was characterized by using an infrared (IR) thermal microscopy, and its resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) were estimated to be 48nm and 0.0029K1, respectively, from a temperature-resistance plot. Display Omitted Gold micro heaters were transferred on PDMS substrate through different affinities of thiol (-SH) and amine (-NH2) groups.The resistivity of the gold micro heater was 48nm, and the temperature coefficient of resistance was 0.0029K1.The micro heater was stably heated up during 10cycles in the repeatability test.},

Modification of the leading edge can be caused by the accumulation of debris, insect impacts, microscopic ice crystal formation, damage, or structural fatigue, resulting in premature transition and an increase in drag. A dielectric barrier discharge DBD plasma actuator, located downstream of the excrescence, was employed to delay transition, mitigate the effects of turbulence, decrease drag, and increase energy efficiency. Solutions were obtained for several Mach numbers, up to the transonic range. The effect of compressibility on transitional behaviour was explored, and the effectiveness of plasma-based control to delay transition with increasing Mach number was determined.},

abstract = {Methodology for collagen proportional area extraction from liver biopsy images.Fully automated, machine-learning based image analysis.Robust methodology, without any threshold-based decisions.Processing low resolutions images without sophisticated equipment.Low processing time. Background and objectiveCollagen proportional area (CPA) extraction in liver biopsy images provides the degree of fibrosis expansion in liver tissue, which is the most characteristic histological alteration in hepatitis C virus (HCV). Assessment of the fibrotic tissue is currently based on semiquantitative staging scores such as Ishak and Metavir. Since its introduction as a fibrotic tissue assessment technique, CPA calculation based on image analysis techniques has proven to be more accurate than semiquantitative scores. However, CPA has yet to reach everyday clinical practice, since the lack of standardized and robust methods for computerized image analysis for CPA assessment have proven to be a major limitation. MethodsThe current work introduces a three-stage fully automated methodology for CPA extraction based on machine learning techniques. Specifically, clustering algorithms have been employed for background-tissue separation, as well as for fibrosis detection in liver tissue regions, in the first and the third stage of the methodology, respectively. Due to the existence of several types of tissue regions in the image (such as blood clots, muscle tissue, structural collagen, etc.), classification algorithms have been employed to identify liver tissue regions and exclude all other non-liver tissue regions from CPA computation. ResultsFor the evaluation of the methodology, 79 liver biopsy images have been employed, obtaining 1.31% mean absolute CPA error, with 0.923 concordance correlation coefficient. ConclusionsThe proposed methodology is designed to (i) avoid manual threshold-based and region selection processes, widely used in similar approaches presented in the literature, and (ii) minimize CPA calculation time.},

abstract = {It becomes very critical for yield enhancement to accomplish defect free global planarization during barrier CMP. Conventional commercial barrier chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) slurries usually contain benzotriazole (BTA) and oxidizer (most frequently H2O2) which could cause organic defects and oxide particles on the copper surface for post-CMP cleaning. In this paper, we present a kind of weakly alkaline barrier slurry with lower defect occurrence than conventional ones, and a key feature of the slurry is facilitating post-CMP cleaning. The experimental results obtained from the defect map show it is hard for a simple cleaning solution containing nothing but deionized water and surfactants to completely remove oxide particles and the organic residue on the wafer surface polished with the commercial barrier slurry. On the contrary, the defect map of the wafer polished with the weakly alkaline barrier slurry indicates that there is no surface contamination after cleaning with this simple cleaning solution, but there are still many defects. AFM (atomic force microscopy) graphs demonstrate these defects are scratches, and the tool views them as defects. The polishing results indicate that the root causes for scratches are the large particles exceeding 0.5m size in the slurry, and micro-scratches are remarkably reduced after installation of a 0.2m size filter without affecting the CMP performance, including dishing, resistance, capacitance and leakage current. Compared with the conventional commercial barrier CMP slurry, the alkaline barrier slurry can also control copper line corrosion due to galvanic reaction. Display Omitted The weakly alkaline barrier slurry has lower defect occurrence than conventional ones.This novel barrier slurry can get a clean surface witn a simple cleaning solution.It is an effective way for reducing the micro-scratches to filter out large particles exceeding 0.5m size in the slurryThe alkaline barrier slurry can also control copper line corrosion due to galvanic reaction},

The results obtained by the Monte Carlo method are also compared with the asymptotic solution derived from the kinetic chemotaxis equation in the continuum limit, where the Knudsen number, which is defined by the ratio of the mean free path of bacterium to the characteristic length of the system, vanishes.

Utilizing the different flow rate as a basic background, the characteristics of laminar flow that has three parallel flows within a microfluidic chip. In the main channel, only motile sperm can break through boundary layer from its original laminar flow, because motile sperm has a property of swim freely. Therefore, this mechanism can separate motile sperm from no motile sperm and other particles. Motile sperm from the upper and lower inlets in our device can break through the stream boundary to the collection reservoir. Through microscopic observation, fluorescent images of sperm with varied motility indicated that the laminar streams are similar to results from CFDRC simulation. To confirm the real sorting situation, we identified and quantified the proportions of living and dead sperm after sorting through flow cytometric analysis. We compared the reservoir sorting area and waste area to realize that efficiency is improved. The advantages of our device are including stable field, sample double processing and main channel designed gradually wider which is beneficial with increase sorting possibility.

In this study, the behavior of Cu contamination on a &lt;3-µm-thick DRAM wafer was investigated. The wafer was thinned down by coarse (#320 grit size) grinding and fine (#2000 grit size) grinding. This thinning condition had 200-nm-thick ground damage remaining for the gettering effect. The DRAM wafer was intentionally contaminated with Cu on the damaged layer, and 250°C-60min of heating was carried out during adhesive bonding and de-bonding. Degradation in the device characteristics was found. However, the analytical results indicated that the Cu did not diffuse into the thin Si. Thus, a Cu contaminated blanket wafers having a damaged layer were prepared and annealed until 1000°C-30min. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and positron annihilation spectroscopy were evaluated. The Cu was trapped in the vacancy-type defects of the 200nm damaged layer until a 700°C anneal. After an 800°C anneal, the Cu was eliminated on the damaged surface because of the Si recrystallization. The gettering ability of the damaged layer is suitable for 3D multi-level stacking regarding thermal stability. The behavior of Cu contamination on the ground damaged surface was investigated.Cu precipitates stayed at the interface between the adhesive and thin Si without diffusion into the Si.Cu was trapped in the damaged layer even after 700°C annealing because of Cu complexes with the vacancy-type defects.The gettering ability of the ground damaged layer is suitable for 3D multi-level stacking regarding thermal stability.

abstract = {We carry out a comparative performance study of multi-core CPUs, GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi Many Integrated Core MIC with a microscopy image analysis application. We experimentally evaluate the performance of computing devices on core operations of the application. We correlate the observed performance with the characteristics of computing devices and data access patterns, computation complexities, and parallelization forms of the operations. The results show a significant variability in the performance of operations with respect to the device used. The performances of operations with regular data access are comparable or sometimes better on a MIC than that on a GPU. GPUs are more efficient than MICs for operations that access data irregularly, because of the lower bandwidth of the MIC for random data accesses. We propose new performance-aware scheduling strategies that consider variabilities in operation speedups. Our scheduling strategies significantly improve application performance compared with classic strategies in hybrid configurations.},

abstract = {Efforts to address operational issues in transportation have been the focus of many research efforts. A number of these efforts were geared toward developing microscopic traffic simulation models to accurately represent the complex and dynamic operation of a transportation network. One of the challenges with such models is that they do not always adequately reflect field conditions-particularly when representing traffic operations across different time periods. This paper presents a robust calibration procedure that aims to increase the accuracy of calibrated microscopic traffic simulation models. This procedure is based on a Monte Carlo approach to generate candidate parameter sets, which are aimed to produce calibrated simulation models. Model runs of these parameter sets are evaluated against robust calibration criteria, including startup and saturation flow characteristics and travel time distributions. The parameter sets that satisfy these criteria are considered as adequately calibrated to accurately reflect field performance measures. In applying this procedure, the results suggest that this approach offers a robust and effective method of calibrating simulation models where disaggregate-level vehicle data are available-which is becoming more prevalent with further advancements in mobile sensor and connected vehicle technologies.},

All the samples synthesized by this method exhibited single-phase wurtzite structure with good crystallization as demonstrated by XRD studies, which indicated that all Cr ions successfully substituted for the lattice site of Zn2+ and generated single-phase Zn1-xCrxS. DRS revealed the band gap of doped Zn1-xCrxS underwent blue shift compared to that of the bulk ZnS. PL spectra showed obvious ultraviolet emission peak at 375 nm and two blue emissions appear about 500 and 580 nm. The blue emissions intensity of doped samples improved with the increase of Cr concentration, comparing to pure ZnS. Magnetic measurements indicated that the undoped and doped ZnS nanorods exhibited well-defined ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature. The saturation magnetization weakened significantly with increasing Cr concentration comparing to pure ZnS and reached minimum for 3% Cr.},

A microfine cement is used in conjunction with an untraditional dispersion method to encourage and stabilize the dispersion of CNFs in concentrations up to 5% by mass of cement. A computational simulation was utilized to examine an effect called geometric clustering on the dispersion of CNFs among Type I/II and microfine cement grains. The geometric clustering simulation revealed a higher achievable dispersion for microfine cement than for Type I/II cement. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to quantify the dispersion of CNFs among Type I/II and microfine cement grains. SEM image analysis indicated excessive CNF clumping among Type I/II cement grains, while the dispersion of hybrid microfine cement mortar continued to improve as the concentration of CNFs increased up to 5% by mass of cement. Mortar cube elastic stiffness and mortar prism flexure tests revealed that high concentrations of CNFs had detrimental effects in hybrid Type I/II cement mortar, whereas similar concentrations of CNFs had negligible or beneficial effects in hybrid microfine cement mortar.},

The morphology of platelets in PRP prepared from the blood incubated with AuNPs was characterized by scanning transmission electron microscopy, whereas the concentrations of growth factors and cytokines were evaluated by ELISA assays. The most promising results were obtained with equine platelets incubated with 5% AuNPs stabilized by PEI, which lead to secretion of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) and simultaneously cause decrease in concentration of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1\'{z}). The qRT-PCR confirmed ELISA test results. The incubation with 5% AuNPs stabilized by PEI leads to upregulation of BMP-2 and VEGF transcripts of mRNA level and to downregulating expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6).

The research described in this paper analyzed the responses of HSF (human skin fibroblast) cells exposed to IBC electrical signals. A galvanic coupling IBC signal transmitting system was designed to expose the experimental samples with different amplitudes (from 0 V to 6 V or 0 mA to 4 mA), different frequencies (from 10 kHz to 1 MHz), and different duration times (12 h and 24 h). The control groups were unexcited. Cell morphology and activity were evaluated with inverted microscope and MTT assays. The cell survival rates of all the experiment groups were in the range of 90% to 110%. Then, the data was analyzed by t-tests to assess whether there were statistically significant differences. The results showed that p values were greater than 0.05, so there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that the IBC signals do not have a significant effect on HSF cells.},

The aim of this work was to homogeneously disperse graphene oxide (GO) sheets into Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) and investigate the characteristics of GO/NBR nanocomposite without vulcanization. A suitable solvent was found to dissolve dry NBR while GO was exfoliated completely in an aqueous base solution using sonication. GO was dispersed into NBR at different loadings by solution mixing to produce unvulcanized GO/NBR nanocomposites. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the samples. Furthermore, mechanical and electrical properties of unvulcanized GO/NBR nanocomposites were carried out to determine the influence of GO on the NBR properties. The results showed that the modulus of GO/NBR nanocomposite at 1 wt% of GO was enhanced by about 238% compared with unfilled NBR. These results provide insight into the properties of unvulcanized GO/NBR nanocomposite for application as coatings or adhesives.},

A maximum processing temperature for this memory device is 300°C, making it ideal for Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) processing. Although some variations in the forming, set, and reset voltages (VFORM, VSET, and VRESET) are obtained for many of the measured MIM devices (mainly due to roughness variations of the MIM interfaces as observed after atomic-force microscopy analysis), the memristor effect has been obtained after cyclic I-V measurements. These resistive transitions in the metal oxide occur for both bipolar and unipolar conditions, while the IOFF/ION ratio is around 4–6 orders of magnitude and is formed at gate voltages of Vg&lt;4 V. In unipolar mode, a gradual reduction in VSET is observed and is related to combined (a) incomplete dissolution of conductive filaments (made of oxygen vacancies and metal ions) which leaves some residuals and (b) thickening of chemically reduced Al2O3 during localized Joule heating. This is important because, by analyzing the macroscopic resistive switching behavior of this MIM structure, we could indirectly relate it to microscopic and/or nanoscopic phenomena responsible for the physical mechanism upon which most of these devices operate.},

Nanotechnology-based medical applications are developing rapidly, especially in anticancer research, as nanomaterials can be retained in the cell after their entry across the cell membrane, making them potential candidates for application in the diagnosis and treatment of tumours. Here, we prepared silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silver/cetuximab (Ag/C225) particles of approximately 20 nm and investigated their inhibitory effect on proliferation of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE and laryngeal carcinoma cell line HEp-2. The MTT assay was used to determine their half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Electron microscopy revealed no obvious morphological differences between the prepared AgNPs and Ag/C225. Treatment of both cell lines with AgNPs and Ag/C225 increased the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 stage and decreased the proportion of cells in the S stage. AgNP and Ag/C225 treatments increased the expression of apoptotic proteins Bax and P21 and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 in CNE cells, compared to control cells. Ag/C225 is internalised by CNE cells, and it enhances X-irradiation-induced cytotoxicity. These results help increase the understanding of the anticancer effect of AgNPs and Ag/C225 and explore their application as radiosensitisers.},

Famotidine loaded nanoformulation (FFSe-4) showed particle size 111.9±1.3 nm, polydispersity index 0.464±0.03, zeta potential −33.46±2 mV, entrapment efficiency 84±2.7%, and drug loading capacity 2.709±0.13%.

Differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffractometry confirmed the change in crystalline nature. Prepared nanoformulation was more stable at refrigerated temperature. In vitro study showed that drug release time is proportional to drug pay load and followed zero order kinetics. Release exponent (n&gt;0.5) confirmed non-Fickian-diffusion mechanism for drug release. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed 2.06-fold increase in oral bioavailability of famotidine dispersed in solid lipid nanoparticles compared to commercial product.

At 0.25% CNTs, the results showed that those CNTs of shorter lengths attained higher strengths than those of longer ones. SEM images showed better dispersion properties at lower CNTs’ contents regardless of their geometry. The analysis also indicated that short CNTs of 0.5–2 μm length have better dispersion properties compared to long ones of 10–30 μm length. The RSM model confirmed this finding.

abstract = {Microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition (MW-CBD) was used to deposit zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO-NRs) films by using different microwave irradiation time. The films exhibit a good crystallinity having a hexagonal wurtzite phase formation. Although the dominant preferred orientation was not observed for the ZnO-5 and ZnO-10, ZnO-8 showed (002) preferred orientation. The emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) showed almost randomly oriented hexagonal nanorods on the surface. A slight decrease in the length of the observed hexagonal nanorods due to the increase in the irradiation time was observed, changing from 550 nm to 300 nm. The p-Si/n-ZnO-NRs heterojunction photodiodes were fabricated. The current-voltage characteristics of these photodiodes were investigated under dark and different illumination intensity. An increase in the reverse current with increasing illumination intensity confirmed that the fabricated photodiodes exhibited a photoconducting behavior. In addition, the barrier height and series resistance values of the photodiodes were determined from capacitance-voltage measurements.},

As a result, the iron content of the CNF/γ-Fe2O3 was increased by more than twice from about 40% to about 87% mass percent, compared to the pristine CNF and oxidized CNF specimens, as proved by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence. Scanning electron microscopy images exhibited “cumulus” on the CNF/γ-Fe2O3 specimen surface, which showed the highest iron mass percentage, proved by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy images confirmed attachment of γ-Fe2O3 cumulus to the inner and outer surfaces of the CNF walls after synthesis. The characteristic peaks of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 appeared in the XPS spectra obtained on CNF/γ-Fe2O3. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated formation of γ-Fe2O3 during the synthesis process. The Raman spectrum of the CNF/γ-Fe2O3 sample displays peaks with positions close to characteristic peaks of highly crystalline and monodisperse maghemite nanocrystallites. The synthesis of CNF/γ-Fe2O3 leads to an increase in the hydrophilicity of CNF and magnetic properties at room temperature.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the osteoblast behavior on a 3D textile of PGA (polyglycolic acid) fibers functionalized with the RGD (R: arginine; G: glycine; D: aspartic acid) peptide. The cell morphology, proliferation, and calcium phosphate deposition ability were evaluated on textiles at different time intervals under a confocal laser scanning microscope. The osteoblast viability ranged from 92% to 98%, and cell proliferation was higher in PGA-RGD than control PGA (uncoated). In addition, the osteoblast calcium phosphate deposition was significantly greater on PGA-RGD in osteogenic inductor medium (OIM) in contrast to controls without inducing factors. The PGA-RGD fibers supported proliferation and viability of osteoblast and stimulated bone osteogenesis and mineralization. These results support the adoption of this 3D polymeric textile as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering.},

A robust statistical technique, Taguchi’s method, was used to reduce the experiments number. The variables studied were precursor, solvent and precipitating agent type, Zn molar concentration, percentage of saturation, speed and time of agitation, and temperature of synthesis. In order to optimize the particle size, an experimental design of 18 trials was proposed, according to L18 Taguchi array. Structural and morphological properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques (SEM and TEM). The estimated crystallite size in synthesized samples ranged from 32 to 57 nm. The morphologies obtained presented several forms, such as spheres, wires, flowers, bars, and tetrahedrons, with a particle size variation of 35 to 165 nm. In this work it is shown that using a statistical experimental design leads us to a fast and reliable optimization of the synthesis parameters for obtaining small size ZnO nanoparticles, thus optimizing time and human and materials resources.},

Hereafter, SDS and BCP modified HNTs will be indicated as SDS-m-HNT and BCP-m-HNT.

All nanocomposites depicted improved thermal degradation compared to the neat PS as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the good dispersion state of HNTs and the importance of modification by SDS and BCP. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies showed the characteristic interlayer spacing between the two silicate layers of pristine and modified HNTs. The PS/HNT nanocomposite films exhibited excellent ultraviolent-visible (UV-vis) absorbance properties and their potential application as UV-filters could be envisaged.},

Experiments were performed to determine the altered heating characteristics of the CNT cement mortars. The parameters of the experiment were CNT type, CNT content, curing age, and applied voltage. The results for the different CNT cement mortars indicate that mixing SWCNTs with water to produce CNT cement mortars was more effective for modifying the heating characteristics compared to mixing MWCNTs with water.

Photocatalytic activity of all thin films was evaluated by measuring decomposition rate of methylene blue solution under visible light irradiation. The results indicate that ultrathin MoS2 film on TiO2-glass substrate improves photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in the visible light due to the efficient absorption of visible photon of MoS2 few layers and the transfer of electrons from MoS2 to TiO2. All MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure thin films exhibit higher visible light photocatalytic activity than that of pure MoS2 and TiO2 counterparts. The best MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure thin film at MoS2 layer deposition time of 45 minutes can decompose about 60% MB solution after 150 minutes under visible light irradiation. The mechanism of the enhancement for visible-photocatalytic activity of MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure thin film was also discussed.},

By the cooperation of two-step production route, including (1) enzymatic pretreatment using cellulase from Trichoderma viride and (2) mechanical grinding twice, a shorter cellulose nanofiber was fabricated. The influence of enzymatic charge and hydrolysis time on cellulose fibers was analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). SEM images revealed that the surface morphology change, effective diameter sharpening, and length shearing of cellulose fibers are as a result of cellulase hydrolysis. The XRD suggested that the cellulase acted on the amorphous regions more strongly than the crystalline domains during layer-by-layer hydrolysis. The enzymatic charge and hydrolysis time significantly affected the yields and hydrolysis products concentration. The enzymatic pretreatment assisted mechanical grinding could improve the uniformity of CNF and helped to obtain CNF with exact length according to the requirement for special applications.},

applicability in a wide range of mathematical-scientific fields (e.g.,

chemical engineering for interfacial flow studies). Here, we focus on
phase field equations in strongly heterogeneous materials with perforations
such as porous media. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first derivation of error estimates for
fourth order, homogenized, and nonlinear evolution equations. Our fourth order
problem induces a slightly lower convergence rate, i.e.,
$epsilon^{1/4}$, where $epsilon$ denotes the material's specific
heterogeneity, than established for second order elliptic problems (e.g., [V. Zhikov, Dokl. Math., 73 (2006), pp. 96--99, https://doi.org/10.1134/S1064562406010261.])

To do so, we propose a new method of order book representation, and decompose the problem of order book modeling into two subproblems: dynamics of a continuous-time double auction system with a fixed reference price; interactions between the double auction system and the reference price movements. State dependency is included in our framework by allowing order flow intensities to depend on the order book state. Furthermore, contrary to most existing models, the impact of the order book updates on the reference price dynamic is not assumed to be instantaneous. We first prove under general assumptions the ergodicity of our system. Then we deduce the convergence towards a Brownian motion of the rescaled price process.},

abstract = {Numerous problems involving gradient-driven transport processese.g., Fourier's and Darcy's lawin heterogeneous materials concern a physical domain that is much larger than the scale at which the coefficients vary spatially. To overcome the prohibitive computational cost associated with such problems, the well-established Distributed Microstructure Model (DMM) provides a two-scale description of the transport process that produces a computationally cheap approximation to the fine-scale solution. This is achieved via the introduction of sparsely distributed micro-cells that together resolve small patches of the fine-scale structure: a macroscopic equation with an effective coefficient describes the global transport and a microscopic equation governs the local transport within each micro-cell. In this paper, we propose a new formulation, the Extended Distributed Microstructure Model (EDMM), where the macroscopic flux is instead defined as the average of the microscopic fluxes within the micro-cells. This avoids the need for any effective parameters and more accurately accounts for a non-equilibrium field in the micro-cells. Another important contribution of the work is the presentation of a new and improved numerical scheme for performing the two-scale computations using control volume, Krylov subspace and parallel computing techniques. Numerical tests are carried out on two challenging test problems: heat conduction in a composite medium and unsaturated water flow in heterogeneous soils. The results indicate that while DMM is more efficient, EDMM is more accurate and is able to capture additional fine-scale features in the solution.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of detecting the presence of nanoparticles in noisy transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images and then fitting each nanoparticle with an elliptic shape model. In order to achieve robustness while handling low contrast and high noise in the TEM images, we propose an approach to fuse two kinds of complementary image information, namely, the pixel intensity and the gradient (the first derivative in intensity). Our approach entails two main steps: 1) the first step is to, after necessary pre-processing, employ both intensity-based information and gradient-based information to process the same TEM image and produce two independent sets of results and 2) the subsequent step is to formulate a binary integer programming (BIP) problem for conflict resolution among the two sets of results. Solving the BIP problem determines the final nanoparticle identification. We apply our method to a set of TEM images taken under different microscopic resolutions and noise levels. The empirical results show the merit of the proposed method. It can process a TEM image of  $1024times 1024$  pixels in a few minutes, and the processed outcomes appear rather robust.},

abstract = {Model microscopic spreading behaviors for multi-scale diffusion dynamics prediction.Use unidirectional label propagation for diffusion process reproduction.Identify the most influential factors and the principle driving mechanisms.Use SFBS for independent and effective features selection. Information diffusion has become ubiquitous in various complex networks recently. Despite understanding information diffusion process being of utmost important to optimize network structure and regulate network function, the propagation mechanism of information diffusion is essentially unclear. Here we focus on the evolution prediction of information diffusion process. A problem typically encountered when exploiting traditional diffusion prediction methods is the limitedness of information available on diffusion graph, which hinders them from widespread use. This paper develops a novel prediction method, multi-scale diffusion prediction (MScaleDP). MScaleDP aggregates microscopic spreading modules of individual nodes using a unidirectional label propagation algorithm for macroscopic diffusion prediction, in which the label selection mechanism corresponds to the microscopic spreading decision-making. Through microscopic spreading behavior modeling, the underlying influential factors and the principal driving mechanisms of diffusion process are identified. Moreover, we find that the accuracy of spreading behavior estimation does not always increase with the growth of the feature number. We also find that the accuracy of spreading behavior estimation is not strongly correlated with the estimation model when sufficient features are considered. Our method is successfully tested on microblogging network, and represents a valuable tool for gaining insights on information diffusion process.},

abstract = {This study presents the development of an alternative noise current term and novel voltage-dependent current noise algorithm for conductance-based stochastic auditory nerve fibre (ANF) models. ANFs are known to have significant variance in threshold stimulus which affects temporal characteristics such as latency. This variance is primarily caused by the stochastic behaviour or microscopic fluctuations of the node of Ranvier's voltage-dependent sodium channels of which the intensity is a function of membrane voltage. Though easy to implement and low in computational cost, existing current noise models have two deficiencies: it is independent of membrane voltage, and it is unable to inherently determine the noise intensity required to produce in vivo measured discharge probability functions. The proposed algorithm overcomes these deficiencies while maintaining its low computational cost and ease of implementation compared to other conductance and Markovian-based stochastic models. The algorithm is applied to a Hodgkin---Huxley-based compartmental cat ANF model and validated via comparison of the threshold probability and latency distributions to measured cat ANF data. Simulation results show the algorithm's adherence to in vivo stochastic fibre characteristics such as an exponential relationship between the membrane noise and transmembrane voltage, a negative linear relationship between the log of the relative spread of the discharge probability and the log of the fibre diameter and a decrease in latency with an increase in stimulus intensity.},

The structure and morphology of the prepared PEG coated MNPs samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis TGA, and the high resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM. In this study, all samples demonstrated hydrodynamic size in the range of 32 to 43 nm with narrow size distribution. In addition, the magnetic properties of resultant samples were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer VSM to reveal the superparamagnetic behaviour with saturation magnetization. The saturation magnetization of PEG coated MNPs samples was in the range of 63 to 66 emu/g at 300 K. Interestingly, it was found that 1.0 g of PEG coated MNPs exhibited high colloidal stability in a basic solution pH = 10 and nitrile NBR latex up to 21 days as compared to the unmodified MNPs during the sedimentation test.},

After the adsorption process, changes in both morphology and composition were detected using a scanning electron microscope SEM equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray EDX system, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS analysis. The experimental evidence showed that ZnII liberation from MOF-5 structure was provoked by the water effect demonstrating that PbII removal is not due to ionic exchange with Zn. A kinetic study showed that PbII removal was carried out in 30 min with a behavior of pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The experimental data on PbII adsorption were adequately fit by both the Langmuir and BET isotherm models with maximum adsorption capacities of 658.5 and 412.7 mg/g, respectively, at pH 5 and 45°C. The results of this work demonstrate that the use of MOF-5 has great potential for applications in environmental protection, especially regarding the removal of the lead present in industrial wastewaters and tap waters.},

The scanning electron microscope SEM showed that the MDOS coupling agent could improve the compatibility between TiO2 nanoparticles and XLPE matrix to some extent and reduce the agglomeration of TiO2 nanoparticles compared with unmodified TiO2 nanoparticles; the volume resistivity testing indicated that the volume resistivity of TiO2/XLPE nanocomposites was higher than Pure-XLPE and increased with the increase of filling concentrations.

Conductive atomic force microscope (CAFM) technique is among the most promising tools for the identification and analysis of TDs in a nanoscale range although obtaining reliable quantitative data requires precise controls over the measurements conditions.

abstract = {In this paper, the process of moving rough cylindrical bacteria micro/nanoparticles on a smooth substrate by means of an atomic force microscope's (AFM) probe has been investigated. For this purpose, three common adhesion models of Rumpf, Rabinovich, and Cooper have been further developed in the form of multiasperity contact models and with regards to the cylindrical geometry of bacteria nanoparticles. The number of asperities in contact and also the areas of contact between nanoparticle/substrate and nanoparticle/AFM probe tip have been calculated. Then, a dynamic model for simulating rough cylindrical nanoparticles displacement on a smooth substrate has been presented and adhesive forces obtained from the aforementioned three models have been employed in this model to determine the critical force and time values for onset of rolling and sliding of particles on the substrate. Then, the effect of geometrical and roughness parameters on critical forces has been investigated. The simulation results have shown that critical forces required for pushing a rough particle are less than a smooth one. Also, the simulation results indicated that with increasing particle radius, the critical sliding force increases while the critical rolling force diminishes. For the results to be more realistic, simulations have been performed based on the roughness and geometrical parameters extracted from topographical images of bacteria micro/nanoparticles. For this purpose, two different bacteria samples were obtained and after preparing them, the topographic images of these samples were acquired by means of the AFM. Then, the roughness and geometrical parameters of these particles were extracted from the topographic images and using these parameters the manipulation process was simulated for these particles. The simulation results indicate that the maximum difference between Rumpf and Rabinovich models is 8%, so these model results are in a good agreement. Finally, the models developed in this research were validated by comparing the results with the findings of a research on gold nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Layered double hydroxides (LDH) are very used as fillers in polymer nanocomposites research. They cannot be used in their pristine form (magnesium and aluminum hydroxycarbonates) because they exhibit strong interlayer electrostatic interactions and tight basal spacings so that they require the intercalation of organic anions into clay galleries. The organic modification of LDH increases the filler-polymer compatibility, enlarges the basal spacing of the lamellae (making easier the insertion of the polymeric chains into the gallery), and promotes the exfoliation of the filler into the polymeric matrix. Organically modified LDH/polymer nanocomposites exhibit improved mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties when they are compared with pristine polymers or conventional composites. Moreover, the incorporation of LDH allows us to obtain materials with specific functionalities. For example, the intercalation of antimicrobial molecules into LDH (such as benzoate or stearate) and the use of the modified nanoparticles as fillers results in nanocomposites with antimicrobial activity. In this paper, several benzoate and/or stearate LDH/polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites have been produced for food packaging applications. The O2 permeability coefficient of the nanocomposite named 1.5% o-benzoate/1.5% o-stearate LDH/PP/3% PP-g-MAH reduces by 20% compared to unfilled PP and 30% compared to unfilled PP/3%PP-g-MAH. It is accepted that in such a nanocomposite, the lamellar structure of LDH creates a more tortuous path for the progress of oxygen molecules reducing the gas diffusion. For the novel nanocomposite material, the physical, morphological, mechanical, and gas barrier properties have been measured and the antimicrobial effect has been evaluated. In this paper, some benzoate LDH/polyurethane foam (PU) nanocomposites have been also produced. The filler dispersion into the PU has been investigated by scanning electronic microscopy. It was observed that organic LDH particles were uniformly dispersed into the walls of cells, forming small aggregates. The morphological properties of the foam have been analyzed by nanotomography. LDH/PU nanocomposite showed antibacterial and improved mechanical properties.},

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to analyse the particle morphology and the mean diameter yielded by the different synthesis parameters. Daily DLS measurements were also performed to monitor the expected swelling of the particles in a buffer solution, up to four days of storage. The experimental findings showed that submicrometric chitosan particles, with an average diameter in the range 150–400&nbsp;nm, could be successfully produced, with both chitosan molecular weight and concentration affecting the particle size. Moreover, the smallest particles, among those synthesized, were found to be stable in water solutions up to three days. This seems to suggest the potential of the investigated particles for short-term biomedical applications, e.g., controlled drug delivery over time windows ranging from hours to days.},

abstract = {A new second-order two-scale (SOTS) asymptotic analysis method is presented for the heat conduction problems concerning composite materials with periodic configuration under the coordinate transformation. The heat conduction problems are solved on the transformed regular domain with quasi-periodic structure in the general curvilinear coordinate system. By the asymptotic expansion, the cell problems, effective material coefficients and homogenized heat conduction problems are obtained successively. The main characteristic of the approximate model is that each cell problem defined on the microscopic cell domain is associated with the macroscopic coordinate. The error estimation of the asymptotic analysis method is established on some regularity hypothesis. Some common coordinate transformations are discussed and the reduced SOTS solutions are presented. Especially by considering the general one-dimensional problem, the explicit expressions of the SOTS solutions are derived and stronger error estimation is presented. Finally, the corresponding finite element algorithms are presented and numerical results are analyzed. The numerical errors presented agree well with the theoretical prediction, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the second-order asymptotic analysis method. By the coordinate transformation, the asymptotic analysis method can be extended to more general domain with periodic microscopic structures.},

Graphene was grown over copper foils by decomposition of acetylene in a standard chemical vapor deposition apparatus. Graphene was subsequently transferred to a silicon substrate, on which the titanium dioxide was grown to form a TiO2/FLG/SiO2/Si composite. The formation of each layered material was verified by Raman spectroscopy and the morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The photoelectrochemical evaluation of the resulting composite, using it as a photoanode, was accomplished with a potentiostat, a solar simulator, and a three-electrode configuration. The electrochemical response indicates that the new composite preserves the average photoactive properties of the base material and at the same time shows a singular transient response where explicit benefits seem to be derived from the FLG/TiO2 combination.},

abstract = {We develop a new multiscale finite element method for the
Laplace equation with oscillating Neumann boundary
conditions on rough boundaries.
The key point is the introduction of a new boundary condition that incorporates both the microscopically geometrical and physical information of the rough boundary. Our approach applies to problems posed on a domain with a rough boundary as well as oscillating boundary conditions.
We prove the method has a linear convergence rate in the energy norm with a weak resonance term for periodic roughness. Numerical results are reported for both periodic and nonperiodic roughness.},

We first aim to gain insight into the properties of the solutions of the macroscopic model: we provide an existence result under structural conditions for the external potential and perform numerical simulations. The numerical study of the macroscopic model reveals interesting features such as the emergence of a buckling phenomenon. Physical properties of the macroscopic fiber network are then deduced. We finally propose a numerical comparison between the macroscopic model and the microscopic one, a starting point for the derivation of the macroscopic equations. The numerical simulations reveal a good agreement between both models, providing we adapt the regime of study according to the model parameters.},

abstract = {Meissner corpuscles are the fast adapting type I (FA-I) mechanoreceptor that locates at the dermal papillae of skin. The Meissner corpuscle is well known for its complex structure, consisting of spiral axons, lamellar cells, and a collagen capsule. Fluorescent microscopy has become a convenient method for observing the Meissner corpuscle and its inner structure. This method requires preparing samples with fingertip cross-sections and performing antibody staining before observation. Various kinds of microscopy can be used for observation, such as confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Although the anatomical shape, distribution, and components of Meissner corpuscle are recognized, they have been mostly determined from observations of fixed tissues. Therefore, knowledge of mechanical transduction is limited by the lack of in vivo experiments and individual differences among samples. In this study, we propose a novel less invasive imaging method that incorporates a staining technique with lipophilic carbocyanine  $text{DiOC}_{16}(3)$  and two-photon microscopy. This combination allows us to repetitively observe the Meissner corpuscle in a living mouse.},

CuO films were grown on glass substrates via SILAR (Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction) method. Films were annealed at 200°C and 400°C in ambient air for 45min. Scanning electron microscopy analysis confirmed the plate-like morphology of CuO nanostructures with average plate thickness increasing from 30nm to 70nm with increasing annealing temperature. X-ray diffraction studies of the films revealed that the average crystallite sizes were around 17-22nm. The bandgap values were calculated from the UV-visible absorbance spectrum and it was determined that the annealing process lowered the bandgap valued from 1.46eV to 1.38eV suggesting that the resistivity would also decrease. The prospect of sweat electrolyte sensing properties of CuO films was studied by drop cast application of different concentrations of artificial sweat solutions. We found that annealing process increases the sensitivity of sweat electrolyte level detection for particularly low concentration artificial sweat solutions.

abstract = {The demand of high quality confocal microscopic images is increasing for critical tasks such as study of living tissues at cellular resolution and disease diagnosis. The results of such tasks are often affected by the blur introduced in microscopic images. Removal of blur from multi-focus microscopic images without deteriorating their visual quality is a challenging task. The confocal microscopic images are obtained by averaging their frames. This process introduces the blurring artefacts that degrade the quality of microscopic images. In this work, we presented learning-based intelligent fusion to minimize the blurring artefacts of confocal microscopic images. The quality of these images is improved using the proposed individual and ensemble fusion models. In the proposed scheme, block-based features are extracted from the blurred images. These informative features are then used to develop the individual models that construct the fused images using their fusion maps. The predicted information of the individual fusion maps is then combined to construct the ensemble-based fused image. The proposed learning-based approach has demonstrated improved quantitative and qualitative results compared to rule-based fusion approaches. The proposed fusion models can be employed as a useful tool in confocal microscopy frames to generate the improved quality images with reduced blurring artefacts.},

abstract = {Adhesive interactions between particles are important in situations ranging from technological applications like atomic force microscopy to the initial stages of planet formation. In this work, we present a body force formulation with first-order convergence rate for the finite element analysis of adhesive interactions due to van der Waals force, which overcomes the restrictions of the commonly used surface force formulation. Though the classical Newton-Raphson method offers second-order convergence, substantial reduction in the computational cost per iteration justifies the use of present method in this case. First we discuss the general formulation, which is later modified for special cases like handling symmetry. We present a convenient implementation for reflective symmetry formulation, which can be easily extended to problems with any number of planes of symmetry. The axisymmetric formulation developed in this work provides significant computational benefits compared to a full three-dimensional formulation. The comparison of the results of our analyses with analytical solutions is provided for a number of benchmark problems. We also provide a comparison among general, reflective-symmetry and axisymmetric formulations in terms of accuracy and computational speed. HighlightsA body-force formulation for FEA of adhesive interactions is presented.Special considerations like handling symmetry are discussed.Axisymmetric formulation developed gives significant computational advantages.The formulation is validated by comparing with analytical solutions.Case studies illustrating salient features of the formulation are presented.},

NCC has many benefits such as high aspect ratio, biodegradability, and high number of hydroxyl groups which offer great opportunities for modification. In this study, the NCC derived from empty fruit bunches (EFB) was modified with aminosilane, 3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyl-dimethoxymethylsilane (AEAPDMS), and the characterization was performed to investigate the potential as carbon dioxide (CO2) capture. Modification of NCC with AEAPDMS was carried out in water/ethanol solvent (80/20) (v/v) with a ratio of NCC to aminosilane of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3, and 1 : 4 w/w%. The effects of AEAPDMS on NCC were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, elemental analysis (CHNS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The existence of AEAPDMS onto NCC was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy as the new peaks of NH2 were bending and wagging, and Si-CH3 appeared. The thermal stability of NCC increased after modification due to the interaction with AEAPDMS. The elemental analysis result showed that the nitrogen content increased with an enhancement ratio of the modifiers. The XRD indicated that the crystallinity decreased while the rod-like geometry of NCC was maintained after amorphous AEAPDMS grafted on the NCC. Since AEAPDMS can be grafted on the NCC, the sample is applicable as CO2 capture.},

abstract = {Modeling and analyzing the behaviors and characteristics of crowds in emergency is a challenging task with significant practical meanings. In this paper, a fuzzy logic approach is proposed to describe crowd evacuation behaviors, taking into account the effect of assailants. First, the microscopic pedestrian model and the assailant model are developed according to their different intentions in evacuation scenarios. Pedestrians are further divided into three categories depending upon whether they are affected by assailants. The individual's behaviors are determined by the integration of recommendations of local obstacle-avoiding behavior, regional path-searching behavior, and global goal-seeking behavior with adjustable weighting factors, which are automatically adjusted based on the perceptual information obtained from the complex interaction with surrounding environments. Then, the proposed pedestrian model is validated by comparing the simulated fundamental diagram with a large variety of empirical and experimental data. Finally, simulations in a hall with a single exit are implemented. It is shown that the model can truly reappear typical collective phenomena such as “arching and clogging” and “faster-is-slower effect.” The variations of the model and scenario parameters, such as pedestrian's desired speed, exit width, assailant's desired speed, and duration of attack, greatly influence the evacuation efficiency. In addition, a novel “circuity phenomenon,” i.e., pedestrians will give up the direction of goal when they encounter assailants or they see assailants and, at the same time, perceive a very crowded exit, is observed in crowd evacuation simulations.},

abstract = {Silver nanoparticles or nanoclusters are quite sensitive to light exposure. In particular, irradiation in the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) region brings about a drastic modification of their optical properties due to growth and reshaping of the nanoparticles. In order to obtain luminescent colloids, small silver colloidal nanoparticles were prepared in chloroform using vinylpyrrolidone oligomers as capping agent and their luminescence properties were used to control their stability upon prolonged exposure to visible light. The polymeric shell around the metal clusters was hardened through photo-cross-linking by UV light. This process did not alter the morphology and the optical properties of the nanoparticles but greatly improved the particle photostability as confirmed also by confocal laser scanning microscopy measurements. The data clearly show that UV curing of the stabilizing layer could be a simple postsynthetic procedure to obtain materials with stable properties.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal synthesis of CeO2 was optimized on two reactant concentrations and synthesis temperature and duration, in order to achieve material having the greatest specific surface area (SSA). Taguchi method of experimental design was employed in evaluation of the relative importance of synthesis parameters. CeO2 nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and scanning electron microscopy. Optimum conditions for obtaining particles with greater SSA were calculated according to Taguchi s model the-higher-the-better. Synthesis temperature was found to be the only parameter significant for enabling nanoparticles with greater SSA. Mesoporous nanocrystalline ceria with SSA as great as 226 m2 g 1 was achieved, which is unprecedented for the hydrothermally synthesized ceria. The reason for this achievement was found in temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient which, when low, favors nucleation yielding with fine particles, while when high it favors crystal growth and formation of one-dimensional structures. The occurrence of 1D-structure in sample exhibiting the smallest SSA was confirmed. Very fine crystallites with crystallite size as low as 5.9 nm have been obtained being roughly inverse proportional to SSA. Selected samples were tested as catalyst for soot oxidation. Catalyst morphology turned out to be decisive factor for catalytic activity.},

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals microstructural analysis of the MWNT-Ag hybrids. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra prove the interactions between the AgNP and carboxyl groups of the MWNT. Raman spectra reveal that the D- to G-band intensity ratios ID/IG and ID′/IG increase upon the deposition of AgNP onto the surface of the MWNT. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the MWNT-Ag hybrids decompose at a much faster rate and the weight loss decreased considerably due to the presence of AgNP. Nonlinearity of current-voltage (I-V) curves indicates that electrical transport of pristine MWNT is enhanced when AgNP is induced as charge carriers in the MWNT-Ag hybrids. The threshold voltage Vth value for the MWNT doped with a maximum of 70 vol% of AgNP was substantially reduced by 65% relative to the pristine MWNT. The MWNT-Ag hybrids have a favourable electrical characteristic with a low threshold voltage that shows enhancement mode for field-effect transistor (FET) applications.},

The characteristics of photocatalysts by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) showed that increasing the calcination temperature from 400 to 900 C resulted in change of photocatalytic activity under UV-Vis light. Moreover, the amount of WO3 crystalline phase and amorphous phase in WO3/TiO2 aggregates, as revealed by XRD analysis, was dependent on the calcination temperature. The WO3/TiO2 samples with 8 mol% load of WO3 in respect to TiO2 calcinated at 500 and 800 C possess the highest photocatalytic activity in reaction of phenol degradation, which is about 1.2 and 1.5 times that with calcination at 400 C. The increase in calcination temperature above 400 C resulted in increase of WO3 crystallinity and reduction of the amount of amorphous phase in the nanocomposite structure. Moreover, the annealing of nanocomposites above 700 C decreases the value of optical band gap energies of obtained WO3/TiO2 nanomaterials.},

abstract = {We present fabrication and testing of bottom-emitting organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels based on flip-chip assembly and non-destructive scanning. In this method, the OLED and electric circuits are fabricated on separate substrates and interconnected by low temperature assembly to create a high-performance bottom-emitting OLED including other functions such as thin-film transistor (TFT) circuits. The low temperature assembly process consists of two steps. First, an OLED substrate and encapsulation glass with circuits are bonded at 100°C via AuAu bond. Encapsulation glass is utilized for the functional substrate with circuits. Next, the bonded panel is sealed by capillary underfill within and by applying and curing seal materials to the panel edge. The fabricated OLED was non-destructively evaluated by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). The SAM image shows all 500µm Au bumps were bonded to Au pads, indicating that OLED and encapsulation substrates were assembled. Electroluminescence of the OLED was demonstrated by applying voltage. Stable current-luminance characteristics were obtained for the fabricated OLED with an operating voltage of 3.25V. The results indicate that the proposed fabrication is available for bottom-emitting OLED controlled by TFT circuits. In future, the assembly process can be widely applied to other flexible organic electronic devices with roll assembly by altering OLED or circuits with other devices because this is a simple pressure method with low temperature, achieving encapsulation at same time. OLED panel assembled by flip-chip bonding and capillary-driven filling is proposed.Assembly was successfully carried out at 100°C with AuAu low temperature bonding.Stable current flow and electro-luminescence was obtained from assembled OLED panel.Flip-chip assembly is effective for fabricating OLED panel with large device area.},

abstract = {The dry etching characteristics of phase change material GeTe were investigated in inductively coupled BCl3/Ar plasma. By changing gas ratio, gas pressure, substrate bias power, and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source power, respectively, various characteristics of GeTe films were investigated about surface roughness, etch rate and profiles. Etching damage was studied by analyzing the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results of etched blank GeTe films. We found that the etch rate increases with the increase of BCl3 content and substrate bias power. However, it first increases then decreases with the increase of gas pressure and ICP power. Surface becomes smooth with the increase of gas pressure, but the higher power and substrate bias power lead rougher surface. Little C contamination, oxidation and halogenated layer were remained on the surface during etching process, which can be removed easily by Ar+ sputtering. The stoichiometric ratio of GeTe is stable after being sputtered in tens of seconds on the etched surface, indicating the etching damage is low. The work we did was used to investigate the etching characteristics of GeTe films in inductively coupled BCl3/Ar plasma with various parameters, such as: substrate bias power, gas-mixing ratio, gas pressure and ICP power. By optimizing the etching parameters, we can achieve high etch rate, smooth surface, vertical sidewalls, highly anisotropic profiles. The Ge/Te ratio is unstable on the surface, and it will be stable after tens of seconds Ar+ sputtering by XPS results. The etching profile and depth were measured by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as shown in the graphical. The surface roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It can be found the surface roughness increases with both the bias and ICP powers but to decrease with the gas pressure.

abstract = {We use an edge based active contour for sperm head segmentation.We propose new algorithms to locate the sperm tail and remove the midpiece.Our segmentation method achieves more than 92% overlap with hand segmented ground truth for sperm heads.Our segmentation method achieves a higher Dice coefficient and lower dispersion compared to the current state-of-the-art.Our tail detection algorithm correctly locates the tail with the rate of 96%. Background and objectiveManual assessment of sperm morphology is subjective and error prone so developing automatic methods is vital for a more accurate assessment. The first step in automatic evaluation of sperm morphology is sperm head detection and segmentation. In this paper a complete framework for automatic sperm head detection and segmentation is presented. MethodsAfter an initial thresholding step, the histogram of the Hue channel of HSV color space is used, in addition to size criterion, to discriminate sperm heads in microscopic images. To achieve an improved segmentation of sperm heads, an edge-based active contour method is used. Also a novel tail point detection method is proposed to refine the segmentation by locating and removing the midpiece from the segmented head. An algorithm is also proposed to separate the acrosome and nucleus using morphological operations. Dice coefficient is used to evaluate the segmentation performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available dataset. ResultsThe proposed method has achieved segmentation accuracy of 0.92 for sperm heads, 0.84 for acrosomes and 0.87 for nuclei, with the standard deviation of 0.05, which significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Also our tail detection method achieved true detection rate of 96%. ConclusionsIn this paper we presented a complete framework for sperm detection and segmentation which is totally automatic. It is shown that using active contours can improve the segmentation results of sperm heads. Our proposed algorithms for tail detection and midpiece removal further improved the segmentation results. The results indicate that our method achieved higher Dice coefficients with less dispersion compared to the existing solutions.},

abstract = {In order to design the microstructure of metamaterials showing high toughness in extension (property to be shared with muscles), it has been recently proposed (Dell’Isola et&nbsp;al. in Z Angew Math Phys 66(6):3473–3498, 2015) to consider pantographic structures. It is possible to model such structures at a suitably small length scale (resolving in detail the interconnecting pivots/cylinders) using a standard Cauchy first gradient theory. However, the computational costs for such modelling choice are not allowing for the study of more complex mechanical systems including for instance many pantographic substructures. The microscopic model considered here is a quadratic isotropic Saint-Venant first gradient continuum including geometric nonlinearities and characterized by two Lam\'{e} parameters. The introduced macroscopic two-dimensional model for pantographic sheets is characterized by a deformation energy quadratic both in the first and second gradient of placement. However, as underlined in Dell’Isola et&nbsp;al. (Proc R Soc Lond A 472(2185):20150790, 2016), it is needed that the second gradient stiffness depends on the first gradient of placement if large deformations and large displacements configurations must be described. The numerical identification procedure presented in this paper consists in fitting the macro-constitutive parameters using several numerical simulations performed with the micro-model. The parameters obtained by the best fit identification in few deformation problems fit very well also in many others, showing that the reduced proposed model is suitable to get an effective model at relevantly lower computational effort. The presented numerical evidences suggest that a rigorous mathematical homogenization result most likely holds.},

We compute  different mesoscopic and macroscopic quantities from the microscopic unknowns (cell densities) and relate them to experimental cell kinetic indexes. We study the expression of reaching  times corresponding to characteristic cellular transitions in a  particle-like reduction of the original model.

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanolithography is one of the commonly used techniques to fabricate graphene devices on different substrates. However, the patterned graphene varies with different substrate materials. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that the required force to pattern graphene and the trench morphology is highly dependent on the substrate hardness and the interfacial adhesion energy between graphene and the substrate. A strong correlation is seen between the cutting force and the average width of the fractured graphene on a variety of substrates. In our experiments, we show that graphene trenches with ultrasmooth edges and narrow width down to 30&nbsp;nm can be created on soft substrates like gold under small applied forces, while only rough and wide trenches can be obtained on hard substrates (Si and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

To be specific, we derive a new expression for the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the minimum eigenvalue ( λ min ) of W . The c.d.f. is expressed as the determinant of a square matrix, the size of which depends only on the difference m - n . This further facilitates the analysis of the microscopic limit of the minimum eigenvalue. The microscopic limit takes the form of the determinant of a square matrix with its entries expressed in terms of the modified Bessel functions of the first kind. We also develop a moment generating function based approach to derive the probability density function of the random variable tr ( W ) / λ min , where tr ( \'{z} ) denotes the trace of a square matrix. Moreover, we establish that, as m , n \'{z} ∞ with m - n fixed, tr ( W ) / λ min scales like n 3 . Finally, we find the average of the reciprocal of the characteristic polynomial det z I n + W , | arg z | &lt; π , where I n and det \'{z} denote the identity matrix of size n and the determinant, respectively.},

abstract = {We present a simple fabrication method for microfluidic channels in which all walls consist of parylene. Only one parylene deposition step is required to achieve monolithical integration of fully-sealed parylene structures. Thus, the commonly used polymer-to-polymer bonding procedures are not needed. A pattern of grooves was etched into a silicon substrate, determining the shape and depth of the channels to be fabricated. A polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foil was affixed to the top of the wafer. After a single deposition step, a 15 µm-thick film of parylene C conformally coated all surfaces. The PVC foil was peeled off from the parylene surface leaving fully-sealed parylene channels embedded in the silicon. The channels were characterized optically and by scanning electron microscopy. Their functionality was verified by flow tests with polystyrene microbeads dispersed in deionized water and the robustness of the structures was confirmed by hydrostatic tests. The fabricated channels are shown to be fully sealed and mechanically stable.},

abstract = {In this work, the influence of substrate properties on the polarization of highly c-axis oriented aluminium nitride (AlN) thin films and as a consequence, on the piezoelectric properties and the wet-chemical etching behaviour is investigated. Therefore, 620 nm thin AlN layers are simultaneously sputter-deposited under nominal unheated substrate conditions on silicon (Si) substrates or on those covered with a sputter-deposited titanium (Ti) film. After wet-chemically etching in a phosphorous acid based solution at 80 °C different residues of AlN remain. Wet-chemical etching of AlN films deposited on Ti results in a high film porosity. In contrast, AlN layers on Si are either hardly attacked or the complete thin film is removed except some remaining conical shaped residues. Furthermore, we demonstrate a change in the measured electro-mechanical properties with changing maximum deposition temperature caused by a self-heating effect of the substrate during the AlN deposition process. The change in piezoelectric properties and the differing etching behaviour is caused by a change in polarity within the AlN layer. These domains are visualized by piezoresponse force microscopy measurements, and are in good agreement with the observed etching results. For layers with mixed polarization, the absolute values of the piezoelectric constant d33 are reduced due to the counteraction of piezoelectric domains with opposite polarization.},

abstract = {This paper reports the structure stability of Ti/Au two-layer micro-cantilevers with various aspect ratios based on the results obtained from a 3D optical microscope and FEM simulation. The cantilevers were fabricated by MEMS fabrication process. The movable structure stability was investigated by observing the shape of the Ti/Au two-layer micro-cantilevers with the Ti layer thickness of 0.1µm, and the Au layer thicknesses of 3µm, 10µm and 12µm. The length was varied from 100 to 1000µm. The results of the tip deflection observed from the 3D optical microscope were similar to those of the FEM simulation. The experimental results of the micro-cantilevers with the Au thickness of 12µm indicated the highest structure stability. In conclusion, these results revealed that the Ti/Au two-layer structure can enhance the stability and reliability of the movable structure. Display Omitted The structure stability of the Ti/Au two-layer micro-cantilevers was studied.The cantilevers had lengths from 100 to 1000 µm and thickness from 3 to 12 µm.The stability was low when the cantilever is long with a smaller thickness of 3µm.The stability was high for all of the cantilevers with thickness larger than 10 µm.The results confirmed the Ti/Au two-layer structure can improve the stability.},

abstract = {Diamond scanning probes are routinely used today for characterizing nanoelectronics device structures with electrical atomic force microscopy (AFM), in particular by scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM). As the most advanced devices are reaching sub-10nm dimensions soon, the diamond probes need to be further improved both in terms of spatial resolution (to resolve sub-nanometer features) and electrical conductivity (to probe also highly doped regions). Therefore, we have developed an improved microfabrication process based on 200-mm Si wafer technology for fabricating full diamond tips (FDTs) by the molding technique. The molded FDTs are integrated into metal cantilevers and are fixed to millimeter-size holder chips for probe handling. The key aspects of our improved fabrication process are higher-density seeding inside the pyramidal molds (~3.5E10cm-2) and the switch in diamond growth mode from nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) to microcrystalline diamond (MCD) leading to higher resolution and electrical conductivity. Another achievement of this work is the establishment of adequate physical and electrical tip characterization procedures allowing to quantitatively assess the tip performance. This work presents the fabrication scheme, shows manufactured probe devices and discusses probe characterization in detail. Display Omitted We present the fabrication process for full diamond tips (FDT) with sub-nanometer electrical resolution.We show that a higher tip sharpness is achieved via high-density seeding of the molds.The tip conductivity is improved by switching from nanocrystalline to microcrystalline diamond.We show that the wafer tip yield is strongly improved to 80-95%.},

abstract = {The paper presents a methodology for de-embedding scanning microwave microscopy (SMM) measurements, mainly for semiconductor characterization. Analytical modeling, a parametric study and experimental verification are presented. The proposed methodology is based on the analysis of system response in the linear scale, instead of the dB scale commonly utilized in RF measurements, and on expressing the standard calibration capacitances per unit area. In this way the total measured capacitance is determined by the tip area which is then obtained as a result of the model fitting on the experimental data. Additional evaluation is performed by a straightforward experimental comparison with the usually adopted technique that is based on the electrostatic force microscopy approach curve method. The results obtained by the application of both techniques on the same tip during the same experiment were found to be in good agreement and moreover allowed a detailed discussion on the features of each one of the two methodologies. The paper provides also in this way useful knowledge for the potential users in order to choose the most appropriate technique according to the corresponding SMM application. Display Omitted A methodology for de-embedding scanning microwave microscopy measurements is presented.The proposed analysis is based on the assessment of the SMM system response in the linear scale.The methodology is experimentally evaluated by a straightforward comparison with an EFM based calibration method.Based on the obtained results the features of each methodology are also discussed in details.The paper provides a full picture of the up to date available experimental techniques for de-embedding SMM measurements.},

The holographic recording technique based on four-wave mixing of the laser beams has been used to investigate the laser-induced change of the refractive index in the nano- and bioobjects-doped liquid crystal cells. The special accent has been given to novel nanostructured relief with vertically aligned carbon nanotubes at the interface: solid substrate-liquid crystal mesophase. It has been shown that this nanostructured relief influences the orienting ability of the liquid crystal molecules with good advantage. As a result, it provokes the orientation of the DNA.

The influence of different amounts of noble metals (1–5 mol-%) present on the microstructure as well as the photocatalytic property under 4-chlorophenol degradation was evaluated. The anatase phase was favored at low Pt content; however, the apparition of new phases after 3 mol-% (PtO) suggests a saturation lattice considering our solubility limit at 1 mol-%. Similar trend was observed when Pd was added to the TiO2 lattice. The as-prepared catalysts were deeply characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with the Rietveld Method, Raman spectroscopy, high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption analysis, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Unit-cell parameter of TiO2 phases varied from 30 to 93 vol-% depending on the amount of Pt or Pd added to the composite. HRTEM and HRSEM identified the phases in the catalysts and confirmed the nanometric size and morphology of the catalysts. An improvement in removal efficiency of 4-chlorophenol was obtained in all the specimens compared with the commercial Degussa P25, which can be explained in terms of phase composition and modification of the band gap.},

The morphology, size, compositions, and incorporation of zinc into hydroxyapatite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman scattering, and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the cytotoxicity of ZnHAp nanoparticles was tested on both E. coli bacteria and human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. The results showed that ZnHAp nanoparticles (HAp, 7ZnHAp, and 10ZnHAp) have slightly elongated morphologies with average diameters between 25 nm and 18 nm. On the other hand, a uniform and homogeneous distribution of the constituent elements (calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and oxygen) in the ZnHAp powder was noticed.

Moreover, it can be concluded that Zn doping at the tested concentrations is not inducing a specific prokaryote or eukaryote toxicity in HAp compounds.},

abstract = {We introduce a new model of parametric contours defined in a continuous fashion. Our curve model relies on Hermite spline interpolation and can easily generate curves with sharp discontinuities; it also grants direct access to the tangent at each location. With these two features, the Hermite snake distinguishes itself from classical spline-snake models and allows one to address certain bioimaging problems in a more efficient way. More precisely, the Hermite snake construction allows introducing sharp corners in the snake curve and designing directional energy functionals relying on local orientation information in the input image. Using the formalism of spline theory, the model is shown to meet practical requirements such as invariance to affine transformations and good approximation properties. Finally, the dependence on initial conditions and the robustness to the noise is studied on synthetic data in order to validate our Hermite snake model, and its usefulness is illustrated on real biological images acquired using brightfield, phase-contrast, differential-interference-contrast, and scanning-electron microscopy.},

abstract = {Those empirical properties exhibited by high frequency financial data, such as time-varying intensities and self-exciting features, make it a challenge to model appropriately the dynamics associated with, for instance, order arrival. To capture the microscopic structures pertaining to limit order books, this paper focuses on modeling high frequency financial data using Hawkes processes. Specifically, the model with power-law kernels is compared with the counterpart with exponential kernels, on the goodness of fit to the empirical data, based on a number of proposed quantities for statistical tests. Based on one-trading-day data of one representative stock, it is shown that Hawkes processes with power-law kernels are able to reproduce the intensity of jumps in the price processes more accurately, which suggests that they could serve as a realistic model for high frequency data on the level of microstructure.},

Image based subcellular localization of proteins is a challenging pattern recognition task and is of prime importance in understanding different functions of proteins. Extracting information about the protein's subcellular location using discriminative feature extraction strategies helps in understanding the behavior of different proteins under different circumstances.In this work, an intelligent prediction system for protein subcellular localization using fluorescence microscopy images is developed. The proposed prediction system IEH-GT uses a new feature extraction strategy and ensemble classification. The new feature extraction mechanism exploits statistical and Texton based image descriptors, whereas ensemble classification is performed using the majority voting based ensemble of SVMs. The novelty of IEH-GT prediction system lies (a) in the individual exploitation of the feature spaces generated from both individual Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs) and Texton images as well as (b) in the manner the extracted features are exploited using the learning capabilities of SVM, which is utilized as base classifier in majority voting based ensemble. In this work, the effect of the individual orientations of GLCMs and Texton images on the capability of protein-recognition is investigated.It is observed that GLCMs along different orientations characterize different information regarding intensity distribution and relative positions of pixels in a certain neighborhood. Similarly, the individually generated features from each Texton image help in reducing the overlapping information. The proposed IEH-GT prediction system is thus able to effectively exploit information about the patterns of intensity-variations of proteins. It is experimentally observed that due to the capability of the proposed IEH-GT system in differentiating diverse surface structures of proteins, the mis-predictions of similar proteins such as Golgpp and Golgia are substantially reduced.},

abstract = {In existing control techniques for optical tweezers, a target particle is directly trapped and manipulated by a single laser beam. However, a typical force generated by an optical trap is extremely small (on the order of piconewtons) and thus it is not sufficient to manipulate a large cell or object. Besides, the feasibility of optical manipulation also depends on the physical properties of the specimen. An opaque object or object with the same refractive index as the fluid media may not be trapped directly by the laser beam. Therefore, current control techniques for optical tweezers cannot be utilized to manipulate various types of cells or objects, including untrappable or large ones. In this paper, robotic control techniques are developed for optical tweezers to achieve grasping and manipulation of a microscopic particle, which is beyond the capability of a single optical trap. First, multiple laser beams are generated, and each laser beam is utilized to trap and drive one grasping particle to form a desired shape around the target particle. A grasping formation of trapped particles is thus generated to hold the target particle. Then the target particle is manipulated to a desired position by controlling the motorized stage. The proposed control strategy is particularly suitable for manipulation of large particles, or even untrappable cells or objects. Rigorous mathematical formulations have been developed to analyze the control system for grasping and manipulation of the microscopic particle. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed grasping and manipulation techniques.},

abstract = {The relevance of non-equilibrium phenomena, nonlinear behavior, gravitational effects and fluid compressibility in a wide range of problems related to high-temperature gas-dynamics, especially in thermal, mechanical and nuclear engineering, calls for a concerted approach using the tools of the kinetic theory of gases, statistical physics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and mathematical modeling in synergy with advanced numerical strategies for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The reason behind such a need is that in many instances of relevance in this field one witnesses a departure from canonical models and the resulting inadequacy of standard CFD approaches, especially those traditionally used to deal with thermal (buoyancy) convection problems. Starting from microscopic considerations and typical concepts of molecular dynamics, passing through the Boltzmann equation and its known solutions, we show how it is possible to remove past assumptions and elaborate an algorithm capable of targeting the broadest range of applications. Moving beyond the Boussinesq approximation, the Sutherland law and the principle of energy equipartition, the resulting method allows most of the fluid properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, heat capacity and diffusivity, etc.) to be derived in a rational and natural way while keeping empirical contamination to the minimum. Special attention is deserved as well to the well-known pressure issue. With the application of the socalled multiple pressure variables concept and a projection-like numerical approach, difficulties with such a term in the momentum equation are circumvented by allowing the hydrodynamic pressure to decouple from its thermodynamic counterpart. The final result is a flexible and modular framework that on the one hand is able to account for all the molecule (translational, rotational and vibrational) degrees of freedom and their effective excitation, and on the other hand can guarantee adequate interplay between molecular and macroscopic-level entities and processes. Performances are demonstrated by computing some incompressible and compressible benchmark test cases for thermal (gravitational) convection, which are then extended to the high-temperature regime taking advantage of the newly developed features.},

This method uses a variable aperture to change the relative proportions of specular refraction and scattering from the ceramic surface. The refractive index is calculated based on the specular reflectivity, which is obtained from the intensity ratio when the field of view is extrapolated to zero. Measurement of a TBC specimen resulted in a refractive index of 4.7, which was in good agreement with the refractive index of the ceramic material obtained by terahertz time-domain reflectometry. In addition, the surface roughness of the ceramic surface was obtained based on the frequency characteristics of the reflections from the ceramic surface and a reference metal plate. A surface roughness of 14 µm was obtained, which matched the results of microscopic observation of a TBC specimen whose coating was applied using the same lot as the specimen used in the measurement.},

abstract = {The solid state reaction of an ultra-thin Ni film (6nm) with Si:P epi layers (P: 0.7 to 4.0%), grown on 300-mm Si wafers, is studied as a function of different rapid thermal process (RTP) annealing temperatures (250-550 C) before and after applying a selective etch. The films are characterized using sheet resistance (Rs), mass, glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), X-ray reflectivity (XRR) atomic force, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy (AFM, SEM and TEM) analyses to follow the onset of the Ni reaction, the evolution of the different phases formed within the Ni-Si system and to investigate the NiSi film properties. Results demonstrate that, though the Ni conversion to form an intermediate Ni-rich silicide phase is complete at 300 C, showing no dependency on the P content, the complete transformation (to form low resistive NiSi) shows a temperature dependence with P content (350 C vs 400 C for 0.7% P and 2.0-4.0% P). Despite the delay in silicidation completion, the NiSi films exhibit comparable layer properties, for all P contents. All films show a uniform conversion with a similar volume expansion (2.1), good interface properties, comparable resistivity (18-20µ cm) and exhibit a smooth morphology with limited rms roughness increase (0.37 to 0.56nm). The thermal stability studies carried out on NiSi, post RTP anneals, shows a different Rs stability (650 and 575 C for 0.7% and 2.0-4.0% P), while the morphological and phase stability is found to be similar ( 500 C) for all P contents. The contact resistance measured using Circular Transmission Line Model (CTLM) structures for the synthesized NiSi films is found to be 4.8 10-8 and 1.2 10-8 cm2 for 0.7% and 4.0% P respectively, the latter meeting the requirements for 10-nm CMOS technology node as predicted by International Technology Road Map for Semiconductors (ITRS).

abstract = {Medical image recognition is an important task in both computer vision and computational biology. In the field of medical image classification, representing an image based on local binary patterns (LBP) descriptor has become popular. However, most existing LBP-based methods encode the binary patterns in a fixed neighborhood radius and ignore the spatial relationships among local patterns. The ignoring of the spatial relationships in the LBP will cause a poor performance in the process of capturing discriminative features for complex samples, such as medical images obtained by microscope. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a novel method to improve local binary patterns by assigning an adaptive neighborhood radius for each pixel. Based on these adaptive local binary patterns, we further propose a spatial adjacent histogram strategy to encode the micro-structures for image representation. An extensive set of evaluations are performed on four medical datasets which show that the proposed method significantly improves standard LBP and compares favorably with several other prevailing approaches.},

The prepared nano-particles were used during the preparation steps of the pullulan nanogel to obtain nanogel/combining metal/silica NPs to produce a composite materials. The nanoparticle size in dry (collapsed) state is estimated at 250 nm by SEM and TEM, and effect of temperature and pH on gel-nanoparticles was investigated by DLS and UV---vis spectrophotometry. The incorporation of the nanoparticles to cellulosic material was done by a simple pad dry-cure procedure from aqueous nanoparticle dispersion that contained a cross-linking agent.

Because of the high electrical resistivity of the thin a-Si0.60C0.40:H film higher than 2 MΩ cm, and in order to facilitate the chemical etching, a thin metallic film of high purity aluminum (Al) has been deposited under vacuum, follow-up of a thin palladium deposited under a grid to reduce attacked surface and reinforced solution etching.

Results show that the morphology of etched a-Si0.60C0.40:H surface evaluates with etching time and presents a spongy and macroporous layers. Where, the diameter of pore size increases with the increasing etching time. A humidity sensors were fabricated through evaporating coplanar interdigital gold electrodes on PASiC and the humidity sensing properties were tested, it show, that the measured resistance Au-PASiC structure, depends highly on the applied bias voltage. Finally, the sensing performances are attributed to the unique surface structure, morphology of the pore and its size, that provide an effective pathway for vapor transportation and enlarged the sensing area of Au-PASiC.},

It benefits from high resolution, high sensitivity and a low proximity effect. Here we present an investigation into HIBL on a novel, negative tone fullerene-derivative molecular resist. Analysis of large area exposures reveals a sensitivity of ~40µC/cm2 with a 30keV helium beam which is almost three orders of magnitude higher than the sensitivity of this resist to a 30keV electron beam. Sparse line features with line widths of 7.3nm are achieved on the ~10nm thick resist. The fabrication of 8.5 half-pitched lines with good feature separation and 6nm half-pitched lines with inferior but still resolvable separation is also shown in this study. Thus, sub-10nm patterning with small proximity effect is demonstrated using HIBL using standard processing conditions, establishing its potential as an alternative to EBL for rapid prototyping of beyond CMOS devices. Display Omitted A novel, negative tone fullerene molecular resist was patterned using helium ion beam lithography (HIBL).Almost 3 orders of magnitude sensitivity improvement was achieved in HIBL compared to EBL for this resist.Dense single-pixel, clearly seperated line features with a half pitch down to 8.5nm were fabricated.Sub-10nm patterning was achieved with high resolution, high sensitivity and low proximity effect.},

The purpose of this paper is to understand features of the China's listed e-commerce firms by testing Gibrat's law and Zipf's law within the Internet sectors. From a macroscopic perspective, with the approach of OLS estimation, Zipf's coefficient of the FSD is calculated to test whether Zipf's law holds. From a microscopic perspective, the relationship between e-commerce firm size and growth is explored by quantile regression method. The results indicate that from 2005 to 2014, Zipf's law cannot be rejected, with the relationship changing over time, Gibrat's law holds partly. It implies that competition status among China's e-commerce firms becomes more stable.},

In order to study the crystalline structure, samples were calcined at 500°C in an air-filled chamber. X-ray diffraction results indicated that as-prepared samples presented diffraction patterns of hydrate hydrogen titanate and those calcined at 500°C exhibited the TiO2-B and anatase phases, confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy results showed that the one-dimensional nanostructures had high contrast and uniform widths for those synthesised and calcined, indicating the formation of a phase of monocrystals. Besides, a proof of the antibacterial effect was carried out of the monoclinic phase of TiO2-B on Escherichia coli pure cultures, where the viability of the bacterium decreases in presence of TiO2-B nanostructures plus UV illumination. Monocrystals did not change after photocatalytic tests, suggesting a possible application as long-term antibacterial protection.},

The surface plasmon resonance at 440 nm for 30°C and 420 nm for both 50°C and 70°C measured using the UV-Vis spectrophotometer confirmed the formation of AgNPs synthesized using C. hirsuta CAgNPs. The functional groups responsible for the reduction and stabilization of the NPs were identified using Fourier Transform Infrared FTIR. The morphology, size, and elemental composition of the NPs were obtained using scanning electron microscope SEM, transmission electron microscope TEM, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDX. X-ray diffractometer was used to identify the phases and crystallinity of CAgNPs. Crystalline spherical NPs with average diameter of 6.9 ± 0.1 nm were successfully synthesized. The thermal analysis of CAgNPs was observed from DSC-TGA. The larvicidal results against the different larva instar stage of Culex quinquefasciatus gave LC50 = 4.43 ppm and LC90 = 8.37 ppm. This is the first study on the synthesis of AgNPs using C. hirsuta and its application against lymphatic filariasis vector. Hence, it is suggested that the C. hirsuta synthesized AgNPs would be environmentally benign in biological control of mosquito.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on efficient techniques based on AdaBoost and its hybrid (AdaBoost-SVM) classifiers for an automatic detection of the erythemato-squamous diseases (ESD). The classification of ESD requires an enormous amount of computational effort, as all the features of the diseases have more than 90 % commonality. Some of the approaches reported in literature are fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, neuro-fuzzy models and support vector machine. Recently, AdaBoost and its hybrid algorithms are widely used to enhance the accuracy of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose AdaBoost and its hybrid algorithms for diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases for the first time. User-friendly-interface is designed to assist dermatologists to estimate the ESD with the help of 34 features includes patient's histopathological and clinical data sets. Efficient interface design is based on the following steps: (1) feature selection for all the 34 parameters involved in the erythemato-squamous disease is done using association rule based Apriori algorithm, (2) association rules are used to find $$upalpha %$$ % of transactions (diseases) to meet $$upbeta %$$β% of the features of the diseases, (3) support value of all the subset of $$upalpha $$ transaction from $$upalpha %$$ % of transactions is found and the dominant subset is found using Apriori algorithm, and (4) AdaBoost and its hybrid classifiers are used to classify the diseases. In this paper, the real, modest, gentle and hybrid AdaBoost algorithms are implemented and tested with the dataset of 366 patients. The data preprocessing reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and improves the time complexity of the estimation of the diseases. Proposed methodologies are proved as a potential solution for diagnosing ESD with significant improvement in computational time and accuracy compared to other models discussed in the recent literature.},

abstract = {This paper is supposed to discuss the suitability to identify material parameters via nanoindentation of a viscoelastic dielectric thin film attached to a rigid substrate. In microelectronic components, polymer thin films used as packaging materials are gaining more and more importance, thus the full thermo-mechanical characterization of these materials is highly desired. Therefore, in this paper the problem of indentation into a geometrically confined thin film is indicated. With the help of FEM simulations, a function which accounts for the substrate influence in spherical nanoindentation is developed and integrated in the viscoelastic analysis of material parameters. By using a precise laser heat option as add on to the standard nanoindenter equipment (AgilentG200), time and temperature dependencies could be identified in micro scale and compared to conventional thermo-mechanical macroscopic thin film characterization. In both size scales, material models were established and verified in FEM simulation of sphere indentation. Transfering viscoelastic material characterization via nanoindentation onto thin polymer films over a wide range of temperatures and comparing microscopic and macroscopic results, as shown in this paper, is still not a well explored research field.},

abstract = {Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with integrated read-out and actuation are very useful tools for a wide variation of applications, especially in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) and lithography (SPL). They avoid the use of conventional optical beam deflection techniques or external excitation and are suitable for massively parallel scanning probe solutions and biochemical sensors. Such arrays of beams offer an increased throughput to scan large areas in SPM and SPL. However, the fabrication technology of such complex MEMS requires careful design of all components. This paper presents a comparison between analytical, numerical and experimental data of a cantilever with integrated thermal actuator and piezoresistive sensor, suitable for fast SPM and SPL. The focus of this work lies on the efficiency of the actuator, to achieve a high static displacement, which is required for an array operation. To maximize this displacement, two material compositions for a varying geometry of the beam's layers are analyzed. With a scanning electron microscope and a laser vibrometer an increased displacement of the beam about 10µm can be presented, which is in a good agreement with our theoretical predictions.

abstract = {Composite fibres with a matrix of polyethylene glycol PEG and cellulose nanofibrils CNF as reinforcing elements were produced using a capillary viscometer. Two types of CNF were employed: one based on carboxymethylated pulp fibres and the other on TEMPO-oxidized pulp. Part of the latter nanofibrils was also grafted with PEG in order to improve the compatibility between the CNF and the PEG matrix. The nominal CNF-content was kept at 10 or 30 weight-%. The composite fibres were characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy in addition to dynamic mechanical thermal analysis DMTA. Evaluation of the storage modulus indicated a clear reinforcing effect of the CNF, more pronounced in the case of the grafted CNF and depending on the amount of CNF. An interesting feature observed during the DMTA-measurements was that the fibrils within the composite fibres appeared to form a rather coherent and load-bearing network which was evident even after removing of the PEG-phase by melting. An analysis of the modulus of the composite fibres using a rather simple model indicated that the CNF were more efficient as reinforcing elements at lower concentrations which may be associated with a more pronounced aggregation as the volume fraction of CNF increased.},

Significant improvement was observed by blending only TPEE and virgin PBT polymers.

To study mechanical properties, flexural strength FS, flexural modulus FM, tensile strength TS, and tensile elongation TE were all investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis TGA and differential scanning calorimetry DSC were used to analyze the thermal properties, including the heat distortion temperature HDT, of the composites. Scanning electron microscopy SEM was used to observe the polymer fracture surface morphology. The dispersion of the clay and PTFE nanoparticles was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy TEM analysis.

It is determined that LaCoO3 phase is produced by a reaction of cobalt and lanthanum oxides, the latter produced by a two-step dehydration process of LaOH3. Finally, it was found that nearly stoichiometric LaCoO3 nanocrystals can be obtained at temperatures as low as 850°C. Nevertheless, whether higher calcination temperatures are used, appropriate reaction times and a controlled atmosphere are required in order to avoid formation of lanthanum carbonates and high density of lattice defects.},

The less the water content in the precursor, the smaller the size of ZnO NPs obtained.

The following parameters of the obtained ZnO NPs were determined: pycnometric density, specific surface area, phase purity, chemical composition, lattice parameters, average particle size, and particle size distribution. The average size of ZnO NPs was determined using Scherrer’s formula, Nanopowder XRD Processor Demo web application, by converting the results of the specific surface area, and TEM tests using the dark field technique.

abstract = {The fracture strength of poly-silicon as widely used membrane material in micro electro mechanical system applications has a critical impact in respect to design, function and reliability of e.g. pressure sensors or microphones. This circumstance necessitates the investigation of the fracture strength of these poly-silicon membranes. In this study the strength was investigated by experimental tests and numerical simulations. A new fracture test has been developed that applies a well-defined and almost constant stress within a certain region of the membrane and prevent a cracking of the membrane at the edge. The brittle behavior of poly-silicon needs a statistical evaluation of the results. To this end, a set of 45 membranes was tested at each of the three positions on the wafer in order to assure statistical accuracy and to evaluate the strength distribution across the wafer. The experimental loading tests were attended by scanning electron microscopy to examine the microstructure and the crack path. Using finite element simulation, the non-linear deformation behavior during membrane loading was analyzed and the fracture stresses were calculated. In the final step the obtained results were statistically evaluated by means of a two-parametric Weibull distribution. High values were found for the characteristic fracture stresses. They are in the range of 5400---6000 MPa.},

abstract = {A variety of near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM)-based lithography techniques have been developed for different applications through the use of a sub-wavelength aperture probe. The light transmission efficiency of an NSOM probe decreases markedly as the aperture diameter decreases. Apertureless NSOM yields a much higher resolution by concentrating the light field near the tip apex. However, far-field illumination by a focused laser beam deteriorates the resolution in optical patterning process. In this report, a tip-on-aperture (TOA) probe was fabricated to achieve high pattern resolution beyond that obtained from conventional NSOM probes. The shape of the probes was designed using the results of numerical analysis based on a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. The results showed that a probe with a triangular shape tip confined the electromagnetic energy with a 6.7 times larger intensity than the value obtained from a probe with a cylindrical shape tip. The TOA probes were fabricated by generating a triangular tip on a metal-coated NSOM probe using a focused ion beam (FIB) process. The resolution enhancement was experimentally demonstrated by the formation of the developed pattern on photo-resist. Display Omitted We proposed a plasmonic probe with a specially shaped tip on an aperture NSOM probe.A right triangle tip was selected as the optimal tip shape for optical resolution enhancement.The designed probe was effectively fabricated by FIB milling at different angles.Isolated line segments as narrow as 50nm were produced on photoresist film.},

abstract = {High-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) microscopy combined with multiplexing of fluorescent labels allows high-content analysis of large numbers of cell nuclei. The full automation of 3-D screening platforms necessitates image processing algorithms that can accurately and robustly delineate nuclei in images with little to no human intervention. Imaging-based high-content screening was originally developed as a powerful tool for drug discovery. However, cell confluency, complexity of nuclear staining as well as poor contrast between nuclei and background result in slow and unreliable 3-D image processing and therefore negatively affect the performance of studying a drug response.Here, we propose a new method, 3D-RSD, to delineate nuclei by means of 3-D radial symmetries and test it on high-resolution image data of human cancer cells treated by drugs. The nuclei detection performance was evaluated by means of manually generated ground truth from 2351 nuclei (27 confocal stacks). When compared to three other nuclei segmentation methods, 3D-RSD possessed a better true positive rate of 83.3% and F-score of 0.895 0.045 (p-value=0.047). Altogether, 3D-RSD is a method with a very good overall segmentation performance. Furthermore, implementation of radial symmetries offers good processing speed, and makes 3D-RSD less sensitive to staining patterns. In particular, the 3D-RSD method performs well in cell lines, which are often used in imaging-based HCS platforms and are afflicted by nuclear crowding and overlaps that hinder feature extraction. We developed a 3D-RSD algorithm to detect nuclei in 3-D image space.3D-RSD can effectively deal with highly confluent specimens.3D-RSD is fast and more accurate than three other reference methods, and can be used in high-content screening tasks to evaluate drug efficacy in human cancer cell lines.},

abstract = {Currently used ultrasonic welded joints for assembly and packaging of Li-Ion batteries have reliability concerns for automotive applications, as the battery is subjected to vibration and other mechanical loads. The sealing of the battery can is very critical for safety. Due to battery weld failures in recent years, the postal service has put ban on shipping Li-ion batteries via regular mail. A laser based alternative joining technology has the potential to offer robust, fast and cost-effective processing of Li-Ion batteries. Before the technology can be fully implemented, it is imperative to understand the effects of various process parameters on the robustness of the weld. In the present analysis, a preliminary study is performed to understand the effect of laser scanning speed on the micro-structural and physical characteristics of the materials in the weld area that ultimately affect the bond quality. Samples are created by welding aluminum and copper in lap shear configuration using a continuous wave fiber laser. Two sets of samples are created using a laser power of 225 W; however, the scanning speeds are 300 and 400 mm/s. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy are performed in the weld area to understand the microstructural and physical characteristics of the joint that may have been affected by the processing parameters.},

abstract = {Representative volume element (RVE) is a technique to determine and predict the mechanical and physical effective properties of any random homogeneous or heterogeneous composite material models. An optimal size of RVE model became a major objective in order to be statistically equivalent to the real composite material. In this paper, possible approaches to solving the RVE size problem is by developing a particles dispersion model in implementing microstructure of silver (Ag) micro-particle composite for electrical purpose. In this technique, a micro scale of scanning electronic microscope condition was observed for verification on Ag morphology in an epoxy matrix. The morphological analysis is used to guide the particles dispersion model that can be considered to repeat the whole macro-scale of the composite. In the RVE size study, the various composite model sizes were analyzed on the electrical conductivity for convergence study. The model size was determined by a ratio between width of RVE model and the particle size which given in = W/D. The numbers of RVE size ( ) were set in a size of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The efficiency of size that represents the precision of the estimation of the electrical purpose has been successfully determined by a particle dispersion model developed at model size of = 7. The predicted conductivity at model size of = 7 shows a good agreement with experimental data with the results presented at 5.06 10 1 and 2.69 10 1 S/cm for modeling and experiments, respectively.},

abstract = {The Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) representation has been widely used to approach a number of different high-level computer vision tasks. The idea behind the BoVW representation is similar to the Bag-of-Words (BoW) used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: to extract features from the dataset, then build feature histograms that represent each instance. Although the approach is simple and effective facilitating its applicability to a wide range of problems, it inherits a well-known limitation from the traditional BoW; the disregarding of spatial information among extracted features (sequential information in text), which could be useful to capture discriminative visual-patterns. In this paper, we alleviate this limitation with the joint use of visual words and multi-directional sequences of visual words (visual n-grams). The contribution of this paper is twofold: (i) to build new simple-effective visual features inspired in the popular idea of n-gram representations in NLP and (ii) to propose the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) strategies to better exploit the joint use of visual words and visual n-grams in Image Classification (IC) tasks. For the former, we propose building a codebook of visual n-grams, and use them as attributes to represent images by means of the BoVW representation. For the second point, we consider the visual words and visual n-grams as different feature spaces, then we propose MKL strategies to better integrate the visual information. We evaluate our proposal in the image classification task using five different datasets: Histopathology, Birds, Butterflies, Scenes and a subset of 6 classes of CalTech-101. Experimental results show that the proposed strategies exploiting our visual n-grams, outperforms or is competitive with (i) the traditional BoVW, (ii) the BoVW using visual n-grams under traditional fusion schemes (e.g., ensemble based classifiers) and (iii) other approaches in the literature for IC that consider the spatial context.},

abstract = {To segment the overlapping cells in microscopic images, an automatic method for cell image segmentation based on bottleneck detection and ellipse fitting is proposed. Firstly, cell image is segmented by threshold method, followed by a polygonal approximation to extract the feature points of cell edge. Secondly, candidate splitting point pairs are obtained by calculating the bottleneck rate between each feature point pair, and further judged by ellipse fitting to find the correct splitting point pair. Then, a cell is separated from the overlapping cells according to the splitting point pair, and the remaining edge is patched up to form a new closed contour by an improved ellipse fitting method. Finally, repeat the above steps on the new closed contour until all cells are separated. The performance of this method is evaluated on the blood and fluorescent cell databases. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively segment overlapping cells with high accuracy and less time, which is superior to many existing methods. Splitting point pairs are obtained by bottleneck detection and ellipse fitting.The application of polygonal approximation greatly reduces the computing time.A novel edge modification method is proposed to connect the splitting point pair.Cells can be separated from the overlapping cell contour integrally and completely.Our method outperforms most of the existing algorithms with higher accuracy.},

The reaction was carried out via rapid thermal process (RTP) annealing using two different steps (RTP1 and RTP2) while applying a selective etch (SE) in between them. The intermediate and the end reaction products resulting after RTP1 and RTP2 were found to be dependent on the Ge content, forming Ni-rich silicide (Ni2Si) and NiSi on Si75Ge25, while Ni-rich germanide (Ni5Ge3) and NiGe were obtained by using Si45Ge55. Though the onset of intermediate Ni-rich silicide or germanide phase formation occurs at similar RTP1 temperature (275 C), the reaction completion to yield low resistive phase NiSi or NiGe phase results at different RTP2 temperatures (400 C vs 350 C). Based on the volume expansion, a resistivity value of 25µ cm was obtained for the synthesized NiGe (12nm) and NiSi (14nm) layers. Independent of the phases obtained, the films were found to be closed and homogeneous and exhibit rms roughness of 0.5-0.8nm as evidenced by SEM and AFM analysis.

Their photocatalytic activities were studied through the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in photocatalytic reactor at room temperature under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation and the effect of loading cycles of TiO2 on the structural properties and photocatalytic activity of TiO2/AC composites was also investigated. The results indicate that the anatase TiO2 particles with a crystal size of 10-20 nm can be deposited homogeneously on the AC surface under calcination at 500°C. The loading cycle plays an important role in controlling the loading amount of TiO2 and morphological structure and photocatalytic activity of TiO2/AC composites. The porosity parameters of these composite photocatalysts such as specific surface area and total pore volume decrease whereas the loading amount of TiO2 increases. The TiO2/AC composite synthesized at 2 loading cycles exhibits a high photocatalytic activity in terms of the loading amount of TiO2 and as high as 93.2% removal rate for RhB from the 400 mL solution at initial concentration of 2 \texttimes{} 10-5 mol/L under UV light irradiation.},

TiO2- RGO nanocomposites exhibited great photocatalytic activity toward reduction of CO2 into CH4 (2.10 µmol g-1 h-1) and CH3OH (2.20 µmol g-1 h-1), which is attributed to the synergistic effect between TiO2 and graphene.},

Recombination dynamics of the photo-generated free charge carriers were investigated using micro- to milliseconds transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed the presence of cone structures and bamboo compartments in B-CNTs and N-CNTs, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed very little boron was substituted in the carbon network and presence of pyrrolic, pyridinic, and quaternary species of nitrogen in N-CNTs. J-V characteristics were found to be similar for the devices with B- and N-CNTs even though boron- and nitrogen-doped CNTs are known to have different properties, that is, p-type and n-type, respectively. TAS results showed that all devices had long lived free charge carriers but the devices with B- or N-CNTs had low power conservation efficiency and voltage.},

abstract = {Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a group of prokaryotes that, despite their high morphological, phylogenetic, and ecological diversity, share a common capability of forming intracellular nanocrystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4), called magnetosomes, and swimming along geomagnetic field lines in a process called magnetotaxis. In this study, we investigated the MTB diversity within the intertidal sediments near Xiaoshi Island (Weihai) in the North Yellow Sea using a combination of molecular ecology techniques and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The combination of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed seven new MTB genera affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria class. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses suggested that one magnetotactic coccus (designated as WHI-2) is the dominant species. TEM observations and energy dispersive X-ray analyses revealed that MTB cells mainly form magnetite magnetosomes that are organized into two chains of magnetosomes composed of e-prismatic magnetite crystals. This finding suggests the adaptation of a magnetotactic bacterial population to the marine tide. This is the first report of magnetotactic bacteria near Xiaoshi Island, which should be useful for studies of biogeochemical cycling and the geohistory of this area.},

The structural and optical properties of ZnO nanorods and the behaviour of N dopants have been investigated by means of the scanning electron microscope, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and Raman scattering spectra. The additional vibration modes observed in Raman spectra of N-doped ZnO nanorods provided solid evidence of N incorporation in ZnO nanorods. The difference of excitonic emissions from ZnO nanorods with varied density and surface-to-volume ratio suggested the different spatial distribution of intrinsic defects. It was found that the defects giving rise to acceptor-bound exciton (A0X) emission were most likely to distribute in the sidewall surface with nonpolar characteristics, while the donor bound exciton (D0X) emission related defects distributed uniformly in the near top polar surface.},

N2/77 K adsorption isotherms were investigated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation. HCl vapor removal efficiency was confirmed using two types of detection techniques: a gas detecting tube for low concentrations and gas chromatography for high concentrations. HCl removal efficiency was improved mainly in the copresence of nanostructured Cu/Ni clusters compared to the efficiencies of the as-received and single-metal-plated NCS. In particular, the removal efficiency of Cu/Ni-3 was increased by 270% compared to that of as-received sample, but Cu/Ni-5 showed lower efficiency than Cu/Ni-3, indicating that suitable metal composition on NCS can accelerate HCl removal behaviors of the NCS.},

The H2 gas sensing measurements showed that well-defined WO3 hierarchical porous structures with a large specific surface area exhibited the higher sensitivity compared with products without CTAB at all operating temperatures. Moreover, the reversible and fast response to H2 gas and good selectivity were obtained. The results indicated that the WO3 hierarchical porous structures are promising materials for gas sensors.},

The results shows that it reaches the upmost thickening effect when the theoretical molecular weight is under 20000, soft-segment length is under 4000, solvent ratio is 1 : 1, and thickener percentages are controlled at 10%. Furthermore, thickening mechanism of PU thickener has been analyzed detailedly through the measurement of the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PU thickener and analysis of the influence of PU thickener on the particle size and morphology of PU dispersions. It has been observed from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that the PU aqueous dispersions produce a certain degree of flocculation when the PU thickener was added, and this flocculation structure has been proved to be a thixotropic structure through the characterization of the change of particle size before and after the thickener is introduced into the PU aqueous dispersions. The CMC measurement results present that the thickening effect will be apparent when the concentration is controlled in a low range.},

In this paper, a novel trace and retrace scanning combined (TRSC) topography reconstruction strategy, which successfully utilizes data from both trace and retrace processes, is proposed for AFMs to increase the surface reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, two reconstructed topography images are obtained, one is for trace scanning, and the other is for retrace scanning; the hysteresis distortion is successfully compensated with a data fusion-based postprocessing method; the alignment for trace and retrace images is further guaranteed with a feature point-based strategy; then the two images are combined together with confidence levels to reconstruct the final accurate topography image. Compared with the conventional scanning method, the proposed TRSC imaging algorithm provides much more accurate image for the sample surface, and it is especially valid for high-speed scanning tasks. Some simulation and experimental results are included to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed imaging method.},

abstract = {Schema theory is the most well-known model of evolutionary algorithms. Imitating from genetic algorithms (GA), nearly all schemata defined for genetic programming (GP) refer to a set of points in the search space that share some syntactic characteristics. In GP, syntactically similar individuals do not necessarily have similar semantics. The instances of a syntactic schema do not behave similarly, hence the corresponding schema theory becomes unreliable. Therefore, these theories have been rarely used to improve the performance of GP. The main objective of this study is to propose a schema theory which could be a more realistic model for GP and could be potentially employed for improving GP in practice. To achieve this aim, the concept of semantic schema is introduced. This schema partitions the search space according to semantics of trees, regardless of their syntactic variety. We interpret the semantics of a tree in terms of the mutual information between its output and the target. The semantic schema is characterized by a set of semantic building blocks and their joint probability distribution. After introducing the semantic building blocks, an algorithm for finding them in a given population is presented. An extraction method that looks for the most significant schema of the population is provided. Moreover, an exact microscopic schema theorem is suggested that predicts the expected number of schema samples in the next generation. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed schema definition in representing the semantics of the schema instances. It is also revealed that the semantic schema theorem estimation is more realistic than previously defined schemata.},

abstract = {Due to the substantial complexities of atomic force microscope AFM-based dynamic manipulation models, these models require the identification of many parameters and inputs with varying levels of sensitivity. Various sensitivity analysis SA methods can be used to achieve such a goal. The Sobol method is one of the famous SA approaches based on variance, which is widely used today in various study and scientific fields. The dynamic models for the manipulation of micro/nanoparticles, which have been investigated in previous works by means of the SA methods, have involved spherical nanoparticles with smooth surfaces. Since different micro/nanoparticles have a variety of geometries and since surface roughness plays a significant role in the contact of these particles with different surfaces, in this paper, the sensitivity of the AFM-based dynamic manipulation model of rough micro/nanorods has been analyzed. By considering more diverse geometrical conditions for the target micro/nanoparticle, including a cylindrical geometry and rough surfaces, many geometrical parameters enter the model. Therefore, in this study, simulations have been performed by the Sobol SA approach in order to determine the sensitivity of the input manipulation parameters to the critical output values of manipulation, for the two groups of AFM and environmental parameters. Based on the results obtained from these simulations, cantilever thickness constitutes the most sensitive parameter in the manipulation of rough cylindrical micro/nanoparticles. By analyzing the sensitivities of environmental parameters, it was found that the parameter of surface roughness in the range of 0-0.04 is highly sensitive for rough cylindrical micro/nanoparticles.},

abstract = {The structures and thermoelectric properties of n-type silver-doped Bi2Te3 thin films on SiO2/Si substrates using thermal co-evaporation method were reported. Annealing effects on the thermoelectric properties of thin films were also investigated in the temperature range 100 to 250 C under nitrogen atmosphere. The crystalline structures and morphologies were examined by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscope. The thermoelectric properties of thin films were determined by Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivity measurements. The results showed that as the thin film is annealed at 250 C, the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of -47.04µV/K and 976.13S cm-1 can be obtained, respectively, which resulted in an optimum power factor of about 2.16µW/cm K2. The figure shows the power factors obtained for the Ag doped Bi2Te3 thin films annealed at various temperatures for 30min under N2 atmosphere. The optimum power factor of 4.89µW/cm K2 was obtained in this experiment, which is achieved by the 250 C and 30min annealing.Display Omitted The thermal co-evaporation method was successfully employed for the preparation of the Ag doped Bi2Te3 thermoelectric thin films on SiO2/Si substrates with low cost.The optimized power factor of 2.16µW/cm K2 was obtained for Ag doped Bi2Te3 thin film annealed at 250 C for 30min.},

abstract = {In this work, we have developed a novel multiscale computational contact formulation based on the generalized Derjuguin approximation for continua that are characterized by atomistically enriched constitutive relations in order to study macroscopic interaction between arbitrarily shaped deformable continua. The proposed adhesive contact formulation makes use of the microscopic interaction forces between individual particles in the interacting bodies. In particular, the double-layer volume integral describing the contact interaction (energy, force vector, matrix) is converted into a double-layer surface integral through a mathematically consistent approach that employs the divergence theorem and a special partitioning technique. The proposed contact model is formulated in the nonlinear continuum mechanics framework and implemented using the standard finite element method. With no large penalty constant, the stiffness matrix of the system will in general be well-conditioned, which is of great significance for quasi-static analysis. Three numerical examples are presented to illustrate the capability of the proposed method. Results indicate that with the same mesh configuration, the finite element computation based on the surface integral approach is faster and more accurate than the volume integral based approach. In addition, the proposed approach is energy preserving even in a very long dynamic simulation.},

A confocal microscope provides a sequence of images of the corneal layers and structures at different depths from which medical clinicians can extract clinical information on the state of health of the patient's cornea. A hybrid model based on snake and particle swarm optimisation (S-PSO) is proposed in this paper to analyse the confocal endothelium images.

Three normal corneal data sets acquired using a confocal microscope, and three abnormal confocal endothelium images associated with diseases have been investigated in the proposed system. Promising results are presented and the performance of this system is compared with manual and two morphological based approaches. The average differences between the manual and the automatic cell densities calculated using S-PSO and two other morphological based approaches is 5%, 7% and 13% respectively.

abstract = {Histopathological grading of cancer not only offers an insight to the patients' prognosis but also helps in making individual treatment plans. Mitosis counts in histopathological slides play a crucial role for invasive breast cancer grading using the Nottingham grading system. Pathologists perform this grading by manual examinations of a few thousand images for each patient. Hence, finding the mitotic figures from these images is a tedious job and also prone to observer variability due to variations in the appearances of the mitotic cells. We propose a fast and accurate approach for automatic mitosis detection from histopathological images. We employ area morphological scale space for cell segmentation. The scale space is constructed in a novel manner by restricting the scales with the maximization of relative-entropy between the cells and the background. This results in precise cell segmentation. The segmented cells are classified in mitotic and non-mitotic category using the random forest classifier. Experiments show at least 12% improvement in F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; score on more than 450 histopathological images at 40× magnification.},

In medical ultrasound imaging, the structures that need to be detected appear as a collection of microstructures correlated along a path. In this paper, we investigated techniques that extract meaningful low-level information for curvilinear structures, using techniques based on structure tensor. We proposed a novel structure tensor enhancement inspired by bilateral filtering. We compared the proposed approach with five state-of-the-art curvilinear structure detectors. We tested the algorithms against simulated images with known ground truth and real images from three different domains (medical ultrasound, scanning electron microscope, and astronomy). For the real images, we employed experts to delineate the ground truth for each domain. Techniques borrowed from machine learning robustly assessed the performance of the methods (area under curve and cross validation). As a practical application, we used the proposed method to label a set of 5000 ultrasound images. We conclude that the proposed tensor-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in providing magnitude and orientation information for curvilinear structures. The evaluation methodology ensures that the employed feature-detection method will yield reproducible performance on new, unseen images.

abstract = {We have developed an automated system for the diagnosis of intestinal parasites from optical microscopy images. The objects (species of parasites and impurities) segmented from these images form a large dataset. We are interested in the active learning problem of selecting a reasonably small number of objects to be labeled under an expert's supervision for use in training a pattern classifier. However, impurities are very numerous, constitute several clusters in the feature space, and can be quite similar to some species of parasites, leading to a significant challenge for active learning methods. We propose a technique that pre-organizes the data and then properly balances the selection of samples from all classes and uncertain samples for training. Early data organization avoids reprocessing of the large dataset at each learning iteration, enabling the halting of sample selection after a desired number of samples per iteration, yielding interactive response time. We validate our method by comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches, using a previously labeled dataset of almost 6000 objects. Moreover, we report results from experiments on a very realistic scenario, consisting of a dataset with over 140,000 unlabeled objects, under unbalanced classes, the absence of some classes, and the presence of a very large set of impurities.

To reproduce the tone and important edge structure of input grayscale images, the system adaptively adjusts the density and structure of virtual path, and dynamically controls the size, drawing speed and orientation of parametric circular curve during the synthesis. We demonstrate the potential of our system using several circular scribble images synthesized from a wide variety of grayscale images.

abstract = {The void nucleation and growth (NAG) model describes fracture as a result of nucleation and growth of voids in the ductile materials at the microscopic scales. This model involves five material-dependent parameters, best-fit values of which must be determined by matching with atomistic simulations (MD). This is done by minimizing the difference between the temporal evolution of void volume yielded by MD and by the NAG model. The NAG model represents a real valued, non-linear and non-continuous optimization problem. Therefore, an swarm intelligence based technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for optimum parameters search. The search algorithm is developed on PSO to iteratively search optimum point, starting with a given reference search space and improving it based on the location of best searched point in each iteration. The PSO code is developed using object oriented design patterns so that the same can be extended for other materials without a base change. The paper discusses the code details, best fit parameters for Niobium (Nb) and Molybdenum (Mo) crystals and algorithmic parameters tuning of the modified algorithm. It has been shown that parameter tuning has shown improved results in terms of lower computing cost. It is seen that the MD results match the NAG model with a root mean square error of 7% and 15% for perfect crystal Nb and Mo and 10% and 17% for Nb and Mo crystal with edge dislocation, respectively. Novel features of the work includes the systematic movement of search-space boundaries to aid convergence in an unknown search-space. The sensitivity of the best result to algorithmic parameters and comparative analysis against other PSO variants has also been studied.},

abstract = {Quantum mechanics provides the physical laws governing microscopic systems. A novel and generic framework based on quantum mechanics for image processing is proposed in this paper. The basic idea is to map each image element to a quantum system. This enables the utilization of the quantum mechanics powerful theory in solving image processing problems. The initial states of the image elements are evolved to the final states, controlled by an external force derived from the image features. The final states can be designed to correspond to the class of the element providing solutions to image segmentation, object recognition, and image classification problems. In this work, the formulation of the framework for a single-object segmentation problem is developed. The proposed algorithm based on this framework consists of four major steps. The first step is designing and estimating the operator that controls the evolution process from image features. The states associated with the pixels of the image are initialized in the second step. In the third step, the system is evolved. Finally, a measurement is performed to determine the output. The presented algorithm is tested on noiseless and noisy synthetic images as well as natural images. The average of the obtained results is 98.5 % for sensitivity and 99.7 % for specificity.

abstract = {Complex physical models depending on microstructures developing over time often result in simulation schemes that are very demanding concerning computational time. The two-scale model considered in the current presentation describes a phase transition of a binary mixture with the evolution of equiaxed dendritic microstructures. It consists of a macroscopic heat equation and a family of microscopic cell problems modeling the phase transition. Those phase transitions need to be resolved by very fine computational meshes leading to the demanding numerical complexity. The current study presents a reduced version of this two-scale model. The reduction aims at accelerating the microscopic model, which is parametrized by the macroscopic temperature, while maintaining the accuracy of the detailed system. Parameter dependency, non-linearity, time-dependency, coupled field-variables and high solution complexity are challenging difficulties. They are addressed by a combination of several approaches: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM) and a partitioning approach generating sub-models for different solution regimes. A new partitioning criterion based on feature extraction is applied. The applicability of the reduction scheme is demonstrated experimentally: while the accuracy is largely maintained, the dimensionality of the detailed model and the computation time are reduced significantly.},

abstract = {A surrogate safety measure can be used for preventing hazardous roadway events by evaluating the potential safety risk by using information on the driving environment gathered from vehicles. In this paper, the deceleration-based surrogate safety measure (DSSM) is proposed as a safety indicator for rear-end collision risk evaluation based on the safety conditions and the decision-making process during human driving. The DSSM shows how drivers deal with collision risk differently in acceleration and deceleration phases. The proposed surrogate safety model has been validated for severe deceleration behavior, which is a driver-critical behavior in high-risk situations of collision based on microscopic vehicle trajectory data. The results indicate that there is a strong relationship between the proposed surrogate safety measures and crash potential. The measure could be used for collision warning and collision avoidance systems. It has a merit in that it reflects the characteristics of both vehicle (e.g., mechanical braking capability) and driver (e.g., preference for certain acceleration rates).},

abstract = {The paper deals with computational modeling of aluminium foams on two distinct scales. The microscopically heterogeneous cell walls are modeled with continuum micromechanics models. Several analytical schemes and FFT-based homogenization are applied to predict elastic properties at the first level. Nanoindentation with sharp Berkovich tip is utilized to obtain input parameters for the homogenizations. Plastic properties are assessed directly from spherical nanoindentation at this level.Several geometrical simplifications are studied to model the upper foam level. At first, two dimensional models based on beam analogy and plane strain finite element (FE) models are studied for their ability to predict effective elastic and plastic foam properties. Finally, the behavior of the three dimensional voxel based FE model derived from micro-CT imaging is investigated. Models are compared in terms of their ability to predict experimental results and in terms of their computational demands. It is shown in the paper each model type has difficulties to quantitatively match experimental data in the whole tested range. Two dimensional beam models are capable to predict elastic properties but fail to predict plastic ones. Plane strain FE models are very compliant and lack three dimensional confinement. Three dimensional voxel model has the largest potential to predict experimental measurements but it is the most computationally demanding. It was found the performance of all models on the foam level is very much dependent on their porosity which is the main controlling parameter of the model behavior. Any deviations from experimentally assessed porosity leads to large deviations in the model prediction. Mutual model comparisons and possible solutions are provided in the paper along with computational aspects and requirements.},

X-ray diffraction analysis shows the crystalline nature of the thin films with preferred orientation (0 0 2) plane and hexagonal wurtzite structures. The impact of beam energy on the lattice strain is examined by Williamson-Hall (W-H) plots. The surface morphology examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy analysis show the increased aspect ratio of grains, particle density, and surface coverage with the beam energy. The elemental composition of the films depends on the beam energy. Optical properties characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy indicate high transparency over 75% in the visible region and a sharp UV absorption. The optical band gap, $E_{g}$ obtained from Tauc's plot indicates a decrease in the energy gap with an increase in laser beam energy. Burstein-Moss (B-M) shift is observed in the band gap due to Al-doping. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of the thin films indicate visible emission peaks, corresponding to deep level defects. The electrical properties analyzed by Four probe technique depict that the thin films possess a resistivity ~10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·cm.

This technique has, therefore, become an indispensable tool for measurement at the micro-/nanoscale. However, raster scanning in conventional AFM may induce undesirable mechanical resonance within the scanner and cannot skip the portions outside the actual area of interest within the sample. Furthermore, expanding the range and resolution of traditional AFM images may require excessive scan time. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, in this paper, we design a tapping mode AFM system using a smooth Lissajous scanning trajectory for the desired scan pattern. Based on the path characteristics of the smooth Lissajous trajectory, we develop a scanning algorithm using information related to the height of the sample from which subareas of interest are extracted for the following phase of scanning. Dividing the scanning process in two phases, actually reduces scanning times. To deal with more significant variations in the topography of some parts of the sample, we increase the resolution of scanning in those critical areas. The effectiveness of the proposed scan methodology is demonstrated in a number of conducted experiments.},

To better detect and fuse this data, the authors take a new perspective on feature fusion based on the "collision and reaction"' mechanism of data objects. This mechanism can greatly facilitate differentiating duplicate and nonduplicate data in the fusion (reaction) probability. With this perspective, the fusion probability of a feature sample in a dataset is the cumulative effect of the microscopic collision (interaction) results between this sample and other samples. The operations on duplicate detection and feature fusion depend on the fusion probability and are finally realized when the collision process is finished. This new quantum-inspired feature fusion model gives interesting experimental results and could have great implications for some intelligent systems.},

The CMOS device channel material for sub-10nm dimensions has been identified to be major challenge as per the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). Among the options that are defined by ITRS roadmap is the high mobility III-V based channels. In this paper, we report on new III-V materials showing great potential in achieving nanometric scale transistors in support of applications that require operating at 0.3-0.5V. In the first phase of this research, a special focus was given to Molybdenum/InGaAs contacts in order to set up basic unit processes and characterization techniques. Indeed, the electrical measurement were performed and linked to the interface morphology characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM). Kelvin structures of Molybdenum over InGaAs were fabricated as test structures to measure the contact resistance and resistivity of the aforementioned interface. Plasma damages induced during the fins definition by reactive ion etching are known to significantly increase the contact resistivity in III-V based finFET. The digital etch technique is implemented on an unexposed plasma damages sample in order to assess the compatibility of this technique with a finFET process flow. The first set of electrical measurements gives a contact resistance of 0.71 µm2 competitive with existing Mo/InGaAs contact resistance, revealing the compatibility of the digital etch cleaning technique with common MOSFET process flow.},

abstract = {Numerical continuation calculations for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are, by now, an established tool for bifurcation analysis in dynamical systems theory as well as across almost all natural and engineering sciences. Although several excellent standard software packages are available for ODEs, there are - for good reasons - no standard numerical continuation toolboxes available for partial differential equations (PDEs), which cover a broad range of different classes of PDEs automatically. A natural ach to this problem is to look for efficient gluing computation approaches, with independent components developed by researchers in numerical analysis, dynamical systems, scientific computing and mathematical modeling. In this paper, we shall study several elliptic PDEs (Lane-Emden-Fowler, Lane-Emden-Fowler with microscopic force, Caginalp) via the numerical continuation software pde2path and develop a gluing component to determine a set of starting solutions for the continuation by exploiting the variational structures of the PDEs. In particular, we solve the initialization problem of numerical continuation for PDEs via a minimax algorithm to find multiple unstable solution. Furthermore, for the Caginalp system, we illustrate the efficient gluing link of pde2path to the underlying mesh generation and the FEM MatLab pdetoolbox. Even though the approach works efficiently due to the high-level programming language and without developing any new algorithms, we still obtain interesting bifurcation diagrams and directly applicable conclusions about the three elliptic PDEs we study, in particular with respect to symmetry-breaking. In particular, we show for a modified Lane-Emden-Fowler equation with an asymmetric microscopic force, how a fully connected bifurcation diagram splits up into C-shaped isolas on which localized pattern deformation appears towards two different regimes. We conclude with a section on future software development issues that would be helpful to be addressed to simplify interfaces to allow for more efficient, time-saving, gluing computation for dynamical systems analysis of PDEs in the near future.},

The melting temperature of Sn nanoparticles was measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC822e).

The amphiphilic surface with micro-nano structure turned into an oleophobic and superhydrophobic surface after being chemically modified by low surface energy material.

In this work, an optimized nonparametric learning approach for obtaining the data-guided sampling distribution is proposed, where a probability density function (pdf) is learned in a nonparametric manner based on past measurements from similar types of signals. This learned sampling distribution is then used to better optimize the sampling process based on the underlying signal characteristics. A realization of this stochastic learning approach for compressive sensing of imaging data is introduced via a stochastic Monte Carlo optimization strategy to learn a nonparametric sampling distribution based on visual saliency. Experiments were performed using different types of signals such as fluorescence microscopy images and laser range measurements. Results show that the proposed optimized sampling method which is based on nonparametric stochastic learning outperforms significantly the previously proposed approach. The proposed method is achieves higher reconstruction signal to noise ratios at the same compression rates across all tested types of signals.},

abstract = {Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) is a modern microscopy method for visualization of transport processes in living cells. Although FLIP is widespread, an automated reliable analysis of image data is still lacking. This paper presents a framework for modeling and simulation of FLIP sequences as reaction---diffusion systems on segmented cell images. The cell geometry is extracted from microscopy images using the Chan---Vese active contours algorithm (IEEE Trans Image Process 10(2):266---277, 2001). The PDE model is subsequently solved by the automated Finite Element software package FEniCS (Logg et al. in Automated solution of differential equations by the finite element method. Springer, Heidelberg, 2012). The flexibility of FEniCS allows for spatially resolved reaction diffusion coefficients in two (or more) spatial dimensions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical model for real-time queue estimation using connected vehicle (CV) technology from wireless sensor networks. The objective is to estimate the queue length for queue-based adaptive signal control. The proposed model can be applied without signal timing, traffic volume, or queue characteristics as basic inputs. The model is also developed so that it can work with both fixed-time signals and actuated signals. Furthermore, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to the queue estimation algorithm in this paper for the first time. The purpose of the DWT is to enhance the proposed queue estimation to be more accurate and consistent regardless of the randomness in the penetration ratio. Experimental results are provided to validate the proposed model in both pretimed control and actuated control with a microscopic simulator, i.e., VISSIM. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to estimate the queue length from VISSIM in the test case with pretimed signal control reasonably well. The results in actuated control cases, which have not been studied previously, showed that the proposed algorithm remains as accurate as the pretimed control cases. The accuracy of the proposed queue estimation algorithm is obtained without relying on basic inputs that other models typically require but are often impractical to obtain. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed queue estimation model is applicable for adaptive signal control using CV technology in practice.},

Mastitis is an infectious disease associated with the increased number of somatic cells in cow's milk, and it is one of the most relevant cause of economic losses in dairy farming industries. In this paper, we propose a method capable of determine, with 99.7% accuracy, the number of these cells in microscope slide images. This level of accuracy is achieved by changing the image original RGB format to Lab color space and applying k-means clustering algorithm to remove debris and other background features. A new gray level thresholding is proposed, and the remaining bound cells are separated in the final segmentation step applying Watershed transform. Many microscope slide images with debris, contrast, and hue variation were used to validate the experimental results. Comparison between the proposed method and manual counting indicates that this new approach is a robust and promising solution to be incorporated in a future automated somatic cell counting system using optical microscopy.},

breast lesions, but slice and plane selections result in discrepancies.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the intraobserver reproducibility of
continuous SWE, and whether quantitative elasticities in orthogonal planes
perform better in the differential diagnosis of breast lesions.
METHOD: One hundred and twenty-two breast lesions scheduled for ultrasound-guided
biopsy were recruited. Continuous SWE scans were conducted in orthogonal
planes separately. Quantitative elasticities and histopathology results were
collected. Reproducibility in the same plane and diagnostic performance in
different planes were evaluated.
RESULTS: The maximum and mean elasticities of the hardest portion,
and standard deviation of whole lesion, had high inter-class correlation
coefficients (0.87 to 0.95) and large areas under receiver operation
characteristic curve (0.887 to 0.899). Without loss of accuracy,
sensitivities had increased in orthogonal planes compared with single plane
(from 73.17% up to 82.93% at most). Mean elasticity of whole lesion
and lesion-to-parenchyma ratio were significantly less reproducible and less
accurate.
CONCLUSION: Continuous SWE is highly reproducible for the same
observer. The maximum and mean elasticities of the hardest portion and
standard deviation of whole lesion are most reliable. Furthermore, the
sensitivities of the three parameters are improved in orthogonal planes
without loss of accuracies.},

abstract = {Display Omitted We proposed swinging the diamond knife during IBM.A diamond knife with a tip radius of 5µm was sharpened to 50nm.We saw no facets or ripples on the final surface.Experimental and simulation results are well coincident with each other. Natural single-crystal diamond has unique properties including an ultrahigh strength, ultrahigh hardness, and very low friction coefficient, making it an ideal source material for knives used to make ultrathin and smooth sections for electron microscopy. Facets at the tip and ripple formations on the cutting face are common problems in sharpening diamond knives with small apex angles. In this paper, we propose a method that involves swinging the sample during ion beam sharpening. Diamond knives with an apex angle of 60 (5-µm tip radius) were used as specimens and were machined with 1-keV Ar+ or 0.5-keV O+/O2+ ions using an electron-cyclotron-resonance-type ion beam machining apparatus. We show that the diamond knives can be sharpened in a given swinging angle without the formation of facets or ripples. Swinging the knife through an angle of 30 during processing resulted in a very sharp diamond knife with a tip radius of 50nm and an apex angle of 57 . The machining time with the O+/O2+ beam was about four times faster than that with the Ar+ beam. We also calculated the change in the profile of the diamond knife during the processing. The calculated results coincided with the experimental results, which enables prediction of the knife shape and calculation of the machining time.},

At the top of the cantilever the deposited thin films are partially structured by a ring shaped focused ion beam pattern, leaving behind a cylindrical pillar.

The procedure allowed for a precise measurement of the resistivity of amorphous carbon film by using actual film thickness values instead of data obtained from simulations or theoretical calculations. Large area Ti contacts overlapping the amorphous carbon layer surface were used for current-voltage measurements. An ohmic behavior characterized by a low contact resistance was found.

abstract = {Electronic structure and optical properties of self-assembled quantum dots strongly depend on an intricate interplay of the quantum mechanical size quantization and the atomistic built-in/internal electrostatic fields in the underlying material system. Specifically, built-in fields in zincblende quantum dots originate mainly from: (1) fundamental crystal atomicity and the interfaces between two dissimilar materials, (2) microscopic distribution of strain, and (3) the piezoelectric polarization. In this paper, we first study the origin and nature of these internal fields in InAs/GaAs quantum dots having three different geometries, namely, box, dome, and pyramid. We then quantify and delineate the impact of these internal fields on the one-particle electronic states in terms of symmetry-lowering and localization in the wavefunctions, shift in the energy states and bandgap, anisotropy and non-degeneracy in the $$P$$P level, and formation of mixed excited bound states near the Brillouin zone center. Finally, we study the geometry and size-dependence of interband optical transitions in the XY and XZ planes treating the quantum size quantization and the internal fields as parameters. The computational framework employs a combination of fully atomistic valence force-field molecular mechanics, 20-band nearest-neighbor $$sp^{3} d^{5} s^{*}$$sp3d5s tight-binding electronic bandstructure models, and appropriate post-processing tools to obtain the interband optical transition rates. In particular, to model piezoelectricity, four different polarization models (based on the experimental and ab initio coefficients accounting for both linear and non-linear effects) have been considered in increased order of accuracy. With the non-linear piezoelectricity generally opposing the linear counterpart, the net piezoelectric field is found to be negligible in smaller dots but exhibits non-vanishing effects as the dot height is increased.},

provide evidence that components of garlic have anticancer activity.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, the apoptotic effects of Garlic-derived
compound S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) were investigated in 8305C human
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.

METHODS: The cell line 8305C
(HPACC) were treated with SAMC and the MTT assay, flow cytometry (FCM),
electron microscope method were used to test cell cycle, inhibitory rate and
morphologic changes respectively.

RESULTS: HPACC-8305C cells were
suppressed after exposure to SAMC of 0.02 mg/ml, 0.06 mg/ml, and 0.1 mg/ml
for 48 h. Compared with the control, the difference was significant
(P&lt; 0.05). SAMC could induce apoptosis of the cells in a dose-dependent and
non-linear manner and increase the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase.
Compared with the control, the difference was significant in terms of the
percentage of cells in the G2/M phase (P&lt; 0.05). After exposure to SAMC at
0.02 mg/ml for 24 hours, HPACC-8305C cells showed typical morphologic
change.

CONCLUSIONS: SAMC inhibits the growth of HPACC-8305C cells
by induction of apoptotic cell death and inhibit telomerase activity, which
appears to account for its anti-cancer activity.},

Through silicon via (TSV) technology is a key feature of new 3D integration of circuits by creation of interconnections using vias, which go through the silicon wafer. Typically, the highly-selective Bosch Si etch process is used which is characterized by a high etch rate and high aspect ratio forming a series of scallops on the sidewall. The large scallops may reduce the reliability of the devices, appearing as leakage currents, thermo-mechanical stress or slow device response. The etch profile which is defined by top and bottom dimensions, depth, scallop size (period and amplitude) need to be both monitored and well controlled. Usually using secondary electron microscopy (SEM) cross-section image analysis is destructive, time consuming and depends on the cutting technique. In this work, the nondestructive 3D metrology of deeply-etched structures with an aspect ratio of more than 10 and patterns with lateral dimensions from 3 to 7µm was performed by spectroscopic reflectometry. The TSV depths were determined using the interference effect between waves reflected from TSV's top and bottom surfaces. The scallop size was estimated from the back diffraction effect of light from the side wall. The rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) has been applied for scallop amplitude and top and bottom dimensions evaluation. By the characterization of the scallop size variation, the etch process (etch depth, rate, and reproducibility) can be controlled.},

In particular, we assess the capability of the following five visual features to correctly discriminate epithelium from stroma in digitised tissue micro-arrays of colorectal cancer: coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeliness and roughness. The use of features directly related to human perception makes it possible to evaluate the tissue s appearance on the basis of a set of meaningful parameters; moreover, the number of features used to discriminate epithelium from stroma is very small. In the experiments we used histologically-verified, well-defined images of epithelium and stroma to train three classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Nearest Neighbour rule (1-NN) and Na\"{\i}ve Bayes rule (NB). We optimised SVM s parameters on a validation set, and estimated the accuracy of the three classifiers on a independent test set. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed features can correctly discriminate epithelium from stroma with state-of-the-art accuracy. HighlightsTumour-stroma ratio (TSR) is an independent prognostic factor for a number of oncologic diseases.Manual assessment of TSR is challenging and suffers from poor intra- and interobserver agreement.We propose a computer-assisted approach based on perceptual features for discriminating between epithelium and stroma.The method can correctly differentiate epithelium from stroma with overall accuracy of 97 % .},

abstract = {Display Omitted We studied the TDDB-induced damage mechanism in Cu/ULK structures in-situ.The methodology combined TEM imaging, ESI analysis and in-situ electrical testing.Three major TDDB-induced damage mechanisms were observed.The breakdown spot depends on the materials, geometry and the degradation effects.The results highlight the importance of the quality of the deposition process for the Ta-based barrier. The time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) mechanism in Cu/ultra-low-k (ULK) on-chip interconnect structures has been raising serious reliability concerns for state-of-the-art microelectronic devices in recent years. An advanced experimental methodology, which combines transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and an in-situ electrical test using a Hysitron PI95 TEM holder, was used to study TDDB-induced damage mechanisms and degradation kinetics in Cu/ULK interconnect structures. In flawless Cu/ULK interconnect structures with locally very thin Ta-based barriers, slow but massive Cu migration into the SiO2 layer was observed at the bottom corner of the M1 metal after the TaN/Ta barrier had been firstly ruptured by the Ta migration, driven by the high electrical field. More importantly, it was found that both the high electric field and the massive metal migration into the SiO2 can contribute to the final breakdown of the Cu/ULK interconnect structures. The final breakdown spot could be located either at the interface of the SiCN layer and the ULK material or in the SiO2 layer, which depends on the geometry, the kind of dielectric materials (particularly ULK) and the driving force (the high electric field). The results also highlight the importance of the quality of TaN/Ta barrier deposition process, especially at the bottom corner of the M1 metal, to ensure the functionality of the TaN/Ta barriers during the product lifetimes.},

Today, more and more biological laboratories use 3D cell cultures and tissues grown in vitro as a 3D model of in vivo tumours and metastases. In the last decades, it has been extensively established that multicellular spheroids represent an efficient model to validate effects of drugs and treatments for human care applications. However, a lack of methods for quantitative analysis limits the usage of spheroids as models for routine experiments. Several methods have been proposed in literature to perform high throughput experiments employing spheroids by automatically computing different morphological parameters, such as diameter, volume and sphericity. Nevertheless, these systems are typically grounded on expensive automated technologies, that make the suggested solutions affordable only for a limited subset of laboratories, frequently performing high content screening analysis. In this work we propose AnaSP, an open source software suitable for automatically estimating several morphological parameters of spheroids, by simply analyzing brightfield images acquired with a standard widefield microscope, also not endowed with a motorized stage. The experiments performed proved sensitivity and precision of the segmentation method proposed, and excellent reliability of AnaSP to compute several morphological parameters of spheroids imaged in different conditions. AnaSP is distributed as an open source software tool. Its modular architecture and graphical user interface make it attractive also for researchers who do not work in areas of computer vision and suitable for both high content screenings and occasional spheroid-based experiments.},

In this method, fluorescent nano beads are embedded in the elastic substrate of cell culture, on which cells are cultured. Then, cellular forces are estimated from bead displacements, which represent the force-induced deformation of the substrate under the cell. Estimating the forces from the bead displacements is not easy when the bead density is low or the locations of cellular attachments are unknown. In this study, we propose a Bayesian algorithm by introducing a prior force direction that is based on cellular morphology. We apply the Bayesian framework to synthetic datasets in conditions under which the bead density is low and cellular attachment points are unknown. We demonstrate that the Bayesian algorithm improves accuracy in force estimation compared with the previous algorithms.},

The thermoelectric performance of para-methylbenzenesulfonate (p-MeBzs) doped highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) can be improved by the use of carbon black fillers. Thermoelectric nanocomposites were prepared via chemical polymerization. Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) was introduced before polymerization to act simultaneously as a surfactant for formation of micelles of carbon black and as a doping agent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were employed to characterize the morphology of PEDOT coated carbon black and PEDOT. Electrical conductivity of the composites improved with increase in weight percentage of carbon black from 0% to 30%. Extended chain conformations and increase in electron delocalization reduces the carrier hopping barriers. These contribute to the enhancement of charge carrier mobility. Although electrical conductivity is directly proportional to the increase in the filler content, Seebeck coefficient is more or less constant. Relatively small changes of thermal conductivity can be attributed to the phonon scattering effect in both the carbon black and the thermally insulating PEDOT layers. This study reports that the power factor of the composite was estimated to be 0.993µW/mK2 for 10wt% filler content and was more than 1.7 times higher than that for pure PEDOT, and the maximum figure of merit (ZT) value was 0.0012 at room temperature.},

Unlike earlier methods, ours does not rely on local appearance similarity nor does require a good initial alignment. Furthermore, it can cope with non-linear deformations, topological differences, and partial graphs. To handle arbitrary non-linear deformations, we use Gaussian process regressions to represent the geometrical mapping relating the two graphs. In the absence of appearance information, we iteratively establish correspondences between points, update the mapping accordingly, and use it to estimate where to find the most likely correspondences that will be used in the next step. To make the computation tractable for large graphs, the set of new potential matches considered at each iteration is not selected at random as with many RANSAC-based algorithms. Instead, we introduce a so-called &lt;italic&gt;Active Testing Search&lt;/italic&gt; strategy that performs a priority search to favor the most likely matches and speed-up the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach first on synthetic cases and then on angiography data, retinal fundus images, and microscopy image stacks acquired at very different resolutions.},

abstract = {The main scope of this paper is to investigate the adhesion effect on the mechanical response of MEMS components for RF switch application by using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The occurrence and strength of adhesion effects in MEMS devices depend on a variety of environmental, geometrical and operational parameters. The temperature influence on adhesion is experimentally analyzed considering MEMS materials commonly used to fabricate RF switches. The adhesion force is the main factor with influence on stiction. In fact, stiction is the adhesion occurring between the contact surfaces due to surface forces including van der Waals, capillary forces, Casmir forces, and electrostatic forces. The adhesion between AFM tip and the materials under interest is investigated using the spectroscopy in point mode of an AFM. Different coated AFM tip is considered for tests. The AFM spectroscopy-in-point curve gives the direct measurement of tip-sample interaction force as a function of the gap between the tip and sample. The adhesion between tip and sample is characterized by so-called pull-off or pull-out force. The pull-off force is related in current continuum contact mechanics model to the work of adhesion. Using a thermal controller stage the temperature of investigated materials is changed. The mechanical properties variation of MEMS materials as a function of temperature is monitored and the temperature influence on adhesion is analyzed. The influence of the surface roughness on the adhesion forces between AFM tip and samples is determined. Different roughness (Ra) of investigated polysilicon samples is varied in the range of ~5 to 15 nm. A high value of adhesion force is determined for the contact between gold AFM tip and gold sample comparatively with the contact between Si3N4 AFM tip and gold material. The contact areas between an AFM tip and substrate is an important parameter for analyzing the adhesion effect. The results from laboratory indicate that the adhesive force increases if the surface roughness decreases because the contact area increases. The adhesion between gold microcantilever and substrate obtained from experimental tests (the AFM spectroscopy-in-point mode) results is obtained. During tests, the AFM tip from Si3N4 coated with gold is applied at the beam free-end and deflects the sample to substrate.},

A theoretical model coupling Navier---Stokes equation, convective/diffusion particle transport and deposit formation is developed to simulate a sequence of microfiltration in a confined geometry (Comsol Multyphysics®). This model is used to make predictive simulations of cake growth during the filtration of diluted particles in the range of size of microorganism (5 μm). In the same time a specific filtration micro-system including an optical chamber and a microsieve (Aquamarijn®) filtration membrane is designed in order to perform an experimental approach allowing in situ 3D-visualization of a deposit of model particles (polystyrene fluorescent microspheres) using Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Based on image analysis, the cake building and properties (particle arrangement, thickness) are analyzed. These experimental data will be further used to improve the filtration model in order to obtain a predictive tool for process optimization.},

abstract = {Multi-channel microscopy images have been widely used for drug and target discovery in biomedical studies by investigating morphological changes of individual cells. However, it is still challenging to segment densely touching individual cells in such images accurately and automatically. Herein, we propose a geodesic distance based clustering approach to efficiently segmenting densely touching cells in multi-channel microscopy images. Specifically, an adaptive learning scheme is introduced to iteratively adjust the clustering centers which can significantly improve the segmentation accuracy of cell boundaries. Moreover, a novel seed selection procedure based on nuclei segmentation is suggested to determine the true number of cells in an image. To validate this proposed method, we applied it to segment the touching Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells in multi-channel images for measuring the distinct N-Ras protein expression patterns inside individual cells. The experimental results demonstrated its advantages on accurately segmenting massive touching cells, as well as the robustness to the low signal-to-noise ratio and varying intensity contrasts in multi-channel microscopy images. Moreover, the quantitative comparison showed its superiority over the typical existing cell segmentation methods.},

To address this gap, this study develops and tests a technique to federate two transportation models, each constructed using different simulation software packages: 1 a discrete event-based simulation model of a freight trucking terminal and 2 a discrete time-step-based traffic microscopic simulation model of the network serving the terminal. The federation technique is tested to consider potential feedback loops that may arise between the models during a single simulation run. It is then applied in a notional case study of the Port of Savannah to further assess its capabilities. The findings suggest that this federated simulation technique captures the dynamic interaction of the two systems being modeled. A comparison of the observed versus expected time-based characteristics of the interactions are shown to yield statistically significant correlation.},

In this work a Quasi-Concertina (QC) spring capable of a high linear range, large deflections, high out-of-plane compliance, and low in-plane compliance for MEMS applications is presented. These features are essential for high accuracy out-of-plane measurements such as those required in self-sensing nanoindentation atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes or molecular mass sensors. The spring constant and first mode resonant frequency of the spring was determined analytically and verified numerically. The QC springs were microfabricated using a purposely developed stiction free process. Force-displacement tests on the QC springs have shown them to be in good agreement with the analytical and finite element analysis performed. The measurement results show that the QC springs fabricated have an out-of-plane spring constant of 5.5N/m, 0.129N/m, and 0.156N/m, remain 99% linear to a deflection of 100µm, 1080µm, and 931µm respectively, and can have a total deflection before fracture of as much as 8000µm.},

We report a novel fabrication process for the batch fabrication of insulated conductive scanning probe microscopy (SPM) probes for electrical and topographic characterization of soft samples in liquid media at the nanoscale. The whole SPM probe structure is insulated with a dielectric material except at the very tip end and at the contact pad area to minimize the leakage current in liquid. Additionally, the geometry of the conducting layer in the probe cantilever and substrate is engineered to reduce the parasitic capacitance coupling with the sample. The electrical characterization of the probes has shown that parasitic capacitances are significantly reduced as compared to fully metallized cantilevers.},

abstract = {Due to the importance of cirrhosis evolution, this study examined cirrhotic patients using Self Organizing Mapping (SOM) based on the Child-Pugh scoring method. Because Colored Doppler Ultrasound (CDU) has too many parameters, scoring can be a very difficult task. Classifying cirrhotic patients via SOM and investigating weights of the cirrhotic CDU parameters are aimed in this study. SOM was used to map high dimensional cirrhotic data onto two dimensional clustered data. These clusters provided a feature map of cirrhotic patients. In this study, 103 cirrhotic patients and a control group of 44 healthy individuals were examined in the hospital, and parameters were analyzed using SOM. These data were obtained using CDU, and age and sex parameters were analyzed in this study. Cirrhotic patients were histopathologically separated into subgroups using the Child-Pugh scoring method, and the presence of ascites was determined using SOM. In this study, differences between the control group and cirrhotic patients with their subgroups were investigated using SOM, and the results were discussed. Renal artery indices, hepatic artery indices, portal vein parameters, age and the degree of ascites were analyzed using SOM for a total of 147 individuals. The combination of SOM and Child-Pugh scoring method can be useful for the interpretation of cirrhotic patient's evolution. Computer-based SOM algorithm and negative effectiveness of a large scale dataset could be minimized by adjusting the weight of the parameters. This study will faciliate doctors to make better decisions for their patients.},

CNWs composite hydrogels were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and their morphologies were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The system shows the original extensibility up to about 2500%: the tensile strength and compressive strength have maximum values of 1.338MPa and 2.835MPa, respectively. Besides excellent mechanical properties, CNWs composite hydrogels also have the ability to self-heal and remould: this is mainly attributed to the dissociation and reassociation of the associated micelles. In contrast to conventional cellulose hydrogels, these systems, when broken or cut, can be simply repaired by bringing together fractured surfaces to selfheal at room temperature.},

Biphasic and liquid crystalline dispersions exhibited rheological characteristics similar to those of lyotropic liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). The viscosity versus concentration curve for Ag-EG dispersions showed a viscosity minimum at a silver concentration between 2.2 vol.% and 2.9 vol.%; this is indicative of the transition to an entirely liquid crystalline phase. The rheology results were consistent with optical microscopy observations that at 2.9 vol.% the sample was entirely birefringent; this is another indication of liquid crystalline phase formation. Shear had a significant effect on the microstructure of the dispersions and dried coatings. Depending on the shear rate, worm or shear banding Structures were observed.},

abstract = {Lung surfactant (LS) plays a crucial role in regulating surface tension during normal respiration cycles by decreasing the work associated with lung expansion and therefore decreases the metabolic energy consumed. Monolayer surfactant films composed of a mixture of phospholipids and spreading additives are of optional utility for applications in lung surfactant-based therapies. A simple, minimal model of such a lung surfactant system, composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phosphor-rac-(1-gylcerol)] (DPPG) and hexadecanol (HD), was prepared, and the surface pressure-area (π-A) isotherms and nanostructure characteristics of the binary mixture were investigated at the air/water interface using a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. Based on the regular solution theory, the miscibility and stability of the two components in the monolayer were analyzed in terms of compression modulus (Cs-1), excess Gibbs free energy (Δexcπ), activity coefficients (γ), and interaction parameter (ξ). The results of this paper provide valuable insight into basic thermodynamics and nanostructure of mixed DPPG/HD monolayers; it is helpful to understand the thermodynamic behavior of HD as spreading additive in LS monolayer with a view toward characterizing potential improvements to LS performance brought about by addition of HD to lung phospholipids.},

The phase composition, morphology, and structure of the as-obtained products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Electrochemical properties as supercapacitor electrode materials were systematically investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge tests. It was found that the Co3O4/3D graphene composite showed a maximum specific capacitance of 863 Fg-1, which was obtained by means of CVs at a scan rate of 1 mVs-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Moreover, the composite exhibited improved cycling stability after 1,000 cycles. The good supercapacitor performance is ascribed to the combination of 3D graphene and cauliflower-like Co3O4, which leads to a strong synergistic effect to remarkably boost the utilization ratio of Co3O4 and graphene for high capacitance.},

The 3D nanostructure shows that iron oxide nanoparticles are decorated on graphene with an interconnected network structure. It is found that Fe3O4/GAs own a capacity of As(V) ions adsorption up to 40.048 mg/g due to their remarkable 3D structure and existence of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles for separation. The adsorption isotherm matches well with the Langmuir model and kinetic analysis suggests that the adsorption process is pseudo-second-ordered.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analyses reveal that device performance strongly depends on the P3HT: P3HTPNBI- P3HT thin film morphology. Indeed, the Π-Π stacking nanomorphology rich in the edge-on orientation is formed in the P3HT:P3HT-PNBI-P3HT thin film by optimizing the fabrication conditions, for example, thermal annealing temperature and cast solvent. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.60% is achieved with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.59 V, short-current (Jsc) of 4.43 mA/cm2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.61. These results suggest that P3HT-PNBI-P3HT has the huge potential for the usage as a nonfullerene acceptor material.},

The alloy discs were anodized for 5 min and as a result, NTs of approximately 80 nm diameters were obtained with similar morphology as reported in previous studies using longer anodization times (1-2 h). Filed emissionscanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to characterize the materials surfaces. The NTs showed significantly decreased S. aureus viability after 1, 3, and 5 days of culture in comparison to nonanodized alloy. Likewise, SEM analysis also suggested lower bacterial adhesion on the NTs surface. No differences in bacterial morphology and topography were observed on both materials, as analyzed by SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In conclusion, 80 nm diameter NTs were grown on Ti6Al4V alloy in 5 min by using a SOW solution enriched with fluoride, which resulted in a material with promoted antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus for up to 5 days of in vitro culture when compared to nonanodized alloy.},

abstract = {There are environmental and sustainable benefits of partially replacing cement with industrial by-products or synthetic materials in cement based products. Since microstructural behaviours of cement based products are the crucial parameters that govern their sustainability and durability, this study investigates the microstructural comparison between two different types of cement replacements as nanopozzolan modified cement (NPMC) in cement based product by focusing on the evidence of pozzolanic reactivity in corroboration with physical and mechanical properties. Characterization and morphology techniques using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were carried out to assess the pozzolanic reactivity of cement paste modified with the combination of nano- and micro silica as NPMC in comparison to unmodified cement paste (UCP) of 0.5 water to cement ratio (w/c). Results were then substantiated with compressive strength (CS) results as mechanical property. Results of this study showed clear evidence of pozzolanicity for all samples with varying reactivity with NPMC being the most reactive.},

abstract = {This paper reports the solvothermal synthesis of MoS2 nanoflowers and nanosheets. The nanoflowers have a mean diameter of about 100 nm and were obtained using thioacetamide (C2H5NS) as a sulfur source. The few layered nanosheets were obtained using thiourea (CH4N2S) as a sulfur source. The obtained powders were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The lubricating effect of MoS2 nanoflowers and nanosheets were analyzed using four-ball test, the topography of the wear scar was analyzed using SEM, EDS, and 3D surface profilometry. The relationship between the tribological properties and morphology of the materials was determined. It is observed that the engine oil containing the MoS2 nanomaterials penetrated more easily into the interface space, and it formed a continuous film on the interface surface. The tribological performance showed that the synthesized nanosheets had superior antiwear and friction-reducing properties as a lubrication additive compared with nanoflowers. Also, the wear scar of balls lubricated with nanoflowers revealed a larger diameter compared to nanosheets. In conclusion, nanosheets dispensed in oil have better tribological performance compared to nanoflowers oil in terms of capability to reduce friction.},

The photocatalytic degradation activities of TiO2 loaded HCl and NaCl modified stellerite were better than that of natural stellerite, accompanied with increasing specific surface area. On the contrary, NaOH modification induced the loss of photocatalytic ability of composite due to the generation of silicates.},

We analyzed the structure of solid, rough, and porous nanowire surfaces of boron-doped silicon substrates with resistivities of ρ &gt; 1000 Ωcm, ρ = 14-23 Ωcm, and ρ &lt; 0.01 Ωcm by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen gas adsorption. Silicon nanowires prepared from highly doped silicon reveal mesopores on their surface. However, we found a limit for pore formation. Pores were only formed by etching below a critical H2O2 concentration (cH2O2 &lt; 0.3 M). Furthermore, we determined the pore size distribution dependent on the etching parameters and characterized the morphology of the pores on the nanowire surface. The pores are in the regime of small mesopores with a mean diameter of 9-13 nm. Crystal and surface structure of individual mesoporous nanowires were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The vibrational properties of nanowire ensembles were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Heavily boron-doped silicon nanowires are highly porous and the remaining single crystalline silicon nanoscale mesh leads to a redshift and a strong asymmetric line broadening for Raman scattering by optical phonons at 520 cm-1. This redshift, λSi bulk = 520 cm-1 → λSi nanowire = 512 cm-1, hints to a phonon confinement in mesoporous single crystalline silicon nanowires.},

After this period, the animals were sacrificed and micro-CT analysis, histomorphometric analysis (bone to implant contact (BIC), bone volume (BV)), and removal torque test were performed. Micro-CT analysis, histomorphometric analysis, and removal torque test results all showed the similar pattern, showing that 70 nm experimental group had the highest value at 4 weeks while 30 nm experimental group had the highest value at 12 weeks.

The aspect ratio of the nanorods was higher in the presence of PVP and increased with increasing concentrations of PVP. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the HA nanorods were of the hexagonal apatite phase. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed that the nanorods grew in the c-axis direction (preferred orientation). The calculated lattice spacing was ∼0.35 nm which is the c-axis value of hexagonal HA. Morphological variations of pristine and PVP added HA were evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and TEM, which revealed that the presence of PVP greatly increased the aspect ratio of the HA nanorods. The formation mechanism of the PVP assisted HA was studied and a possible reaction model was given. Cell viability analysis by in vitro studies showed encouraging results for the high aspect ratio nanorods and indicated a possibility for tuning the activity based on controlling the aspect ratio.},

The customized implants (threaded and nonthreaded type), surface-treated with different diameter of TiO2 nanotubes (30 nm, 50 nm, 70 nm, and 100nm nanotube), were placed on both sides of the femur of 50 male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old). Rats were sacrificed at 2 and 6 weeks following surgery; then the specimens were collected by perfusion fixation and the osseointegration of implants was evaluated by radiographic and histologic analyses and removal torque value test. The mean of bone area (%) and the mean of removal torque were different in each group, indicating that the difference in TiO2 nanotube size may influence new bone formation and osseointegration in rats.},

In this paper we report effect of doping with some rare earth (RE) elements (Pr, Sm, and Tb) on the morphology and crystallite size of Co3O4 nanorods. The various precursors (RE/Co oxalates) were prepared via the microwave assisted method and subsequent calcination. The decomposition pathway of these precursors was followed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Based on thermal analysis results, Pr-, Sm-, and Tb-doped Co3O4 samples were obtained via the calcination in static air at 500°C for their oxalate precursors. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) were used to characterize the RE-doped cobalt oxide catalysts. The activity of the prepared catalysts was investigated for N2O direct decomposition and compared with that of the undoped Co3O4 catalyst. It was shown that the promoted Co3O4 catalysts revealed higher activity compared to the unpromoted one. The dependence of the activity on both the catalysts particle size and the reduction behaviour was discussed.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) photooxidation has recently been developed to fabricate superhydrophobic polyimide (PI) films in combination with fluoroalkylsilane modification. However, it remains unclear whether the surface morphology and hydrophobicity are sensitive to technical parameters such as UV intensity and radiation environment. Herein, we focus on the effects of UV intensity on PI surface structure and wettability to gain comprehensive understanding and more effective control of this technology. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results showed that UV intensity governed the evolutionary pattern of surface morphology: lower UV intensity (5mW/cm2) facilitated in-plane expansion of dendritic protrusions while stronger UV (10 and 15mW/cm2) encouraged localized growth of protrusions in a piling-up manner. Surface roughness and hydrophobicity maximized at the intensity of 10mW/cm2, as a consequence of the slowed horizontal expansion and preferred vertical growth of the protrusions when UV intensity increased. Based on these results, the mechanism that surface micro/nanostructures developed in distinct ways when exposed to different UV intensities was proposed. Though superhydrophobicity (water contact angle larger than 150°) can be achieved at UV intensity not less than 10mW/cm2, higher intensity decreased the effectiveness. Therefore, the UV photooxidation under 10mW/cm2 for 72 h is recommended to fabricate superhydrophobic PI films.},

The toxicity of these four kinds of nanoparticles was studied through darkroom experiments. And based on the concentration which caused the same toxic effect (90%) on HL60, PDT experiments of TiO2, Fe/TiO2 (2%), Fe/TiO2 (5%), and ALA/TiO2 were done, resulting in the fact that the photokilling efficiency was 69.7%, 71.6%, 72%, and 80.6%, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the samples were also taken to study the morphology of HL60 cells before and after PDT, resulting in the fact the activation of the modified TiO2 from PDT was the main cause of cell apoptosis.},

The size of the nanoparticles is determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and it is observed that the size of the nanoparticles ranges from 7 to 30 nm. The TEM images and optical absorption spectra of the Au NPs reveal that the suspension is well dispersed and consistent with the particle size. The feasibility of the seeding growth technique is investigated using Turbiscan Classic MA 2000 screening stability tester. Based on the peak thickness kinetics and mean value kinetics, the backscattered light profiles indicate that the suspension is highly stable without particle sedimentation as well as negligible agglomeration. In addition, the Au NPs are proven to remain stable over a period of 2 months. Particle sedimentation eventually occurs due to the weight of nanoparticles. It is concluded that the seeding growth technique is feasible in synthesizing stable Au NPs. Controlling the stability, size and shape of Au NPs are technologically important because of the strong correlation between these parameters and the optical, electrical, and catalytic properties of the nanoparticles.},

The results show that N type doping has no notable effects on the morphology and structure of TiO2 nanotube arrays. After N type doping, the N replaces a small amount of O in TiO2, forming an N-Ti-O structure. This shifts the optical absorption edge and enhances absorption of the visible light. N-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays subjected to annealing at 500°C in N2 atmosphere show the strongest photocatalytic activity and reach a degradation rate of 84% within 2 h.},

abstract = {Tb3+ -doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Tb3+) nanocrystals were synthesized by spray precipitation with sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) culture at room temperature. The morphology of the SRB and ZnS:Tb3+ nanocrystals was examined by scanning electron microscopy, and the ZnS:Tb3+ nanocrystals were characterized by X-ray diffractometry and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The PL mechanism of ZnS:Tb3+ nanocrystals was further analyzed, and the effects of Tb3+ ion concentration on the luminescence properties of ZnS:Tb3+ nanocrystals were studied. ZnS:Tb3+ nanocrystals showed a sphalerite phase, and the prepared ZnS:Tb3+ nanocrystals had high luminescence intensity under excitation at 369 nm. The main peak position of the absorption spectra positively blueshifted with increasing concentrations of Tb3+ dopant. Based on the strength of the peak of the excitation and emission spectra, we inferred that the optimum concentration of the Tb3+ dopant is 5 mol%. Four main emission peaks were obtained under excitation at 369 nm:489 nm(5D4 → 7F6), 545 nm(5D4 → 7F5), 594 nm(5D4 → 7F4), and 625nm (5D4 → 7F3). Our findings suggest that nanocrystals have potential applications in photoelectronic devices and biomarkers.},

abstract = {The combination of two components with uniform distribution in nanoscale is expected to facilitate wider applications of the material. In this study, polyaniline (PAn) and polyaniline/montmorillonite (Mt) nanocomposite were prepared by solid reaction using persulfate of ammonium as oxidant. The phase composition and morphology of the nanocomposite were characterized by FTIR, UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometer, thermal gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The electrical and dielectric properties were determined using spectroscopy impedance. The analysis of UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopy demonstrated that aniline chloride has been polymerized into PAn in its conducting emeraldine form. Thermogravimetric analysis suggested that PAn chains intercalated in the clay host are more thermally stable than those of free PAn prepared by solid-solid reaction. Electrical measurements were carried out using the complex impedance technique in the frequency range of 10-2 to 104 Hz at different temperatures. The ac conductivity data of different nanocomposites were analyzed as a function of frequency and temperature. It has been found that the incorporation of inorganic clay phase into polyaniline matrix has an effect on the electrical and dielectric properties of the nanomaterial.},

According to Gd2Ti2O7 precursor gel thermal analysis a temperature of 840°C is identified for the formation of the crystalline pyrochlore phase. Obtained samples were systematically characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The powders consist of well-crystalline cubic nanocrystallites of approximately 20 nm in size as evidenced from X-ray diffraction. The scanning and transmission electron microscopy shows that investigated Eu3+-doped Gd2Ti2O7 nanopowders consist of compact, dense aggregates composed entirely of nanoparticles with variable both shape and dimension. The influence of Eu3+ ions concentration on the optical properties, namely, photoluminescence emission and decay time, is measured and discussed. Emission intensity as a function of Eu3+ ions concentration shows that Gd2Ti2O7 host can accept Eu3+ ions in concentrations up to 10 at.%. On the other hand, lifetime values are similar up to 3 at.% (∼2.7 ms) and experience decrease at higher concentrations (2.4 ms for 10 at.% Eu3+). Moreover, photoluminescent spectra and lifetime values clearly revealed presence of structural defects in sol-gel derived materials proposing photoluminescent spectroscopy as a sensitive tool for monitoring structural changes in both steady state and lifetime domains.},

Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterize the particles. The Scherrer formula was applied to estimate the particle size using the width of the diffraction peaks. The obtained results indicate that the synthesized material is mainly composed of nanocrystalline barite, with nearly spherical morphology, and diameters ranging from 4 to 92nm. The lattice images of nanoparticles were clearly observed by HRTEM, indicating a high degree of crystallinity and phase purity. In addition, agglomerates with diameters between 20 and 300 nm were observed in both lattice images and dynamic light scattering measurements. The latter allowed obtaining the particle size distribution, the evolution of the aggregate size in time of BaSO4 in aqueous solutions, and the sedimentation rate of these solutions from turbidimetry measurements. A short discussion on the possible medical applications is presented.},

The obtained products were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Effects of initial dye concentration and contact time on adsorption capacity of TiO2@yeast-carbon for cationic dye methylene blue (MB) and anionic dye congo red (CR) were investigated. Experimental data were described by Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Koble-Corrigan isotherm models, respectively. It was found that the equilibrium data of MB adsorption were best represented by Koble-Corrigan, and CR adsorption was best described by both Freundlich and Koble-Corrigan isotherm models. The kinetic data of MB and CR adsorption fitted pseudo-second-order kinetic model well. The results demonstrated that TiO2@yeast-carbon microspheres achieved favorable removal for the cationic MB in comparison with that for the anionic CR. In addition, regeneration experimental results showed that TiO2@yeast-carbon exhibited good recycling stability, reusability, and in situ renewability, suggesting that the as-prepared TiO2@yeast-carbon might be used as the potential low cost alternative for recalcitrant dye removal from industrial wastewater. One possible mechanism for regenerating dye-loaded TiO2@yeast in situ was also proposed.},

The surface morphologies of DLC-Cu thin films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Three-dimensional brain models were reconstructed using magnetic resonance imaging to simulate the electrosurgical operation. In adult rats, a monopolar electrosurgical instrument coated with the DLC-Cu thin film was used to generate lesions in the brain. Animals were sacrificed for evaluations on postoperative days 0, 2, 7, and 28. Data indicated that the temperature decreased significantly when minimally invasive electrosurgical instruments with nanostructure DLC-Cu thin films were used and continued to decrease with increasing film thickness. On the other hand, the DLC-Cu-treated device created a relatively small thermal injury area and lateral thermal effect in the brain tissues. These results indicated that the DLC-Cu thin film minimized excessive thermal injury and uniformly distributed the temperature in the brain. Taken together, our study results suggest that the DLC-Cu film on copper electrode substrates is an effective means for improving the performance of electrosurgical instruments.},

Enhancing iron core magnetic properties and, in parallel, improving carbon shell sealing are the two major challenges in the synthesis of CEINPs. Here, we present the synthesis of both CEINPs and a new carbon encapsulated multi-iron nanoparticle by a new modified arc discharge reactor. The nanoparticle size, composition, and crystallinity and the magnetic properties have been studied. The morphological properties were observed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In order to evaluate carbon shell protection, the iron cores were characterized by selected area diffraction and fast Fourier transform techniques as well as by electron energy loss and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies. Afterward, the magnetic properties were investigated using a superconducting quantum interference device. As main results, spherical, oval, and multi-iron cores were controllably synthesized by this new modified arc discharge method. The carbon shell with high crystallinity exhibited sufficient protection against oxidation of pure iron cores. The presented results also provided new elements for understanding the growth mechanism of iron core and carbon shell.},

The obtained results revealed that (a) MXene could greatly improve the early compressive strength of cement paste with 0.04wt% concentration, (b) the phase type of early-age hydration products has not been changed after the addition of MXene, (c) hydration exothermic rate within 72 h has small difference at different amount of MXene, and (d) morphologies of hydration products were varied with the dosage of MXene, a lot of tufted ettringites appeared in 3 d hydration products when the content of MXene was 0.04wt%, which will have a positive effect on improving the early mechanical properties of cement paste. MXene has inhibited the Portland cement hydration process; the main role of MXene in the cement hydration process is to promote the messy ettringite becoming regular distribution at a node and form network connection structure in the crystals growth process, making the mechanics performance of cement paste significantly improved.},

The microstructure, composition, and photoluminescence property were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence spectra. The results showed that single crystalline GaN nanowires with the diameter of about 90 nm and the length up to tens of micrometers had been grown thickly across Si (100) substrates with uniform density. Moreover, the variations of the GaN nanowire morphology, density, and size were largely attributed to substrate positions which would influence Ga precursor density in the carrier gas, the saturation degree of gaseous reactants, and the catalyst activity, respectively, in the fabrication of GaN nanowires by the vapour liquid solid mechanism.},

abstract = {This paper used graphite nanoparticles with the diameter of 35 and 80 nm and LB2000 vegetable based oil to prepare graphite oil-based nanofluids with different volume fractions by two-step method. The tribological properties of graphite nanoparticles as LB2000 vegetable based oil additive were investigated with a pin-on-disk friction and wear tester. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to examine the morphology and the content of some typical elements of wear scar, respectively. Further, the lubrication mechanism of graphite nanoparticles was explored. It was found that graphite nanoparticles as vegetable based oil additive could remarkably improve friction-reducing and antiwear properties of pure oil. With the increase of volume fraction of graphite nanoparticles, the friction coefficient and the wear volume of disk decreased. At the same volume fraction, the smaller particles, the lower friction coefficient and wear volume. The main reason for the improvement in friction-reducing and antiwear properties of vegetable based oil using graphite nanoparticles was that graphite nanoparticles could form a physical deposition film on the friction surfaces.},

The influence of the pH value on gold nanoparticle size in the presence of PDEAEM was investigated. Results show that the pH of the reacting mixture has a dramatic effect on the size, polydispersity, and morphology of the resulting AuNPs. Moreover, the size of the nanoparticles (NPs) may be modified by changing the solution's pHor by changing the solvent type. Electron microscope images showed that the sizes of AuNPs coated with PDEAEM were not sensitive to the variation of the polymer molecular weight in the range between 9000 and 29300 g/mol; however their aggregation behavior depended strongly on the polymer molecular weight as revealed by dynamic light scattering studies. AuNPs stabilized with PDEAEM (AuNP@PDEAEM) are stable in water at acidic pH and in organic polar solvents.},

It is shown that superhydrophobicity and water repellency were achieved on the surface of the deposited films, when high particle concentrations were used (≥1% w/v), corresponding to high static (θs ≈ 162°) and low tilt (θt &lt; 3°) contact angles. To interpret these results, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to observe the surface morphologies of the siloxane-nanoparticle films. Static contact angles, measured on surfaces that were prepared from dilute dispersions (particle concentration &lt;1% w/v), increased with particle concentration and attained a maximum value (162°) which corresponds to superhydrophobicity. Increasing further the particle concentration did not have any effect on θs. Colourimetric measurements showed that the superhydrophobic films had negligible effects on the aesthetic appearance of the treated papers. Furthermore, it is shown that the superhydrophobic character of the siloxane-nanoparticle films was stable over a wide range of pH.},

Here, we report our studies to couple S with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) prepared via either mechanical milling or chemical precipitation. The differences of the resulting rGO/S composites with respect to morphology, structure, composition, and phase transformations are extensively studied. Thermal analyses, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopic results on the chemical rGO/S consistently confirmed the existence of amorphous/nanocrystalline S and their homogeneous distribution as well as interaction with the rGO microstructure. The electrochemical performances of chemical rGO/S revealed a marked improvement in both capacity retention and S utilization compared to those of the mechanical rGO/S.},

Surface area increased as the milling time extended. After 5 h ball milling, TiO2 hierarchical nanotubes exhibited a corn-like shape and exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical activity in comparison to commercial P25. The superior photocatalytic activity is suggested to be due to the combined advantages of high surface area of nanoparticles and rapid electron transfer as well as collection of the nanotubes in the hierarchical structure. The hierarchical structured TiO2 nanotubes could be applied into flexible applications on solar cells, sensors, and other photoelectrochemical devices.},

After the hydrothermal processing, the layered titanate was washed with acid and water in order to control the amount of Na+ ions remaining in the sample solutions. In this study, the effect of different reaction durations in a range of 3 h to 24 h on the formation of nanotubes was carried out. As the reaction duration is extended, the changes in structure from particle to tubular shapes of alkaline treated TiO2 were obtained via scanning electron microscope (SEM). Also, the significant impact on the phase transformation and crystal structure of TNT was characterized through XRD and Raman analysis. Indeed, the photocatalytic activity of TNT was investigated through the degradation of methyl orange aqueous solution under the ultraviolet light irradiation. As a result, TNT with reaction duration at 6 h has a better photocatalytic performance than other samples which was correlated to the higher crystallinity of the samples as shown in XRD patterns.},

Additionally, the effect of maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (PEgMA) and methyl acrylate grafted polyethylene (EMA) compatibilizers, on the tensile properties, was also studied. Morphological characterization of nanocomposites was carried out by means of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Flame retardant properties of nanocomposites were evaluated by the UL-94 horizontal and vertical tests as well as by cone calorimeter tests. Thermal degradation behavior was analyzed with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Tensile tests were carried out according to ASTM D 638-03 in an Instron 4301 tensile testing machine. From STEM images, a good dispersion of flame retardants (MH and ATH) in the polymer matrix was observed, which was reflected in the flame retardant properties. Results showed that the combination of nanometric MH and ATH produced excellent flame retardant properties, achieving a classification of V0 in the UL-94-V test and producing the lowest peak of heat release rate (PHRR) and the lowest total heat released (THR) in the cone calorimeter test. Finally, the addition of compatibilizer, especially PEgMA, resulted in much better tensile properties as compared to the noncompatibilized composition, maintaining the flame retardant properties.},

abstract = {Flower-like bundles of ZnO nanosheets have been prepared by using preheating hydrothermal process without any surfactants. The flower-like bundles consist of many thin and uniform hexagonal-structured ZnO nanosheets, with a thickness of 50 nm. The selected area electronic diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images indicate that the ZnO nanosheets are single crystal in nature. The growth mechanism of the flower-like bundles of ZnO nanosheets is discussed based on the morphology evolution with growth times and reaction conditions. It is believed that the formation of flowerlike bundles of ZnO nanosheets is related to the shielding effect of OH- ions and the self-assembly process, which is dominated by a preheating time. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra results show that the annealing atmosphere strongly affects the visible emission band, which is sensitive to intrinsic and surface defects, especially oxygen interstitials, in flower-like bundles of ZnO nanosheets.},

The main current researches are related to the oxide metallic NPs. In the present work, fifty-six bacterial strains were isolated from soil, comprising 17 different OTUs distributed into 3 classes: Bacilli (36 strains), Flavobacteria (2 strains), and Gammaproteobacteria (18 strains). Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) were synthesized using a process of chemical precipitation. The obtained CuONPs have a spherical shape and primary size less than 17 nm. Twenty-one strains were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of CuONPs and 11 of these strains showed high sensibility. Among those 11 strains, 4 (Brevibacillus laterosporus strain CSS8, Chryseobacterium indoltheticum strain CSA28, and Pantoea ananatis strains CSA34 and CSA35) were selected to determine the kind of damage produced. The CuONPs toxic effect was observed at expositions over 25mgundefinedL-1 and the damage to cell membrane above 160mgundefinedL-1. The electron microscopy showed the formation of cavities, holes, membrane degradation, blebs, cellular collapse, and lysis. These toxic effects may probably be due to the ions interaction, the oxide-reduction reactions, and the generation of reactive species.},

abstract = {Effective Poisson--Nernst--Planck (PNP) equations are derived for  ion transport in charged porous media under
forced convection (periodic flow in the frame of the mean velocity) by an asymptotic multiscale expansion with drift.  The homogenized equations provide a modeling framework for engineering  while also addressing fundamental questions about electrodiffusion in charged porous media, relating to electroneutrality, tortuosity, ambipolar diffusion, Einstein's relation, and hydrodynamic dispersion.
The microscopic setting is a two-component periodic composite consisting of a dilute electrolyte continuum (described by standard PNP equations) and a continuous dielectric matrix, which is impermeable to the ions and carries a given surface charge.  As a first approximation for forced convection, the electrostatic body force on the fluid and electro-osmotic flows are neglected.
Four new features arise in the upscaled equations: (i) the effective ionic diffusivities and mobilities become tensors, related to the microstructure; (ii) the effective permittivity is also a  tensor, depending on the electrolyte/matrix permittivity ratio and the ratio of the Debye screening length to the macroscopic length of the porous medium; (iii) the microscopic convection leads to
a diffusion-dispersion correction in the effective diffusion tensor; and (iv)  the surface charge per volume appears as a continuous “background charge density,” as in classical membrane models.  The coefficient tensors in the upscaled PNP equations can be calculated from periodic reference cell problems. For an insulating solid matrix, all gradients are corrected by the same tensor, and the Einstein relation holds at the macroscopic scale, which is not generally the case for a polarizable matrix, unless the permittivity and electric field are suitably defined.  In the limit of thin double layers, Poisson's equation is replaced by macroscopic electroneutrality (balancing ionic and surface charges). The general form of the macroscopic PNP equations may also hold for concentrated solution theories, based on the local-density and mean-field approximations. These results have broad applicability to ion transport in porous electrodes, separators, membranes, ion-exchange resins, soils, porous rocks, and biological tissues.},

abstract = {This work was motivated by the need for perceptualizing nano-scale scientific data, e.g., those acquired by a scanning probe microscope, where collocated topography and stiffness distribution of a surface can be measured. Previous research showed that when the topography of a surface with spatially varying stiffness is rendered using the conventional penalty-based haptic rendering method, the topography perceived by the user could be significantly distorted from its original model. In the worst case, a higher region with a smaller stiffness value can be perceived to be lower than a lower region with a larger stiffness value. This problem was explained by the theory of force constancy: the user tends to maintain an invariant contact force when s/he strokes the surface to perceive its topography. In this paper, we present a haptization algorithm that can render the shape of a mesh surface and its stiffness distribution with high perceptual accuracy. Our algorithm adaptively changes the surface topography on the basis of the force constancy theory to deliver adequate shape information to the user while preserving the stiffness perception. We also evaluated the performance of the proposed haptization algorithm in comparison to the constraint-based algorithm by examining relevant proximal stimuli and carrying out a user experiment. Results demonstrated that our algorithm could improve the perceptual accuracy of shape and reduce the exploration time, thereby leading to more accurate and efficient haptization.},

The causes for the formation of nanotubes have been discussed according to the experimental results. Nanopores are formed firstly at the early stage of anodization, O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; ion needed to oxidize the titanium metal below the pore wall must diffuse inward from both sides of the pore wall. Because of the different diffusion resistances, O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations are different at different positions of the interface between titanium metal and pore wall, leading to different oxide compositions. As a result, the surface of pore wall is mainly composed of high valence oxide TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while the middle of pore wall is mainly composed of suboxides, such as Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and TiO. The pore wall would crack easily at the middle low strength suboxides due to temperature changes during anodization, which results in the conversion of nanopores into nanotubes. The selective dissolution of suboxides in the electrolyte leads to the formation of gaps between nanotubes.},

Specifically, considering the features of the piezoscanner in the AFM system, a segmented swept signal with decreasing amplitudes is adopted as the input exerted on the piezoscanner, with the collected data utilized to setup a dynamic model based on the numerical algorithm for subspace state-space system identification (N4SID) algorithm, where the varying gain is successfully acquired by a polynomial fitting method to increase model precision. Based on the predicted dynamic behavior of the varying-gain model, an advanced DMPC algorithm is designed to fasten the system response and to enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system.

abstract = {In semiconductor manufacturing, wafer quality control strongly relies on product monitoring and physical metrology. However, the involved metrology operations, generally performed by means of scanning electron microscopes, are particularly cost-intensive and time-consuming. For this reason, in common practice a small subset only of a productive lot is measured at the metrology stations and it is devoted to represent the entire lot. Virtual Metrology (VM) methodologies are used to obtain reliable predictions of metrology results at process time, without actually performing physical measurements. This goal is usually achieved by means of statistical models and by linking process data and context information to target measurements. Since semiconductor manufacturing processes involve a high number of sequential operations, it is reasonable to assume that the quality features of a given wafer (such as layer thickness and critical dimensions) depend on the whole processing and not on the last step before measurement only. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities to enhance VM prediction accuracy by exploiting the knowledge collected in the previous process steps. We present two different schemes of multi-step VM, along with dataset preparation indications. Special emphasis is placed on regression techniques capable of handling high-dimensional input spaces. The proposed multi-step approaches are tested on industrial production data.},

abstract = {Q&amp;A social media have gained a lot of attention during the recent years. People rely on these sites to obtain information due to a number of advantages they offer as compared to conventional sources of knowledge (e.g., asynchronous and convenient access). However, for the same question one may find highly contradicting answers, causing an ambiguity with respect to the correct information. This can be attributed to the presence of unreliable and/or non-expert users. These two attributes (reliability and expertise) significantly affect the quality of the answer/information provided. We present a novel approach for estimating these user's characteristics relying on human cognitive traits. In brief, we propose each user to monitor the activity of his peers (on the basis of responses to questions asked by him) and observe their compliance with predefined cognitive models. These observations lead to local assessments that can be further fused to obtain a reliability and expertise consensus for every other user in the social network (SN). For the aggregation part we use subjective logic. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of this kind in the context of Q&amp;A SNs. Our proposed approach is highly distributed; each user can individually estimate the expertise and the reliability of his peers using his direct interactions with them and our framework. The online SN (OSN), which can be considered as a distributed database, performs continuous data aggregation for users expertise and reliability assesment in order to reach a consensus. In our evaluations, we first emulate a Q&amp;A SN to examine various performance aspects of our algorithm (e.g., convergence time, responsiveness etc.). Our evaluations indicate that it can accurately assess the reliability and the expertise of a user with a small number of samples and can successfully react to the latter's behavior change, provided that the cognitive traits hold in practice. Furthermore, the use of the consensus operator for the aggregation of multiple opinions on a specific user, reduces the uncertainty with regards to the final assessment. However, as real data obtained from Yahoo! Answers imply, the pairwise interactions between specific users are limited. Hence, we consider the aggregate set of questions as posted from the system itself and we assess the expertise and realibility of users based on their response behavior. We observe, that users have different behaviors depending on the level at which we are observing them. In particular, while their activity is focused on a few general categories, yielding them reliable, their microscopic (within general category) activity is highly scattered.},

abstract = {This paper presents a shape sensitivity analysis and what-if study for two-dimensional multi-scale crack propagation problems using bridging scale decomposition. The sensitivity equations are derived in a continuum setting using direct differentiation method based on a continuum variational formulation of the bridging scale. Due to the fact that the crack propagation speed in an atomistic simulation is discrete in design, and cannot be formulated as a continuous function of shape design variables, we propose a hybrid method that combines analytical sensitivity analysis with finite difference approach. The finite difference part of the sensitivity analysis is only intended for calculating the sensitivity of crack growth speed based on the analytically obtained sensitivity coefficients of structural responses. The theoretical development on sensitivity formulation in this paper extends the application of the method to irregular-shaped finite elements and general design velocity fields. Furthermore, we evaluate and compare several performance measures that quantify crack propagation speed based on crack tip locations for sensitivity analysis and ultimately for structural optimization. A two-dimensional beam example is used to verify the accuracy of the proposed sensitivity approach. It is also demonstrated through a what-if study that with an adequate performance measure, the impact of macroscopic shape changes on microscopic crack propagation speed can be accurately predicted.},

the foundation for optical flow methods and has been generalized to said
scenario, we formulate the principle of mass conservation for time-varying
surfaces that are embedded in Euclidean 3-space and derive a generalized
continuity equation. The main motivation for this work is efficient cell motion
estimation in volumetric fluorescence microscopy images of a living zebrafish
embryo. The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of modern microscopes
requires efficient analysis of such data. With this application in mind we
address this need and follow an emerging paradigm in this field: dimensional
reduction. In light of the ill-posedness of considered conservation laws, we
employ Tikhonov regularization and propose the use of spatially varying
regularization functionals that recover motion only in regions with cells. For
the efficient numerical solution, we devise a mesh-free Galerkin method based on
compactly supported (tangent) vectorial basis functions. Furthermore, for the
fast and accurate estimation of the evolving sphere-like surface from scattered
