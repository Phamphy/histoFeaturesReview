abstract = {This work presents a quantitative microscopic approach for discriminating oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) from normal oral mucosa (NOM) in respect to morphological and textural properties of the basal cell nuclei. Practically, basal cells constitute the proliferative compartment (called basal layer) of the epithelium. In the context of histopathological evaluation, the morphometry and texture of basal nuclei are assumed to vary during malignant transformation according to onco-pathologists. In order to automate the pathological understanding, the basal layer is initially extracted from histopathological images of NOM (n=341) and OSF (n=429) samples using fuzzy divergence, morphological operations and parabola fitting followed by median filter-based noise reduction. Next, the nuclei are segmented from the layer using color deconvolution, marker-controlled watershed transform and gradient vector flow (GVF) active contour method. Eighteen morphological, 4 gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features and 1 intensity feature are quantized from five types of basal nuclei characteristics. Afterwards, unsupervised feature selection method is used to evaluate significant features and hence 18 are obtained as most discriminative out of 23. Finally, supervised and unsupervised classifiers are trained and tested with 18 features for the classification between normal and OSF samples. Experimental results are obtained and compared. It is observed that linear kernel based support vector machine (SVM) leads to 99.66% accuracy in comparison with Bayesian classifier (96.56%) and Gaussian mixture model (90.37%).},

abstract = {Gleason patterns of prostate cancer histopathology, characterized primarily by morphological and architectural attributes of histological structures (glands and nuclei), have been found to be highly correlated with disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. Gleason patterns 4 and 5 are highly correlated with more aggressive disease and poorer patient outcome, while Gleason patterns 1-3 tend to reflect more favorable patient outcome. Because Gleason grading is done manually by a pathologist visually examining glass (or digital) slides subtle morphologic and architectural differences of histological attributes, in addition to other factors, may result in grading errors and hence cause high inter-observer variability. Recently some researchers have proposed computerized decision support systems to automatically grade Gleason patterns by using features pertaining to nuclear architecture, gland morphology, as well as tissue texture. Automated characterization of gland morphology has been shown to distinguish between intermediate Gleason patterns 3 and 4 with high accuracy. Manifold learning (ML) schemes attempt to generate a low dimensional manifold representation of a higher dimensional feature space while simultaneously preserving nonlinear relationships between object instances. Classification can then be performed in the low dimensional space with high accuracy. However ML is sensitive to the samples contained in the dataset; changes in the dataset may alter the manifold structure. In this paper we present a manifold regularization technique to constrain the low dimensional manifold to a specific range of possible manifold shapes, the range being determined via a statistical shape model of manifolds (SSMM). In this work we demonstrate applications of the SSMM in (1) identifying samples on the manifold which contain noise, defined as those samples which deviate from the SSMM, and (2) accurate out-of-sample extrapolation (OSE) of newly acquired samples onto a manifold constrained by the SSMM. We demonstrate these applications of the SSMM in the context of distinguish between Gleason patterns 3 and 4 using glandular morphologic features in a prostate histopathology dataset of 58 patient studies. Identifying and eliminating noisy samples from the manifold via the SSMM results in a statistically significant improvement in area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.832+/-0.048 with removal of noisy samples compared to a AUC of 0.779+/-0.075 without removal of samples. The use of the SSMM for OSE of newly acquired glands also shows statistically significant improvement in AUC, 0.834+/-0.051 with the SSMM compared to 0.779+/-0.054 without the SSMM. Similar results were observed for the synthetic Swiss Roll and Helix datasets.},

abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most frequently occurring cancerous tumors in children. The current grading evaluations for patients with this disease require pathologists to identify certain morphological characteristics with microscopic examinations of tumor tissues. Thanks to the advent of modern digital scanners, it is now feasible to scan cross-section tissue specimens and acquire whole-slide digital images. As a result, computerized analysis of these images can generate key quantifiable parameters and assist pathologists with grading evaluations. In this study, image analysis techniques are applied to histological images of haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slides for identifying image regions associated with different pathological components. Texture features derived from segmented components of tissues are extracted and processed by an automated classifier group trained with sample images with different grades of neuroblastic differentiation in a multi-resolution framework. The trained classification system is tested on 33 whole-slide tumor images. The resulting whole-slide classification accuracy produced by the computerized system is 87.88%. Therefore, the developed system is a promising tool to facilitate grading whole-slide images of NB biopsies with high throughput.},

abstract = {BackgroundDendrites of cortical neurons are widely spread across several layers of the cortex. Recently developed two-photon microscopy systems are capable of visualizing the morphology of neurons within deeper layers of the brain and generate large amounts of volumetric imaging data from living tissue. MethodFor visual exploration of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of dendrites and the connectivity among neurons in the brain, we propose a visualization software and interface for 3D images based on a new transfer function design using volume rendered feature spaces. This software enables the visualization of multidimensional descriptors of shape and texture extracted from imaging data to characterize tissue. It also allows the efficient analysis and visualization of large data sets. ResultsWe apply and demonstrate the software to two-photon microscopy images of a living mouse brain. By applying the developed visualization software and algorithms to two-photon microscope images of the mouse brain, we identified a set of feature values that distinguish characteristic structures such as soma, dendrites and apical dendrites in mouse brain. Also, the visualization interface was compared to conventional 1D/2D transfer function system. ConclusionsWe have developed a visualization tool and interface that can represent 3D feature values as textures and shapes. This visualization system allows the analysis and characterization of the higher-dimensional feature values of living tissues at the micron level and will contribute to new discoveries in basic biology and clinical medicine. Interactive visualization software for 3D microscope images is developed.A new transfer function design using volume rendered feature spaces is proposed.Multidimensional features are directly utilized for volume exploration.Two-photon microscope images of live mice are applied to the developed software.Soma, dendrites and apical dendrites are visualized using 3D feature spaces.},

Rats in first five experimental groups for the four-day and the other five groups for twenty-day were examined. (2)Data processing: by the help of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) method, obtaining low-dimensional image features (color, shape and texture) and classifying five different group characteristics by using these features with artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) have been provided. (3)Calculation of drug effectiveness: firstly to determine the differences between group characteristics of rats, a pilot group has been selected (diseased group-CCl4), and the responses of ANN and SVM trained by HOG features have been calculated.

abstract = {Highlights A study about prostate cancer grading in digital histology. We analyze the prostate tissue structure by segmenting glands from the tissue. Structural features are extracted and used for the classification of a tissue pattern. A hierarchical scheme employing both the proposed method and the texture-based method. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to grade prostate malignancy using digitized histopathological specimens of the prostate tissue. Most of the approaches proposed in the literature to address this problem utilize various textural features computed from the prostate tissue image. Our approach differs in that we only focus on the tissue structure and the well-known Gleason grading system specification. The color space representing the tissue image is investigated and basic components of the prostate tissue are detected. The components and their structural relationship constitute a complete gland region. Tissue structural features extracted from gland morphology are used to classify a tissue pattern into three major categories: benign, grade 3 carcinoma and grade 4 carcinoma. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a texture-based method in the three-class classification problem and most of the two-class classification problems except for the grade 3 vs grade 4 classification. Based on these results, we propose a hierarchical (binary) classification scheme which utilizes the two methods and obtains 85.6% accuracy in classifying an input tissue pattern into one of the three classes.},

abstract = {Providing an improved technique which can assist pathologists in correctly classifying meningioma tumours with a significant accuracy is our main objective. The proposed technique, which is based on optimum texture measure combination, inspects the separability of the RGB colour channels and selects the channel which best segments the cell nuclei of the histopathological images. The morphological gradient was applied to extract the region of interest for each subtype and for elimination of possible noise (e.g. cracks) which might occur during biopsy preparation. Meningioma texture features are extracted by four different texture measures (two model-based and two statistical-based) and then corresponding features are fused together in different combinations after excluding highly correlated features, and a Bayesian classifier was used for meningioma subtype discrimination. The combined Gaussian Markov random field and run-length matrix texture measures outperformed all other combinations in terms of quantitatively characterising the meningioma tissue, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 92.50%, improving from 83.75% which is the best accuracy achieved if the texture measures are used individually.},

abstract = {Objective: This paper focuses on the use of image-based machine learning techniques in medical image analysis. In particular, we present some variants of local binary patterns (LBP), which are widely considered the state of the art among texture descriptors. After we provide a detailed review of the literature about existing LBP variants and discuss the most salient approaches, along with their pros and cons, we report new experiments using several LBP-based descriptors and propose a set of novel texture descriptors for the representation of biomedical images. The standard LBP operator is defined as a gray-scale invariant texture measure, derived from a general definition of texture in a local neighborhood. Our variants are obtained by considering different shapes for the neighborhood calculation and different encodings for the evaluation of the local gray-scale difference. These sets of features are then used for training a machine-learning classifier (a stand-alone support vector machine). Methods and materials: Extensive experiments are conducted using the following three datasets:*A database of neonatal facial images for classifying pain states starting from facial features. *The 2D-HeLa dataset for cell phenotype image classification starting from fluorescent microscope images. *Pap smear datasets for detecting abnormal smear cells.  Results and conclusion: Our results show that the novel variant named elongated quinary patterns (EQP) is a very performing method among those proposed in this work for extracting information from a texture in all the tested datasets. EQP is based on an elliptic neighborhood and a 5 levels scale for encoding the local gray-scale difference. Particularly interesting are the results on the widely studied 2D-HeLa dataset, where, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed descriptor obtains the highest performance among all the several texture descriptors tested in the literature.},

Derived from the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) computation over DRVC (CDF-DRVC), the robust cumulative histogram presents the INIs-texture-carrying intensity data as non-decreasing distributions, leading to an accurate estimation of intensities in the texture feature extraction. Beyond the proposed CDF-DRVC methodology, we introduce a methodology of feature synthesis to enhance the quality of feature representations. The experiments are conducted on irregular microscopic images (where variations in size and shape occur) in the binary classes of healthy and sick cases related to OPMD. The proposed framework achieves a higher accuracy rate for the detection as compared to other methods, and exhibits a detection strategy for other types of PCD in medical applications.},

Histopathological examination is an important stage for further treatment planning in routine clinical diagnosis of NB. According to the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (the Shimada system), NB patients are classified into favorable and unfavorable histology based on the tissue morphology. In this study, we propose an image analysis system that operates on digitized H&amp;E stained whole-slide NB tissue samples and classifies each slide as either stroma-rich or stroma-poor based on the degree of Schwannian stromal development. Our statistical framework performs the classification based on texture features extracted using co-occurrence statistics and local binary patterns. Due to the high resolution of digitized whole-slide images, we propose a multi-resolution approach that mimics the evaluation of a pathologist such that the image analysis starts from the lowest resolution and switches to higher resolutions when necessary. We employ an offline feature selection step, which determines the most discriminative features at each resolution level during the training step. A modified k-nearest neighbor classifier is used to determine the confidence level of the classification to make the decision at a particular resolution level. The proposed approach was independently tested on 43 whole-slide samples and provided an overall classification accuracy of 88.4%.},

abstract = {The reproductive system is a specific system of organs working together for the purpose of reproduction. As one of the most significant characteristics of human cell, subcellular localization plays a critical role for understanding specific functions of mammalian proteins. In this study, we developed a novel computational protocol for predicting protein subcellular locations from microscope images of cells in human reproductive tissues. Three major steps are contained in this protocol, i.e., protein object identification, image feature extraction, and classification. We first separated protein and DNA staining in the images with both linear and non-negative matrix factorization separation methods; then we extracted protein multi-view global and local texture features including wavelet Haralick, local binary patterns, local ternary patterns, and the local quinary patterns; finally based on the selected important feature subset, we constructed an ensemble classifier with support vector machines for classifications. Experiments are performed on a benchmark dataset consisting of seven major subcellular classes in human reproductive tissues collected from human protein atlas. Our results show that the local texture pattern features play an important complementary role to global features for enhancing the prediction performance. An overall accuracy of 85% is obtained through current system, and when only confident classifications are considered, the accuracy can reach 99%. It is the first developed image based protein subcellular location predictor specifically for human reproductive tissue. The promising results indicate that the developed protocol can be applied for accurate large-scale protein subcellular localization annotations in human reproductive system.},

We previously showed that cytoplasmic poly-adenylated mRNAs form mRNA granules in post-ischemic neurons and that these granules correlated with protein synthesis inhibition and hence cell death. Here we utilized the texture analysis software MaZda to quantify mRNA granules in photomicrographs of the pyramidal cell layer of rat hippocampal region CA3 around 1h of reperfusion after 10min of normothermic global cerebral ischemia. At 1h reperfusion, we observed variations in the texture of mRNA granules amongst samples that were readily quantified by texture analysis. Individual sample variation was consistent with the interpretation that animal-to-animal variations in mRNA granules reflected the time-course of mRNA granule formation. We also used texture analysis to quantify the effect of cycloheximide, given either before or after brain ischemia, on mRNA granules. If administered before ischemia, cycloheximide inhibited mRNA granule formation, but if administered after ischemia did not prevent mRNA granulation, indicating mRNA granule formation is dependent on dissociation of polysomes. We conclude that texture analysis is an effective means for quantifying the complex morphological changes induced in neurons by brain ischemia and reperfusion.},

abstract = {Modern haptic interfaces are adept at conveying the large-scale shape of virtual objects, but they often provide unrealistic or no feedback when it comes to the microscopic details of surface texture. Direct texture-rendering challenges the state of the art in haptics because it requires a finely detailed model of the surface's properties, real-time dynamic simulation of complex interactions, and high-bandwidth haptic output to enable the user to feel the resulting contacts. This paper presents a new, fully realized solution for creating realistic virtual textures. Our system employs a sensorized handheld tool to capture the feel of a given texture, recording three-dimensional tool acceleration, tool position, and contact force over time. We reduce the three-dimensional acceleration signals to a perceptually equivalent one-dimensional signal, and then we use linear predictive coding to distill this raw haptic information into a database of frequency-domain texture models. Finally, we render these texture models in real time on a Wacom tablet using a stylus augmented with small voice coil actuators. The resulting virtual textures provide a compelling simulation of contact with the real surfaces, which we verify through a human subject study.},

Automatic image analysis methods offer the possibility to obtain consistent, objective and rapid diagnoses of histopathology specimens. In breast cancer biopsies immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for ER, cancer cell nuclei present a large variety in their characteristics that bring various difficulties for traditional image analysis methods. In this paper, we propose a new automatic method to perform both segmentation and classification of breast cell nuclei in order to give quantitative assessment and uniform indicators of IHC staining that will help pathologists in their diagnostic. Firstly, a color geometric active contour model incorporating a spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed to detect the contours of all cell nuclei in the image. Secondly, overlapping and touching nuclei are separated using an improved watershed algorithm based on a concave vertex graph. Finally, to identify positive and negative stained nuclei, all the segmented nuclei are classified into five categories according to their staining intensity and morphological features using a trained multilayer neural network combined with Fisher's linear discriminant preprocessing. The proposed method is tested on a large dataset containing several breast tissue images with different levels of malignancy. The experimental results show high agreement between the results of the method and ground-truth from the pathologist panel. Furthermore, a comparative study versus existing techniques is presented in order to demonstrate the efficiency and the superiority of the proposed method.},

abstract = {With the digital all-sky imager (ASI) emergence in aurora research, millions of images are captured annually. However, only a fraction of which can be actually used. To address the problem incurred by low efficient manual processing, an integrated image analysis and retrieval system is developed. For precisely representing aurora image, macroscopic and microscopic features are combined to describe aurora texture. To reduce the feature dimensionality of the huge dataset, a modified local binary pattern (LBP) called ALBP is proposed to depict the microscopic texture, and scale-invariant Gabor and orientation-invariant Gabor are employed to extract the macroscopic texture. A physical property of aurora is inducted as region features to bridge the gap between the low-level visual features and high-level semantic description. The experiments results demonstrate that the ALBP method achieves high classification rate and low computational complexity. The retrieval simulation results show that the developed retrieval system is efficient for huge dataset.},

abstract = {This paper describes a fully automatic approach to locate icosahedral virus particles in transmission electron microscopy images. The initial detection of the particles takes place through automatic segmentation of the entropy-proportion image; this image is computed in particular regions of interest defined by two concentric structuring elements contained in a small overlapping window running over all the image. Morphological features help to select the candidates, as the threshold is kept low enough to avoid false negatives. The candidate points are subject to a credibility test based on features extracted from eight radial intensity profiles in each point from a texture image. A candidate is accepted if these features meet the set of acceptance conditions describing the typical intensity profiles of these kinds of particles. The set of points accepted is subjected to a last validation in a three-parameter space using a discrimination plan that is a function of the input image to separate possible outliers.},

abstract = {Motivation:  A key element in understanding the aging of  Caenorhabditis elegans  is objective quantification of the morphological differences between younger and older animals. Here we propose to use the image texture entropy as an objective measurement that reflects the structural deterioration of the  C.elegans  muscle tissues during aging.  Results:  The texture entropy and directionality of the muscle microscopy images were measured using 50 animals on Days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of adulthood. Results show that the entropy of the  C.elegans  pharynx tissues increases as the animal ages, but a sharper increase was measured between Days 2 and 4, and between Days 8 and 10. These results are in agreement with gene expression findings, and support the contention that the process of  C.elegans  aging has several distinct stages. This can indicate that  C.elegans  aging is driven by developmental pathways, rather than stochastic accumulation of damage.

abstract = {Alteration and addition to valuable data on paper documents are among the fastest growing crimes around the globe. The loss due to these crimes is huge and is increasing with an alarming rate. The techniques, which are used by forensic document examiners, to examine such cases are still limited to manual examination of physical, chemical and microscopic characteristics. Moreover, it is very difficult to detect an alteration when the ink of similar color is involved. We could not find much in the literature to deal with this problem in an automated pattern recognition framework. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to alterations made with ball-point pen strokes and propose a scheme for detection of such alterations using pattern recognition tools. For this, a large set of color and texture based features is extracted. To choose an adequate set of useful features from the extracted ones, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based feature analysis technique is used. For detection of the alteration, three different classifiers, namely, ${rm K}$-nearest neighbor, MLP and support vector machines are used. The results are quite promising.},

abstract = {Leading-edge science and engineering depend on advanced computing for understanding, prediction, and control. In response to these needs, the field of computational science and engineering (CS&amp;E) is evolving rapidly, to the point that it is now widely considered to be a new discipline by itself and a third pillar of the scientific enterprise, a peer alongside theory and physical experiment. CS&amp;E is unique in that it enables progress in virtually all other disciplines by providing windows of discovery when traditional means of research reach their limits.Because of its flexibility, computer simulation has become a universal tool. A simulation may serve as a virtual microscope that lets scientists observe the world of quantum physics much smaller than an atom, or it may be employed as a virtual telescope that allows us to explore how galaxies are forming in the universe. In this way, CS&amp;E helps scientists to reach beyond our physical limitations in space and time. When physical experiments are too dangerous, too time-consuming, too expensive, or simply impossible, then advanced simulation techniques enable us to perform virtual experiments and to obtain scientific results otherwise beyond our capabilities.Just as scientists employ computer simulations to improve our understanding of the world, engineers can use them to design better products. Virtual prototypes—simulated devices and processes—can increasingly replace their real counterparts to save time and to reduce cost, while simulation-based optimization techniques help engineers to develop better products. CS&amp;E is used for research into innovative materials, to make vehicles safer and environmentally friendlier, to construct buildings that can withstand earthquakes and hurricanes, to improve energy efficiency everywhere, and to advance health care, among many other applications.To begin CS&amp;E research into a specific problem, researchers generally build a simulator that can correctly represent what has been experimentally observed. The creation of a successful simulator is often a very useful accomplishment in itself, since the work required for such a creation will typically lead to a much improved understanding of the physics (or chemistry, etc.) behind the observations. A working simulation will illuminate which effects are essential in the physics under study, which are essential for the observed behavior, and which can be neglected. In this phase, relatively simple scenarios and model geometries will often be sufficient to perform the necessary work. For example, it may be that a simple two-dimensional model will enable researchers to explore the essential mechanism under consideration. Up to this level, qualitative results are often sufficient.However, as computational modeling continues to develop, CS&amp;E research will aim to develop computational models that are sophisticated enough to be predictive. Good predictions will require quantitative accuracy, as well as the ability to address more complicated scenarios. This is often very difficult in practice. For example, methods that have been proven useful for computing the flow in rectangular driven cavities may still be very far from suitable in predicting the flow in an aneurysm in the human brain. Data structures and boundary conditions along with data input and output become much more challenging at this stage.Once CS&amp;E research has progressed to the level of being predictive, the final and ultimate step it must take to become indispensable in an engineering application is optimization. In general, an engineer wants to understand and make predictions about a device because he or she wants to improve the design; thus, he or she will want to use computing to compare different design choices and to decide how an engineering problem may be solved in the best possible way. Too often, practice in CS&amp;E is still that a human varies the parameters, and predictive simulation is used to evaluate how well design criteria have been met. CS&amp;E must enable the researcher to perform these optimization tasks seamlessly within a single model.In addition to application domain knowledge, CS&amp;E research requires expertise in advanced computing (elements of applied mathematics, scientific computing, and computer science). Additionally, many CS&amp;E tasks involve complex data analysis to provide suitable input for the computations and visualizations required to help humans interpret the simulation outcome. Thus, many CS&amp;E problems can be characterized by a pipeline that includes modeling techniques (mathematical and geometric), simulation techniques (discretizations, algorithms, data structures, software frameworks, and problem solving environments), and analysis techniques (data mining, data management, visualization, as well as error, sensitivity, stability, and uncertainty analyses).This special issue on CS&amp;E of the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing is the result of a special call for papers that was announced at the SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering held in Costa Mesa, California, February 19-23, 2007. Eighty-nine papers were submitted to the special issue and subjected to a review process as rigorous as the standard review procedures of the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing. Three guest editors-in-chief headed an editorial board of 22 well-known researchers in CS&amp;E. After a peer review process with two or more anonymous referees for each paper, 26 papers were eventually selected for publication and are now collected in this volume. The editors would herewith like to thank all contributors, including those whose papers do not appear in this volume. Several of these submissions may eventually appear as regular papers in SISC or other journals. As a result of our strict selectivity, we believe that this volume may be considered a milestone of case studies marking the current state of the art for research in CS&amp;E by example.As these papers clearly illustrate, CS&amp;E research does not primarily seek to achieve new results for a given domain science but rather to provide new computational tools to researchers. Even though these tools are regularly developed to address challenging problems in specific domain sciences, they are generally transferable to other applications. For example, a method to simulate large ensembles of interacting particles may be useful to an astrophysicist studying galaxy formation as well as to a nanotechnology researcher exploring molecular dynamics. If the methods were not transferable to other applications, a collection of papers of such wide span of different applications into a single volume would be of dubious value. Ultimately, CS&amp;E aims at developing a universal set of simulation methods and tools for the scientists and engineers of the future.Nevertheless, high-level CS&amp;E research differs from research in mathematics or computer science in that it is oriented at one or more realistic applications of a domain science or engineering discipline. Such problems often involve complicated three-dimensional geometries, multiple interacting scales, heterogeneities, anisotropies, and multiphysical or biological descriptions. Thus, they often thwart rigorous proofs of accuracy or efficiency, and so CS&amp;E research must regularly address validation and verification by other means than traditional mathematical analysis.Additionally, CS&amp;E research cannot be limited to any single step of the simulation pipeline. A mathematical simulation algorithm is useful in CS&amp;E only when it is also implemented on a real computer, and a new parallel processing paradigm becomes relevant for CS&amp;E only when it is demonstrated to be applicable for a large-scale numerical computation. Of course, research for an individual piece of the CS&amp;E pipeline, such as the development of a new finite element method, may also be very useful for progress in CS&amp;E, but taken by itself such a development remains merely work in numerical analysis. In other words, CS&amp;E is not just a new name for existing computational disciplines, nor—least of all—is it just mathematics in which the proofs are half finished. In fact, as opposed to other mathematical sciences, CS&amp;E often achieves its progress through a clever combination of techniques and methods employed for the different stages of the CS&amp;E pipeline. In such a case, the innovation of excellent research may consist in the creativity needed to synthesize a computational solution for a complex problem from the right building blocks.Since this is a genuine volume on CS&amp;E, it is impossible to classify the papers in it into single subtopics of CS&amp;E. Just as genuine CS&amp;E research must synthesize its solution from various building blocks, so each of these papers addresses several aspects of what we consider to be typical of CS&amp;E research. Therefore, the assignment of a paper to any single such category is necessarily somewhat arbitrary. However, all papers of this special issue share a focus on the development of innovative computational methodology in the context of challenging applications, in the spirit of our rationale above.Flow problems, when interpreted in a wide sense, form the largest class of applications that occurs in this special issue. This section includes papers on iterative solvers for flow problems, such as “Newton-GMRES Preconditioning for Discontinuous Galerkin Discretizations of the Navier-Stokes Equations” by Persson and Peraire and turbulence modeling in “A Galerkin-Characteristic Method for Large-Eddy Simulation of Turbulent Flow and Heat Transfer” by El Amrani and Seaid. The flow applications in this volume span the scales, from climate modeling in “A New Approach to Atmospheric General Circulation Model: Global Cloud Resolving Model NICAM and Its Computational Performance” by Tomita, Goto, and Satoh to microfluidics in “Numerical Simulation of Particle Transport in a Drift Ratchet” by Brenk, Bungartz, Mehl, Muntean, Neckel, and Weinzierl. Also dealing with flow problems are “Hybrid Simulations of Reaction-Diffusion Systems in Porous Media” by Tartakovsky, Tartakovsky, Scheibe, and Meakin and “Output Functional Control for Nonlinear Equations Driven by Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation: The Navier-Stokes Equations” by Micheletti and Perotto. Reflecting a current trend in computational methods research, four papers in this volume deal with biomedical applications. They include “A Parallel Multilevel Technique for Solving the Bidomain Equation on a Human Heart with Purkinje Fibers and a Torso Model” by Washio, Okada, and Hisada; “Bridging Scales: A Three-Dimensional Electromechanical Finite Element Model of Skeletal Muscle” by Roehrle, Davidson, and Pullan; “Parallel Minimum $p$-Norm Solution of the Biomagnetic Inverse Problem for Realistic Signals Using Exact Hessian-Vector Products” by B\"{u}cker, Buecker, and Rupp; and “Long-Time Simulations on High Resolution Meshes to Model Calcium Waves in a Heart Cell” by Gobbert.Adaptive methods in which the evolving solution and some aspect of the method (typically the discretization, but increasingly algorithmic parameters as well) interact so that the latter may be optimized, have been and clearly will remain a hot topic in CS&amp;E research. Papers such as “PML Enhanced with a Self-Adaptive Goal-Oriented $hp$-Finite Element Method: Simulation of Through-Casing Borehole Resistivity Measurements” by Pardo, Demkowicz, Torres-Verd\'{\i}n, and Michler; “A Framework for the Adaptive Finite Element Solution of Large-Scale Inverse Problems” by Bangerth; and “Adaptive Discrete Galerkin Methods Applied to the Chemical Master Equation” by Deuflhard, Huisinga, Jahnke, and Wulkow illustrate such adaptive techniques in complex applications.Reflecting a growth area whose techniques now have a home in a specialized SIAM journal, several papers are concerned with image processing, including “Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Nonparametric Image Registration” by Haber, Heldmann, and Modersitzki; “A Variational Shape Optimization Approach for Image Segmentation with the Mumford-Shah Functional” by Dogan, Morin, and Nochetto; and “Brain-Tumor Interaction Biophysical Models for Medical Image Registration” by Hogea, Davatzikos, and Biros.Two papers deal with fast transforms, including “An Adaptive Multilevel Wavelet Solver for Elliptic Equations on an Optimal Spherical Geodesic Grid” by Mehra and Kevlahan and “Fast Three-Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform” by Lee, Chan, and Adjeroh. The paper by Narumi, Kameoka, Taiji, and Yasuoka presents the innovative use of multicore processors for molecular dynamics under the title “Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulations on PlayStation 3 Platform Using Virtual-GRAPE Programming Model.” The focus is on stochastic modeling and simulation methods in two papers: “Fast Monte Carlo Simulation Methods for Biological Reaction-Diffusion Systems in Solution and on Surfaces” by Kerr, Bartol, Kaminsky, Dittrich, Chang, Baden, Sejnowski, and Stiles; and “Towards a Statistical Theory of Texture Evolution in Polycrystals” by Barmak, Emelianenko, Golovaty, Kinderlehrer, and Ta'asan.Finally, a group of five papers can be counted under the topic of optimization, identification and inverse problems (though these topics of course also play a role in the imaging papers above and others). The papers here include “Numerical Solution of an Inverse Problem of Imaging of Antipersonnel Land Mines by the Globally Convergent Convexification Algorithm” by Xin and Klibanov; “ORBIT: Optimization by Radial Basis Function Interpolation in Trust-Regions” by Wild, Regis, and Shoemaker; “Multigrid One-Shot Method for State Constrained Aerodynamic Shape Optimization” by Hazra; “Incremental Identification of Transport Coefficients in Convection-Diffusion Systems” by Karalashvili, Gross, Mhamdi, Reusken, and Marquardt; and “Model Reduction for Large-Scale Systems with High-Dimensional Parametric Input Space” by Bui-Thanh, Willcox, and Ghattas.To conclude, the guest editors-in-chief would like to thank again all contributors, associate editors, and the anonymous referees from industry, government laboratories, and universities across the globe for the work and enthusiasm they have put into this publication project. As SIAM seeks to chart a path on the research frontier of CS&amp;E that is responsive to the interests of its members and illuminating to a vast community of developers and users not yet SIAM members, this collection helps to define CS&amp;E, to transmit exciting developments, and above all to improve and focus our collective conversation about CS&amp;E. What is the future role of CS&amp;E in SIAM publications? This special issue complements a growing book series in leading to answers!},

Reflecting a growth area whose techniques now have a home in a specialized SIAM journal, several papers are concerned with image processing, including “Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Nonparametric Image Registration” by Haber, Heldmann, and Modersitzki; “A Variational Shape Optimization Approach for Image Segmentation with the Mumford–Shah Functional” by Dogan, Morin, and Nochetto; and “Brain–Tumor Interaction Biophysical Models for Medical Image Registration” by Hogea, Davatzikos, and Biros. Two papers deal with fast transforms, including “An Adaptive Multilevel Wavelet Solver for Elliptic Equations on an Optimal Spherical Geodesic Grid” by Mehra and Kevlahan and “Fast Three-Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform” by Lee, Chan, and Adjeroh. The paper by Narumi, Kameoka, Taiji, and Yasuoka presents the innovative use of multicore processors for molecular dynamics under the title “Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulations on PlayStation 3 Platform Using Virtual-GRAPE Programming Model.” The focus is on stochastic modeling and simulation methods in two papers: “Fast Monte Carlo Simulation Methods for Biological Reaction-Diffusion Systems in Solution and on Surfaces” by Kerr, Bartol, Kaminsky, Dittrich, Chang, Baden, Sejnowski, and Stiles; and “Towards a Statistical Theory of Texture Evolution in Polycrystals” by Barmak, Emelianenko, Golovaty, Kinderlehrer, and Ta'asan. Finally, a group of five papers can be counted under the topic of optimization, identification and inverse problems (though these topics of course also play a role in the imaging papers above and others). The papers here include “Numerical Solution of an Inverse Problem of Imaging of Antipersonnel Land Mines by the Globally Convergent Convexification Algorithm” by Xin and Klibanov; “ORBIT: Optimization by Radial Basis Function Interpolation in Trust-Regions” by Wild, Regis, and Shoemaker; “Multigrid One-Shot Method for State Constrained Aerodynamic Shape Optimization” by Hazra; “Incremental Identification of Transport Coefficients in Convection-Diffusion Systems” by Karalashvili, Gross, Mhamdi, Reusken, and Marquardt; and “Model Reduction for Large-Scale Systems with High-Dimensional Parametric Input Space” by Bui-Thanh, Willcox, and Ghattas. To conclude, the guest editors-in-chief would like to thank again all contributors, associate editors, and the anonymous referees from industry, government laboratories, and universities across the globe for the work and enthusiasm they have put into this publication project. As SIAM seeks to chart a path on the research frontier of CS&amp;E that is responsive to the interests of its members and illuminating to a vast community of developers and users not yet SIAM members, this collection helps to define CS&amp;E, to transmit exciting developments, and above all to improve and focus our collective conversation about CS&amp;E. What is the future role of CS&amp;E in SIAM publications? This special issue complements a growing book series in leading to answers!},

abstract = {The number or ratio of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of diseases. The leukocyte differential count is the process of diagnosing diseases by counting the number and ratio of leukocytes in the blood. However, leukocytes are usually manually classified in laboratories by using microscopes. It is a painstaking and subjective task for biologists. In order to improve the recognition accuracy and decrease the time consuming, an automatic leukocyte detective system is essential for assisting biologists in diagnosing diseases. This paper provides a method to detect and recognize leukocyte automatically. In general, leukocytes are categorized into five groups, including lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils. Each category plays a different role in the human immune system. The nucleus contains the main composition of a leukocyte and it can be used as an important feature to classify a disease. In this paper, the nuclei are used to identify five types of leukocyte. The leukocyte cell nucleus enhancer is proposed to segment the region we are interested in by enhancing the region of the leukocyte nucleus and suppressing the other region of the blood smear images. The segmental threshold of leukocyte nuclei is based on the Otsu's method. In addition, the erythrocyte size is estimated not only to assist the filtering out of the non-leukocyte objects but also to classify the leukocytes. Then the co-occurrence matrix is used as a textural measure of segmented images. In addition to the texture measure, we take into account of shape measures. In the recognition steps, we reduce features by principle component analysis (PCA) to obtain suitable feature to distinguish the five types of leukocytes. The genetic algorithm based k-means clustering approach is used to classify the five kinds of leukocyte in the reduced dimensions. The experimental results show that even though only leukocyte nucleus features are used for classification in our method, we achieve a high and promised accurate recognition rate.},

abstract = {Accurate and reliable classification of microscopic biopsy images is an important issue in computer assisted breast cancer diagnosis. In this paper, a new cascade Random Subspace ensembles scheme with reject options is proposed for microscopic biopsy image classification. The classification system is built as a serial fusion of two different Random Subspace classifier ensembles with rejection options to enhance the classification reliability. The first ensemble consists of a set of Support Vector Machine classifiers that converts the original  $$K$$ -class classification problem into a number of  $$K$$  2-class problems. The second ensemble consists of a Multi-Layer Perceptron ensemble, that focuses on the rejected samples from the first ensemble. For both of the ensembles, the reject option is implemented by relating the consensus degree from majority voting to a confidence measure, and abstaining to classify ambiguous samples if the consensus degree is lower than some threshold. We also investigated the effectiveness of a feature description approach by combining Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture analysis, statistics derived using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and the Curvelet Transform. While the LBP analysis efficiently describes local texture properties and the GLCM reflects global texture statistics, the Curvelet Transform is particularly appropriate for the representation of piece-wise smooth images with rich edge information. The combined feature description thus provides a comprehensive biopsy image characterization by taking advantages of their complementary strengths. Using a benchmark microscopic biopsy image dataset, obtained from the Israel Institute of Technology, a high classification accuracy of  $$99.25 %$$  was obtained (with a rejection rate of  $$1.94 %$$ ) using the proposed system.},

abstract = {The estimation of fecundity and reproductive cells (oocytes) development dynamic is essential for an accurate study of biology and population dynamics of fish species. This estimation can be developed using the stereometric method to analyse histological images of fish ovary. However, this method still requires specialised technicians and much time and effort to make routinary fecundity studies commonly used in fish stock assessment, because the available software does not allow an automatic analysis. The automatic fecundity estimation requires both the classification of cells depending on their stage of development and the measurement of their diameters, based on those cells that are cut through the nucleous within the histological slide. Human experts seem to use colour and texture properties of the image to classify cells, i.e., colour texture analysis from the computer vision point of view. In the current work, we provide an exhaustive statistical evaluation of a very wide variety of parallel and integrative texture analysis strategies, giving a total of 126 different feature vectors. Besides, a selection of 17 classifiers, representative of the currently available classification techniques, was used to classify the cells according to the presence/absence of nucleous and their stage of development. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieves the best results for nucleous (99.0% of accuracy using colour Local Binary Patterns (LPB) feature vector, integrative strategy) and for stages of development (99.6% using First Order Statistics and grey level LPB, parallel strategy) with the species Merluccius merluccius, and similar accuracies for Trisopterus luscus. These results provide a high reliability for an automatic fecundity estimation from histological images of fish ovary.},

abstract = {Patient-targeted therapies have recently been highlighted as important. An important development in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been the tailoring of therapy on the basis of histology. A pathology diagnosis of "non-specified NSCLC" is no longer routinely acceptable; an effective approach for classification of adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous carcinoma (SC) histotypes is needed for optimizing therapy. In this study, we present a robust and objective automatic computer vision system for real-time classification of AC and SC based on the morphological tissue patterns of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining images to assist medical experts in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Various original and extended densitometric and Haralick's texture features are used to extract image features, and a boosting algorithm is utilized to train the classifier, together with alternative decision tree as the base learner. For evaluation, two types of data with 653 tissue samples were tested, including 369 samples from tissue microarray data set and 284 samples from full-face tissue sections. Regarding the data distribution, 45 % are AC samples (288) and 55 % are SC samples (365), which is considerably well balanced for each class. Using tenfold cross-validation, the technique achieved high accuracy of  $$92.41~%$$  on tissue microarray cores and  $$95.42~%$$  on full tissue sections. We also found that the two boosting algorithms (cw-Boost and AdaBoost.M1) perform consistently well in comparison with other popularly adopted machine learning methods, including support vector machine, neural network and decision tree. This approach offers a robust, objective and rapid procedure for optimized patient-targeted therapy.},

Hillock formation in the Al layer was found to be strongly dependent on the deposition temperature in the range of 373-573K and less on the annealing temperature in the range of 573-773K. Hillock size and density were significantly increased when Al was sputtered on SiO"2 substrate compared to Si substrates. Al grain size was increased when sputtered from Al-Si target composition compared to Al-Si-Cu and was not influenced significantly by the annealing process. Deposition of Al films from Al-Si-Cu target composition resulted in lower hillock density and orthogonally packed fine grain structure when deposited on (100) Si substrate. Strong (111) texture of Al films on SiO"2 substrate for both target composition and (101) texture when deposited on Si substrate were determined by EBSD method.},

abstract = {Motivation: Image analysis, machine learning and statistical modeling have become well established for the automatic recognition and comparison of the subcellular locations of proteins in microscope images. By using a comprehensive set of features describing static images, major subcellular patterns can be distinguished with near perfect accuracy. We now extend this work to time series images, which contain both spatial and temporal information. The goal is to use temporal features to improve recognition of protein patterns that are not fully distinguishable by their static features alone.Results: We have adopted and designed five sets of features for capturing temporal behavior in 2D time series images, based on object tracking, temporal texture, normal flow, Fourier transforms and autoregression. Classification accuracy on an image collection for 12 fluorescently tagged proteins was increased when temporal features were used in addition to static features. Temporal texture, normal flow and Fourier transform features were most effective at increasing classification accuracy. We therefore extended these three feature sets to 3D time series images, but observed no significant improvement over results for 2D images. The methods for 2D and 3D temporal pattern analysis do not require segmentation of images into single cell regions, and are suitable for automated high-throughput microscopy applications.Availability: Images, source code and results will be available upon publication at http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software Contact: murphy@cmu.edu},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the geometric modeling and computational algorithm development of biomolecular structures from two data sources: Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) in the Eulerian (or Cartesian) representation. Molecular surface (MS) contains non-smooth geometric singularities, such as cusps, tips and self-intersecting facets, which often lead to computational instabilities in molecular simulations, and violate the physical principle of surface free energy minimization. Variational multiscale surface definitions are proposed based on geometric flows and solvation analysis of biomolecular systems. Our approach leads to geometric and potential driven Laplace-Beltrami flows for biomolecular surface evolution and formation. The resulting surfaces are free of geometric singularities and minimize the total free energy of the biomolecular system. High order partial differential equation (PDE)-based nonlinear filters are employed for EMDB data processing. We show the efficacy of this approach in feature-preserving noise reduction. After the construction of protein multiresolution surfaces, we explore the analysis and characterization of surface morphology by using a variety of curvature definitions. Apart from the classical Gaussian curvature and mean curvature, maximum curvature, minimum curvature, shape index, and curvedness are also applied to macromolecular surface analysis for the first time. Our curvature analysis is uniquely coupled to the analysis of electrostatic surface potential, which is a by-product of our variational multiscale solvation models. As an expository investigation, we particularly emphasize the numerical algorithms and computational protocols for practical applications of the above multiscale geometric models. Such information may otherwise be scattered over the vast literature on this topic. Based on the curvature and electrostatic analysis from our multiresolution surfaces, we introduce a new concept, the polarized curvature, for the prediction of protein binding sites.},

abstract = {This research work presents a quantitative approach for analysis of histomorphometric features of the basal cell nuclei in respect to their size, shape and intensity of staining, from surface epithelium of Oral Submucous Fibrosis showing dysplasia (OSFD) to that of the Normal Oral Mucosa (NOM). For all biological activity, the basal cells of the surface epithelium form the proliferative compartment and therefore their morphometric changes will spell the intricate biological behavior pertaining to normal cellular functions as well as in premalignant and malignant status. In view of this, the changes in shape, size and intensity of staining of the nuclei in the basal cell layer of the NOM and OSFD have been studied. Geometric, Zernike moments and Fourier descriptor (FD) based as well as intensity based features are extracted for histomorphometric pattern analysis of the nuclei. All these features are statistically analyzed along with 3D visualization in order to discriminate the groups. Results showed increase in the dimensions (area and perimeter), shape parameters and decreasing mean nuclei intensity of the nuclei in OSFD in respect to NOM. Further, the selected features are fed to the Bayesian classifier to discriminate normal and OSFD. The morphometric and intensity features provide a good sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 98.53% and positive predicative accuracy of 97.35%. This comparative quantitative characterization of basal cell nuclei will be of immense help for oral onco-pathologists, researchers and clinicians to assess the biological behavior of OSFD, specially relating to their premalignant and malignant potentiality. As a future direction more extensive study involving more number of disease subjects is observed.},

abstract = {Neuron morphology is frequently used to classify cell-types in the mammalian cortex. Apart from the shape of the soma and the axonal projections, morphological classification is largely defined by the dendrites of a neuron and their subcellular compartments, referred to as dendritic spines. The dimensions of a neuron's dendritic compartment, including its spines, is also a major determinant of the passive and active electrical excitability of dendrites. Furthermore, the dimensions of dendritic branches and spines change during postnatal development and, possibly, following some types of neuronal activity patterns, changes depending on the activity of a neuron. Due to their small size, accurate quantitation of spine number and structure is difficult to achieve (Larkman, J Comp Neurol 306:332, 1991). Here we follow an analysis approach using high-resolution EM techniques. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) enables automated imaging of large specimen volumes at high resolution. The large data sets generated by this technique make manual reconstruction of neuronal structure laborious. Here we present NeuroStruct, a reconstruction environment developed for fast and automated analysis of large SBFSEM data sets containing individual stained neurons using optimized algorithms for CPU and GPU hardware. NeuroStruct is based on 3D operators and integrates image information from image stacks of individual neurons filled with biocytin and stained with osmium tetroxide. The focus of the presented work is the reconstruction of dendritic branches with detailed representation of spines. NeuroStruct delivers both a 3D surface model of the reconstructed structures and a 1D geometrical model corresponding to the skeleton of the reconstructed structures. Both representations are a prerequisite for analysis of morphological characteristics and simulation signalling within a neuron that capture the influence of spines.},

abstract = {Properties of gold films sputtered onto borosilicate glass substrate were studied. UV-Vis absorption spectra were used to investigate optical parameters. XRD analysis provided information about the gold crystalline nanostructure, the texture, and lattice parameter and biaxial tension was also determined by the XRD method.The surface morphology was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM); chemical structure of sputtered gold nanostructures was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS). The gold crystallites are preferentially [111] oriented on the sputtered samples. Gold deposition leads to dramatic changes in the surface morphology in comparison to pristine glass substrate. Oxygen is not incorporated into the gold layer during gold deposition. Experimental data on lattice parameter were also confirmed by theoretical investigations of nanoclusters using tight-binding potentials.},

abstract = {In many applications of medical image analysis, the density of an object is the most important feature for isolating an area of interest (image segmentation). In this research, an object density-based image segmentation methodology is developed, which incorporates intensity-based, edge-based and texture-based segmentation techniques. The proposed method consists of three main stages: preprocessing, object segmentation and final segmentation. Image enhancement, noise reduction and layer-of-interest extraction are several subtasks of preprocessing. Object segmentation utilizes a marker-controlled watershed technique to identify each object of interest (OI) from the background. A marker estimation method is proposed to minimize over-segmentation resulting from the watershed algorithm. Object segmentation provides an accurate density estimation of OI which is used to guide the subsequent segmentation steps. The final stage converts the distribution of OI into textural energy by using fractal dimension analysis. An energy-driven active contour procedure is designed to delineate the area with desired object density. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 98% accurate in segmenting synthetic images. Segmentation of microscopic images and ultrasound images shows the potential utility of the proposed method in different applications of medical image processing.},

Therefore, the development of objective and reproducible computer-aided classification methods is of critical importance. In this paper, 16 supervised machine learning algorithms were compared based on their performance on prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. The classification problems addressed were: tumour vs. non-tumour, low vs. high grade; and the four class problem of diagnosis and grading. Thirteen Haralick texture characteristics were calculated based on grey level co-occurrence matrix of microscopic prostate tissue. For the best performing algorithm in each case the accuracy obtained was 97.9% for diagnosis (tumour-non-tumour), 80.8% for low-high grade discrimination and 77.8% for accomplishing both diagnosis and Gleason grading. Logistic regression and sequential minimal optimisation for training a support vector machine were among the four top scoring algorithms in each classification problem.},

During the exam color and texture changes are induced by the application of a contrast agent (e.g.3-5% acetic acid solution or iodine). Our aim is to densely quantify the change in the acetowhite decay level for a sequence of images captured during a colposcopy exam to help the physician in his diagnosis providing new tools that overcome subjectivity and improve reproducibility. As the change in acetowhite decay level must be calculated from the same tissue point in all images, we present an elastic image registration scheme able to compensate patient, camera and tissue movement robustly in cervical images. The image registration is based on a novel multi-feature entropy similarity criterion. Temporal features are then extracted using the color properties of the aligned image sequence and a dual compartment tissue model of the cervix. An example of the use of the temporal features for pixel-wise classification is presented and the results are compared against ground truth histopathological annotations.},

Bi-Te films with the composition of around 61at.% Te and the thickness of 300nm were deposited onto SiO"2-coated Si substrates by using bismuth and tellurium targets in a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering system. We annealed the films at different temperatures (100, 150 and 200^oC) under N"2 ambient for 8h, and characterized the crystallinity and morphology of the Bi-Te films. Microstructure characterization using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy disclosed that the post-annealing treatment entailed a drastic microstructural evolution by inducing the development of a strong texture of grains with their c-axis oriented normal to the substrate. In addition, we measured the electrical transport and thermoelectric properties of the films to reveal their close link with the microstructure changes. The electron mobility and Seebeck coefficient increase significantly, leading to a remarkable improvement in the power factor from 3.3@mW/K^2cm for the as-deposited sample to 24.1@mW/K^2cm for the 200^oC-annealed sample.},

abstract = {Due to the limited depth of field of brightfield microscopes, it is usually impossible to image thick specimens entirely in focus. By optically sectioning the specimen, the in-focus information at the specimen's surface can be acquired over a range of images. Commonly based on a high-pass criterion, extended-depth-of-field methods aim at combining the in-focus information from these images into a single image of the texture on the specimen's surface. The topography provided by such methods is usually limited to a map of selected in-focus pixel positions and is inherently discretized along the axial direction, which limits its use for quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we propose a method that jointly estimates the texture and topography of a specimen from a series of brightfield optical sections; it is based on an image formation model that is described by the convolution of a thick specimen model with the microscope's point spread function. The problem is stated as a least-squares minimization where the texture and topography are updated alternately. This method also acts as a deconvolution when the in-focus PSF has a blurring effect, or when the true in-focus position falls in between two optical sections. Comparisons to state-of-the-art algorithms and experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {A multilevel aggregation method is applied to the problem of segmenting live cell bright field microscope images. The method employed is a variant of the so-called "Segmentation by Weighted Aggregation" technique, which itself is based on Algebraic Multigrid methods. The variant of the method used is described in detail, and it is explained how it is tailored to the application at hand. In particular, a new scale-invariant "saliency measure" is proposed for deciding when aggregates of pixels constitute salient segments that should not be grouped further. It is shown how segmentation based on multilevel intensity similarity alone does not lead to satisfactory results for bright field cells. However, the addition of multilevel intensity variance (as a measure of texture) to the feature vector of each aggregate leads to correct cell segmentation. Preliminary results are presented for applying the multilevel aggregation algorithm in space time to temporal sequences of microscope images, with the goal of obtaining space-time segments ("object tunnels") that track individual cells. The advantages and drawbacks of the space-time aggregation approach for segmentation and tracking of live cells in sequences of bright field microscope images are presented, along with a discussion on how this approach may be used in the future work as a building block in a complete and robust segmentation and tracking system.},

abstract = {Most technologically useful materials possess polycrystalline microstructures composed of a large number of small monocrystalline grains separated by grain boundaries. The energetics and connectivity of the grain boundary network play a crucial role in determining the properties of a material across a wide range of scales. A central problem in materials science is to develop technologies capable of producing an arrangement of grains—a texture—that provides for a desired set of material properties. One of the most challenging aspects of this problem is to understand the role of topological reconfigurations during coarsening. Here we propose an upscaling procedure suitable for large complex systems. The procedure is based on numerical experimentation combined with stochastic tools and consists of large-scale numerical simulations of a system at a microscopic level, statistical analysis of the microscopic data, and formulation of the model based on stochastic characteristics predicted by the statistical analysis. This approach promises to be valuable in establishing the effective model of microstructural evolution in realistic two- and three-dimensional systems. To test ideas we use our upscaling procedure to study the mesoscopic behavior of a reduced one-dimensional network of grain boundaries. Despite the simplicity of its formulation, this model exhibits highly nontrivial behavior characterized by growth and disappearance of grain boundaries and develops probability distributions similar to those observed in higher-dimensional simulations. Here we focus on the grain deletion events which are common to all coarsening systems.},

The system uses an image database containing digitized specimens from normal and four different hematologic malignancies. Initially, the nuclei and cytoplasmic components of the specimens are segmented using a robust color gradient vector flow active contour model. Using a few cell images from each class, the basic texture elements (textons) for the nuclei and cytoplasm are learned, and the cells are represented through texton histograms. We propose to use support vector machines on the texton histogram based cell representation and achieve major improvement over the commonly used classification methods in texture research. Experiments with 3,691 cell images from 105 patients which originated from four different hospitals indicate more than 84% classification performance for individual cells and 89% for case based classification for the five class problem.},

abstract = {Motivation:  Optical flow is a key method used for quantitative motion estimation of biological structures in light microscopy. It has also been used as a key module in segmentation and tracking systems and is considered a mature technology in the field of computer vision. However, most of the research focused on 2D natural images, which are small in size and rich in edges and texture information. In contrast, 3D time-lapse recordings of biological specimens comprise up to several terabytes of image data and often exhibit complex object dynamics as well as blurring due to the point-spread-function of the microscope. Thus, new approaches to optical flow are required to improve performance for such data.  Results:  We solve optical flow in large 3D time-lapse microscopy datasets by defining a Markov random field (MRF) over super-voxels in the foreground and applying motion smoothness constraints between super-voxels instead of voxel-wise. This model is tailored to the specific characteristics of light microscopy datasets: super-voxels help registration in textureless areas, the MRF over super-voxels efficiently propagates motion information between neighboring cells and the background subtraction and super-voxels reduce the dimensionality of the problem by an order of magnitude. We validate our approach on large 3D time-lapse datasets of  Drosophila  and zebrafish development by analyzing cell motion patterns. We show that our approach is, on average, 10 \texttimes{} faster than commonly used optical flow implementations in the Insight Tool-Kit (ITK) and reduces the average flow end point error by 50% in regions with complex dynamic processes, such as cell divisions.

First, the morphological and textural discriminatory features used in classification schemes are measured using a computer-controlled stage and a digital camera mounted on a microscope in combination with Halcon image analysis algorithms. Second, the Exhaustive CHi-square Automatic Interaction Detector classification tree algorithm is applied to all feature measurements to establish their saliency as classification discriminators. Thirdly, the results of the classification tree algorithm are used to determine the inputs used by the actual classifier, which consists of a series of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The Gamma test (GT) is introduced as a tool to help facilitate the best use of limited data and to ensure that the ANNs are not over trained. The results show that the system developed is able to achieve an average correct classification rate of 87%. This is encouraging enough to prompt further research that could result in a commercially viable system. In the future, work will concentrate on refining the image capture component of the system and increasing the size of those databases that have been shown both empirically and by the GT to be too small to facilitate the construction of accurate classifiers.},

abstract = {Leukemia is a malignant neoplasm of the blood or bone marrow that affects both children and adults and remains a leading cause of death around the world. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia and is more common among children and young adults. ALL diagnosis through microscopic examination of the peripheral blood and bone marrow tissue samples is performed by hematologists and has been an indispensable technique long since. However, such visual examinations of blood samples are often slow and are also limited by subjective interpretations and less accurate diagnosis. The objective of this work is to improve the ALL diagnostic accuracy by analyzing morphological and textural features from the blood image using image processing. This paper aims at proposing a quantitative microscopic approach toward the discrimination of lymphoblasts (malignant) from lymphocytes (normal) in stained blood smear and bone marrow samples and to assist in the development of a computer-aided screening of ALL. Automated recognition of lymphoblasts is accomplished using image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification over light microscopic images of stained blood films. Accurate and authentic diagnosis of ALL is obtained with the use of improved segmentation methodology, prominent features, and an ensemble classifier, facilitating rapid screening of patients. Experimental results are obtained and compared over the available image data set. It is observed that an ensemble of classifiers leads to 99 % accuracy in comparison with other standard classifiers, i.e., naive Bayesian (NB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis functional network (RBFN), and support vector machines (SVM).},

abstract = {Volume visualization is an important technique for analyzing datasets from a variety of different scientific domains. Volume data analysis is inherently difficult because volumes are three-dimensional, dense, and unfamiliar, requiring scientists to precisely control the viewpoint and to make precise spatial judgments. Researchers have proposed that more immersive (higher fidelity) VR systems might improve task performance with volume datasets, and significant results tied to different components of display fidelity have been reported. However, more information is needed to generalize these results to different task types, domains, and rendering styles. We visualized isosurfaces extracted from synchrotron microscopic computed tomography (SR-μCT) scans of beetles, in a CAVE-like display. We ran a controlled experiment evaluating the effects of three components of system fidelity (field of regard, stereoscopy, and head tracking) on a variety of abstract task categories that are applicable to various scientific domains, and also compared our results with those from our prior experiment using 3D texture-based rendering. We report many significant findings. For example, for search and spatial judgment tasks with isosurface visualization, a stereoscopic display provides better performance, but for tasks with 3D texture-based rendering, displays with higher field of regard were more effective, independent of the levels of the other display components. We also found that systems with high field of regard and head tracking improve performance in spatial judgment tasks. Our results extend existing knowledge and produce new guidelines for designing VR systems to improve the effectiveness of volume data analysis.},

Layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets have been fabricated by a one-step, room-temperature, hydrothermal process on sputtered-aluminum thin substrates, in which the metal substrate acts as both reactant and support. The morphology, dimensions and composition of the obtained nanostructures have been characterized as a function of the substrate thickness by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) and photoluminescence measurements. While the lateral size of the observed LDH nanosheets depends on the available aluminum, the stoichiometry does not change appreciably. Even for the lowest values of the aluminum thickness, the excess zinc does not alter the chemical composition of LDH, but rather produces ZnO nanorods that show the characteristic defect-related broad visible photoluminescence centered at approximately 600nm. The results show that a controlled growth of Zn/Al LDH nanosheets can be achieved onto sputtered aluminum thin layers with thicknesses as low as 10nm, which can be important for the integration of LDH on generic substrates.},

abstract = {Molar pregnancy (also known as hydatidiform mole, hydatid mole, gestational trophoblastic disease) represents forms of abnormal conception caused by defective fertilisation resulting in excess expression of paternal genes in placental tissue. There are two forms of hydatidiform mole: complete (diploid androgenetic) and partial (paternal triploid), the distinction between which is important for determining appropriate prognosis and management of patients. Both complete and partial hydatidiform moles are associated with increased risk of development of malignant gestational trophoblastic tumours, the risk being much greater for complete hydatidiform moles. Whilst in most cases the diagnosis of these moles can be reliably achieved on morphological histological assessment, these represent a continuing diagnostic problem for histopathologists since in early pregnancy complete hydatidiform moles, partial hydatidiform moles and non-molar hydropic miscarriages may be difficult to distinguish. In this paper, we propose a computational image analysis approach guided by the knowledge of expert pathologists in identifying essential distinguishing morphological criteria. The approach, which combines Fuzzy C-Means clustering with hue, saturation and value colour space, shows promising results as it is able to classify successfully the villi into appropriate regions, namely trophoblast and stroma, and extract areas of blood. However, because of the marked variations in size, shape and outline of the villi, and trophoblast proliferation, both within and between cases, the analysis shows that there is no single criteria which can reliably classify these products of conception and a combination of criteria is required.},

With variations in size, shape, and background structure, a total of 600 microscopic images are analyzed for the binary classes of healthy and sick conditions of OPMD. The integrated technique of the approach reveals a sensitivity of 0.9 and an area of 0.961 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) at a specificity of 0.95.

abstract = {Generally, pathological diagnosis using an electron microscope is time-consuming and likely to result in a subjective judgment, because pathologists perform manual screening of tissue slides at high magnifications. Recently, the advent of digital pathology technology has provided the basis for convenient screening and quantitative analysis by digitizing tissue slides through a computer system. However, a screening process with high magnification still takes quite a long time. To solve these problems, recently the use of computer-aided design techniques for performing pathologic diagnosis has been increasing in digital pathology. For pathological diagnosis, we need different diagnostic methods for different regions with different characteristics. Therefore, in order to effectively diagnose different lesions and types of diseases, a quantitative method for extracting specific features is required in computerized pathologic diagnosis. This study is about an automated differential diagnosis system to differentiate between benign serous cystadenoma and possibly-malignant mucinous cystadenoma. In order to diagnose cystic tumors, the first step is identifying a cystic region and inspecting its epithelial cells. First, we identify the lumen boundary of a cyst using the Direction Cumulative Map considering 8-ways. Then, the Epithelial Nuclei Identification algorithm is used to discern epithelial nuclei. After that, three morphological features for the differential diagnosis of mucinous and serous cystadenomas are extracted. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed features, the experiments compared performance of the classifiers learned by using the proposed morphological features and the classical morphological features based on nuclei. The classifiers in the simulations are as follows; Bayesian Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network. The results show that all classifiers using the proposed features have the best classification performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the image analysis techniques in the domain of histopathology, specifically, for the objective of automated carcinoma detection and classification. As in other biomedical imaging areas such as radiology, many computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems have been implemented to aid histopathologists and clinicians in cancer diagnosis and research, which have been attempted to significantly reduce the labor and subjectivity of traditional manual intervention with histology images. The task of automated histology image analysis is usually not simple due to the unique characteristics of histology imaging, including the variability in image preparation techniques, clinical interpretation protocols, and the complex structures and very large size of the images themselves. In this paper we discuss those characteristics, provide relevant background information about slide preparation and interpretation, and review the application of digital image processing techniques to the field of histology image analysis. In particular, emphasis is given to state-of-the-art image segmentation methods for feature extraction and disease classification. Four major carcinomas of cervix, prostate, breast, and lung are selected to illustrate the functions and capabilities of existing CAD systems.},

In this paper, based on various global and local geometric features of the dendrite structure, we propose a novel approach to detect and segment neuronal spines, in particular, a breaking-down and stitching-up algorithm to accurately separate touching spines.

abstract = {Objective: This paper presents an algorithm based on multi-level watershed segmentation combined with three fuzzy systems to segment a large number of myelinated nerve fibers in microscope images. The method can estimate various geometrical parameters of myelinated nerve fibers in peripheral nerves. It is expected to be a promising tool for the quantitative assessment of myelinated nerve fibers in related research. Materials and methods: A novel multi-level watershed scheme iteratively detects pre-candidate nerve fibers. At each immersion level, watershed segmentation extracts the initial axon locations and obtains meaningful myelinated nerve fiber features. Thereafter, according to a priori characteristics of the myelinated nerve fibers, fuzzy rules reject unlikely pre-candidates and collect a set of candidates. Initial candidate boundaries are then refined by a fuzzy active contour model, which flexibly deforms contours according to the observed features of each nerve fiber. A final scan with a different set of fuzzy rules based on the a priori properties of the myelinated nerve fibers removes false detections. A particle swarm optimization method is employed to efficiently train the large number of parameters in the proposed fuzzy systems. Results: The proposed method can automatically segment the transverse cross-sections of nerve fibers obtained from optical microscope images. Although the microscope image is usually noisy with weak or variable levels of contrast, the proposed system can handle images with a large number of myelinated nerve fibers and achieve a high fiber detection ratio. As compared to manual segmentation by experts, the proposed system achieved an average accuracy of 91% across different data sets. Conclusion: We developed an image segmentation system that automatically handles myelinated nerve fibers in microscope images. Experimental results showed the efficacy of this system and its superiority to other nerve fiber segmentation approaches. Moreover, the proposed method can be extended to other applications of automatic segmentation of microscopic images.},

The ability to manage and access these collections of digital images is regarded as a key component of next generation medical imaging systems.

The proposed approach automatically annotates the images in the collection, as well as the query images, with high-level semantic concepts. This semantic representation delivers an improved retrieval performance providing more meaningful results. We model the problem of automatic image annotation using kernel methods, resulting in a unified framework that includes: (1) multiple features for image representation, (2) a feature integration and selection mechanism (3) and an automatic semantic image annotation strategy. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework to build meaningful image representations for learning and useful semantic annotations for image retrieval.},

abstract = {Many applications in non-destructive testing at a microscopic level and in live cell imaging require automated focusing due to unstable environmental conditions, moving specimen or the limited depth of field of the applied optical imaging systems. Digital holography permits the recording and the numerical reconstruction of optical wave fields in amplitude and phase. This enables imaging of multiple focal planes from a single recorded hologram without mechanical realignment. The combination of numerical refocusing with image sharpness quantification algorithms yields subsequent autofocusing. With calibrated optical imaging systems this feature can be used also to determine the position and axial displacements of a sample. In order to show the application potential of digital holographic autofocusing in microscopy the method and results from investigations on several amplitude and phase objects are reviewed. This includes a demonstration of the reliability of automated refocusing, multi-focus quantitative phase contrast imaging of suspended cells, refocusing of quantitative phase contrast images during the analysis of the temporal dependency of cell spreading on surfaces and the quantification of toxin mediated morphological cell alterations during long-term observations. It is also shown for the example of sedimenting red blood cells that the method can be applied for minimally-invasive tracking of multiple particles. Finally, the usage of numerical autofocus for quantitative migration analysis of arbitrary shaped cells in a three-dimensional collagen matrix is demonstrated.},

abstract = {In order to develop an oral formation of Amphotericin B (AmB) using phytantriol- (PYT-) based cubosomes with desirable properties, homogenization conditions were firstly investigated to determine their effects on the morphological and dimensional characteristics of cubosomes. Under the optimized homogenization conditions of 1200 bar for 9 cycles, cubosomes with reproducible, narrow particle size distribution and a mean particle size of 256.9 nm ± 4.9 nm were obtained. The structure of the dispersed cubosomes was revealed by SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) and Cryo-TEM (cryogenic transmission electron microscopy) as a bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline phase with Pn3m geometry. To overcome the poor drug solubility and increase the drug-loading rate, a solubilization method was firstly used to develop cubosomes containing AmB. The encapsulation efficiency determined by HPLC assay was 87.8% ± 3.4%, and UV spectroscopy and stability studies in simulated gastric fluids further confirmed that AmB was successfully encapsulated in cubosomes.},

abstract = {Motivation: Unraveling the structure and behavior of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) has always been a major goal of neuroscience. Understanding the wiring diagrams of the neuromuscular junction connectomes (full connectivity of nervous system neuronal components) is a starting point for this, as it helps in the study of the organizational and developmental properties of the mammalian CNS. The phenomenon of synapse elimination during developmental stages of the neuronal circuitry is such an example. Due to the organizational specificity of the axons in the connectomes, it becomes important to label and extract individual axons for morphological analysis. Features such as axonal trajectories, their branching patterns, geometric information, the spatial relations of groups of axons, etc. are of great interests for neurobiologists in the study of wiring diagrams. However, due to the complexity of spatial structure of the axons, automatically tracking and reconstructing them from microscopy images in 3D is an unresolved problem. In this article, AxonTracker-3D, an interactive 3D axon tracking and labeling tool is built to obtain quantitative information by reconstruction of the axonal structures in the entire innervation field. The ease of use along with accuracy of results makes AxonTracker-3D an attractive tool to obtain valuable quantitative information from axon datasets.Availability: The software is freely available for download at http://www.cbi-tmhs.org/AxonTracker/ Contact: stwong@tmhs.org},

abstract = {With recent advances in fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques and methods of gene knock down by RNA interference (RNAi), genome-scale high-content screening (HCS) has emerged as a powerful approach to systematically identify all parts of complex biological processes. However, a critical barrier preventing fulfillment of the success is the lack of efficient and robust methods for automating RNAi image analysis and quantitative evaluation of the gene knock down effects on huge volume of HCS data. Facing such opportunities and challenges, we have started investigation of automatic methods towards the development of a fully automatic RNAi-HCS system. Particularly important are reliable approaches to cellular phenotype classification and image-based gene function estimation. We have developed a HCS analysis platform that consists of two main components: fluorescence image analysis and image scoring. For image analysis, we used a two-step enhanced watershed method to extract cellular boundaries from HCS images. Segmented cells were classified into several predefined phenotypes based on morphological and appearance features. Using statistical characteristics of the identified phenotypes as a quantitative description of the image, a score is generated that reflects gene function. Our scoring model integrates fuzzy gene class estimation and single regression models. The final functional score of an image was derived using the weighted combination of the inference from several support vector-based regression models. We validated our phenotype classification method and scoring system on our cellular phenotype and gene database with expert ground truth labeling. We built a database of high-content, 3-channel, fluorescence microscopy images of Drosophila Kc"1"6"7 cultured cells that were treated with RNAi to perturb gene function. The proposed informatics system for microscopy image analysis is tested on this database. Both of the two main components, automated phenotype classification and image scoring system, were evaluated. The robustness and efficiency of our system were validated in quantitatively predicting the biological relevance of genes.},

Our goal is to align the sub-volumes by estimating a set of optimal global transformations that preserve morphological continuity of medical structures, e.g., blood vessels, in the reconstructed 3D volume. We approach the problem by learning morphological characteristics of structures of interest in each sub-volume to understand global alignment transformations. Based on the observations of morphology, sub-volumes are aligned by connecting the morphological features at the sub-volume boundaries by minimizing morphological discontinuity. To minimize the discontinuity, we introduce three morphological discontinuity metrics: discontinuity magnitude at sub-volume boundary points, and overall and junction discontinuity residuals after polynomial curve fitting to multiple aligned sub-volumes. The proposed techniques have been applied to the problem of aligning CLSM sub-volumes acquired from four consecutive physical cross sections. Our experimental results demonstrated significant improvements of morphological smoothness of medical structures in comparison with the results obtained by naive feature matching followed by volume transformation at the sub-volume boundaries. The experimental results were evaluated by visual inspection and by quantifying morphological discontinuity metrics.},

The presented semiautomatic method is designed based on our observations that (a) an accurate point selection is much harder than an accurate region (segment) selection for a human, (b) a centroid selection of any region is less accurate by a human than by a computer, and (c) registration based on structural shape of a region rather than based on intensity-defined point is more robust to noise and to morphological deformation of features across stacks. We applied the method to image mosaicking and image alignment registration steps and evaluated its performance with 20 human subjects on CLSM images with stained blood vessels. Our experimental evaluation showed significant benefits of automation for 3D volume reconstruction in terms of achieved accuracy, consistency of results, and performance time. In addition, the results indicate that the differences between registration accuracy obtained by experts and by novices disappear with the proposed semiautomatic registration technique while the absolute registration accuracy increases.},

Finally, Bayesian and support vector machine-based classifiers are trained and validated with 100 cases and 100 control subjects. In effect, it is hereby observed that the significant textural features lead to discriminate P. vivax with 95% and 98% accuracies for SVM and Bayesian classifiers respectively.

This is particularly true for multi-channel data sets, where multiple data values exist for each voxel, which require multi-dimensional transfer functions. In this article, we propose a new method for multi-dimensional transfer function design. Our new method provides a framework to combine multiple computational approaches and pushes the boundary of gradient-based multidimensional transfer functions to multiple channels, while keeping the dimensionality of transfer functions at a manageable level, that is, a maximum of three dimensions, which can be displayed visually in a straightforward way. Our approach utilizes channel intensity, gradient, curvature and texture properties of each voxel. Applying recently developed nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms reduce the high-dimensional data of the domain. In this article, we use Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding as well as a traditional algorithm, Principle Component Analysis. Our results show that these dimensionality reduction algorithms significantly improve the transfer function design process without compromising visualization accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new dimensionality reduction algorithms with two volumetric confocal microscopy data sets.},

The proposed scheme is composed of collagen fibres segmentation, its textural feature extraction and selection, screening perfomance enhancement under Gaussian transformation and finally classification. In this study, collagen fibres are segmented on R,G,B color channels using back-probagation neural network from 60 normal and 59 OSF histological images followed by histogram specification for reducing the stain intensity variation. Henceforth, textural features of collgen area are extracted using fractal approaches viz., differential box counting and brownian motion curve . Feature selection is done using Kullback---Leibler  ( KL) divergence criterion and the screening performance is evaluated based on various statistical tests to conform Gaussian nature. Here, the screening performance is enhanced under Gaussian transformation of the non-Gaussian features using hybrid distribution. Moreover, the routine screening is designed based on two statistical classifiers viz., Bayesian classification and support vector machines (SVM) to classify normal and OSF. It is observed that SVM with linear kernel function provides better classification accuracy (91.64%) as compared to Bayesian classifier. The addition of fractal features of collagen under Gaussian transformation improves Bayesian classifier's performance from 80.69% to 90.75%. Results are here studied and discussed.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an automatic classification system for the use in prostate cancer diagnosis. The system aims to detect and classify prostatic tissue textures captured from microscopic samples taken from needle biopsies. Biopsies are usually analyzed by a trained pathologist with different grades of malignancy typically corresponding to different structural patterns as well as apparent textures. In the context of prostate cancer diagnosis, four major groups have to be accurately recognized: stroma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostatic carcinoma. Recently, multispectral imagery has been proposed as a new image acquisition modality which unlike conventional RGB-based light microscopy allows the acquisition of a large number of spectral bands within the visible spectrum, resulting in a large feature vector size. Many features in the initial feature set are irrelevant to the classification task and are correlated with each other, resulting in an increase in the computational complexity and a reduction in the recognition rate. In this paper, a Round-Robin (RR) sequential forward selection RR-SFS is used to address these problems. RR is a technique for handling multi-class problems with binary classifiers by training one classifier for each pair of classes. The experimental results demonstrate this finding when compared with classical method based on the multiclass SFS and other ensemble methods such as bagging/boosting with decision tree (C4.5) classifier where it is shown that RR-SFS method achieves the best results with a classification accuracy of 99.9%.},

abstract = {Quantitative cell imagery in cancer pathology has progressed greatly in the last 25 years. The application areas are mainly those in which the diagnosis is still critically reliant upon the analysis of biopsy samples, which remains the only conclusive method for making an accurate diagnosis of the disease. Biopsies are usually analyzed by a trained pathologist who, by analyzing the biopsies under a microscope, assesses the normality or malignancy of the samples submitted. Different grades of malignancy correspond to different structural patterns as well as to apparent textures. In the case of prostate cancer, four major groups have to be recognized: stroma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostatic carcinoma. Recently, multispectral imagery has been used to solve this multiclass problem. Unlike conventional RGB color space, multispectral images allow the acquisition of a large number of spectral bands within the visible spectrum, resulting in a large feature vector size. For such a high dimensionality, pattern recognition techniques suffer from the well-known "curse-of-dimensionality" problem. This paper proposes a novel round-robin tabu search (RR-TS) algorithm to address the curse-of-dimensionality for this multiclass problem. The experiments have been carried out on a number of prostate cancer textured multispectral images, and the results obtained have been assessed and compared with previously reported works. The system achieved 98%-100% classification accuracy when testing on two datasets. It outperformed principal component/linear discriminant classifier (PCA-LDA), tabu search/nearest neighbor classifier (TS-1NN), and bagging/boosting with decision tree (C4.5) classifier},

In this research, with the aim of applying it to head-disk interface of hard disk drives, we propose a method based on diffraction simulations that enables thickness measurement of molecularly thin films coated on grooved solid surfaces. Using this method, we experimentally investigate the spreading characteristics of nanometer-thick polymeric liquid lubricant films on grooved surfaces. The results revealed that the average thicknesses of the films dip-coated on the grooved and smooth surfaces under identical conditions were approximately the same, whereas lubricant spreading on grooved surfaces was significantly faster than that on smooth surfaces.},

abstract = {We review the results of synthesis of well-aligned IrO2 nanocrystals (NCs) on sapphire (SA), LiNbO3 (LNO), LiTaO3 (LTO) substrates via reactive magnetron sputtering and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The surface morphology and structural properties of the as-deposited NCs were characterized. Field emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs reveal that NCs grown on SA(100)/LNO(100) are vertically aligned, while the NCs on SA(012)/LTO(012) and SA(110) contain singly and doubly tilted alignments, respectively, with a tilt angle of ∼ 35° from the normal to the substrates. NCs grown on SA(001) show in-plane alignment with mosaic structure. The X-ray diffraction results indicate that the NCs are (001), (101), and (100) oriented on SA(100)/LNO(100), SA(012)/LTO(012)/SA(110), and SA(001) substrates, respectively. A strong substrate effect on the alignment of the IrO2 NCs deposition has been demonstrated. The roles of different substrates in the formation of various textures of nanocrystalline IrO2 are studied and the possible mechanisms have been discussed.},

abstract = {Virtual Histology-Intravascular Ultrasound (VH-IVUS) is widely used for studying atherosclerosis plaque composition. However, one of the main limitations of the VH-IVUS relates to its dependence to the Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a robust image-based approach for characterization of the plaques using IVUS images. The proposed method consists of three main steps of (1) shadow detection: as an efficient preprocessing step to identify and remove acoustic shadow regions; (2) feature extraction: a combination of gray-scale based features and textural descriptors; and (3) classification: to classify each pixel into one of the three classes (calcium, necrotic core and fibro-fatty). In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm two in-vivo and ex-vivo data sets are considered. The kappa values of 0.639 on in-vivo and 0.628 on ex-vivo tests with VH-IVUS and the histology images labeled by the experts respectively indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

This article reviews research aimed at establishing and investigating universal, scalable manufacturing techniques for materials and structures with stochastic tree architectures, and custom-designed, controlled probabilistic leafage, branch and trunk features. These are achieved by combination of complementary, multiscale fabrication processes for robust, affordable, productive manufacture, such as ultrasonic corrosion texturing, ultrasonic powder consolidation, block copolymer self-assembly, plasma processing of polymers, fiber electrospinning, anodized alumina templating and carbon nano-network deposition. Their process-structure-property relations are studied by microscopic, spectroscopic and other experimentation, coupled with computation via atomistic and continuum simulations. Such modelling will enable design and optimization, as well as real-time identification and process control. Manufacturing synthesis of such processes is illustrated in research related to nanoheaters, nanocomposite foils and tissue scaffolds. The platform illustrates and exemplifies some of the key salient features of nanomanufacturing for scalable production.

The effects of inserting a thin gold (Au) layer between the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and the poly 2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyl-oxy)-p-phenylenevinylene (MEH-PPV) organic material on the electrical and interface state properties of a ITO/MEH-PPV/Al device are investigated through current-voltage I(V), and capacitance-voltage characteristics C(V). The modified anode was characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM), and UV-vis transmittance spectra. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface roughness analysis indicates that a uniform and smoother surface is formed when the ITO is covered by the Au interlayer. A decrease in the transmittance and the optical band gap is observed in ITO/Au anode. The ITO/Au/MEH-PPV/Al device shows improved current density-voltage characteristics as compared with the ITO/MEH-PPV/Al. Diode parameters such as ideality factor, barrier height, series resistance and Shunt resistance are calculated using Schottky model corrected from the series and Shunt resistances. In the presence of the Au interlayer, the junction resistance across the ITO/MEH-PPV interface is significantly reduced, leading to an improvement in hole injection.The interface state density (Nss) values and the time constant of the interface states ( ) are obtained by the development of a new approach by the fit of the capacitance with three capacitances in series, according to Nicollian and Goetzberger formula. A decrease in the interface state density is observed when the Au interlayer is introduced at the ITO/organic layer interface. The main factors contributing to such improvements induced by the thin gold buffer layer are discussed.},

abstract = {The process of pattern transfer of desired topological integrated circuits features into silicon or other semiconductor compounds plays a critical role for the production of microelectronic and photonic devices, and micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems. Any deviation from the desired shape of the pattern limits density, yield, and reliability of these devices. Gas reactivity, pressure, ion, electron, and reactant transport to the surface, and product transport away from the surface, have been identified as important issues that control the microscopic uniformity in high aspect ratio etching. A plasma etching simulation software, containing corresponding physical models, can be used to establish a link between etch process parameters such as pressure, rf power, etching gas chemistry, temperature, and the physical and chemical process parameters like energy and angular distribution of ions and neutrals, radical sticking, and surface charging. ViPER (Virtual Plasma Etch Reactor) is a full featured plasma processing simulation software developed at Ilmenau University of Technology, Department of Microelectronic and Nanoelectronic Systems (MNES) [ http://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/mne-mns/research/plasma-etching/viper-download ]. The simulator allows a deep analysis of the most significant effects like reactive ion etching lag, charging, notching, bowing, faceting, microtrenching, profile shape dependence, and gives more insight into the physical phenomena occurring in the plasma reactor during plasma etching process, helping engineers to understand how plasma etching works.},

abstract = {BackgroundOvaSpec is a new, fully automated, vision-based instrument for assessing the quantity (concentration) and quality (embryonation percentage) of Trichuris suis parasite eggs in liquid suspension. The eggs constitute the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a medicinal drug for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases such as Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis, and multiple sclerosis. MethodsThis paper describes the development of an automated microscopy technology, including methodological challenges and design decisions of relevance for the future development of comparable vision-based instruments. Morphological properties are used to distinguish eggs from impurities and two features of the egg contents under brightfield and darkfield illumination are used in a statistical classification to distinguish eggs with undifferentiated contents (non-embryonated eggs) from eggs with fully developed larvae inside (embryonated eggs). ResultsFor assessment of the instrument s performance, six egg suspensions of varying quality were used to generate a dataset of unseen images. Subsequently, annotation of the detected eggs and impurities revealed a high agreement with the manual, image-based assessments for both concentration and embryonation percentage (both error rates &lt;1.0%). Similarly, a strong correlation was demonstrated in a final, blinded comparison with traditional microscopic assessments performed by an experienced laboratory technician. ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates the applicability of computer vision in the production, analysis, and quality control of T. suis eggs used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. A scalable, objective method for in-process drug testing was developed.OvaSpec automatically assess concentration and embryonation percentage of TSO.Algorithms were tested on a large, annotated dataset of 42,894 eggs in 2970 images.Darkfield scattering and larval morphology enables classification accuracies of 99%.Computer vision agrees with manual microscopy but has superior precision.},

abstract = {The energy deposition during the wire electrical explosion process plays an important role in the expansion of metallic vapor and conductive plasma for the nanopowders preparation. In this paper, aluminum nanopowders are synthesized by electrical exploding aluminum wire in the argon gas under different charging voltages of the capacitor. The influence of the deposited energy E and the argon gas pressure p on the characteristics of aluminum nanopowders is studied by the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Due to the effect of argon gas pressure on the energy deposition, a plasma expansion parameter $Ep^{-1}$ is proposed to summarize the synthesis conditions. The results show that the morphology of aluminum nanopowders was mainly dependent on the argon gas pressure rather than deposited energy. Lower deposited energy and higher pressure of argon gas could broaden the particle size distribution range of aluminum nanopowders evidently, which is ascribed to a smaller plasma expansion volume. The count mean diameter of aluminum nanopowders decreases monotonically with the increasing plasma expansion parameter $Ep^{-1}$. The value of relative standard deviation ranges from 0.38 to 0.5 in the experiments. It has been demonstrated that the size uniformity of nanoparticles can be improved by reducing the energy deposition rate when the pressure of argon gas and deposited energy remains virtually unchanged.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to automatic detection of the erythemato-squamous diseases based on fuzzy extreme learning machine (FELM). Enormous computational efforts are required to classify these erythemato-squamous diseases. Some of the approaches performed previously are through fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy models. FELM-based differential diagnosis of these diseases involves decisions made by fuzzy logic and extreme learning machine (ELM) with greater efficiency in both time and accuracy. In this paper, we develop a user-friendly interface and this tool will be useful for a dermatologist to estimate the six types of erythemato-squamous diseases with the help of patient's histopathological and clinical data. Then, the developed interface is derived inbuilt using neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and FELM. A dataset containing records of 366 patients with 34 features that define six disease characteristics was taken, of which 310 records were used as training data and 56 other records used as testing data. The dataset was preprocessed to obtain fuzzy values as input to get more accurate results in FELM. Given a training set of such records, ELM approach is applied. By combining fuzzy logic and ELM, more accurate results with increased performance are obtained with less computational efforts. Finally, the proposed FELM model proves to be a potential solution for the diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases with significant improvement in computational time and accuracy compared with other models discussed in the recent literature.},

abstract = {Medical experts and pathologists studies on cells to examine the effects on cell activities due to external factors. In order to observe the live cell activity over a long period of time, new imaging techniques such as differential interference contrast microscopy have been deployed to overcome the shortcomings of transparent cells under the conventional microscopy. A normal healthy cell regulates the mitosis process (cell splitting) to prevent over growing. Abnormal cell cycle pattern may provide an important clue to disease or mutation, for example, cancerous cells expand uncontrollably with irregular mitosis process. In order to analyze the cell patterns, it is important to identify different stages in a cell cycle, and such process often requires human interactions. In this paper, proposed an automatic cell cycle phase detection process by analyzing the variations in the shapes and sizes of cells in the life cycle. We first adopted the geodesic active contour segmentation algorithm to extract the cells and by adjusting the initial contour for the GAC process, we can speed up the segmentation process almost half of the original processing time. By analyzing the deformation features such as the cell area and strain of the cell contours deforming over long period of time, we established the behaviors and the states of cells. Our results have demonstrated that the strain analysis of the cell deformation can detect the interphase and mitosis phase in cell cycle, and by analyzing the changes in cell area during mitosis phase, cytokinesis can be identified.},

This technique is applied to a gray level Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, segmented and converted in Black and White (B/W) images using the Trainable Segmentation plugin of Fiji. Resulting images are processed using a novel Matlab script composed of three different algorithms: the separation algorithm, the filtering and quantification algorithm and the orientation one. Initially the input image is enhanced via 5 morphological processes. The resulting lattice is "cut" into single cracks using 1 pixel-wide bisector lines originated from every node. Cracks are labeled using the connected-component method, then the script computes geometrical parameters, such as width, length, area, aspect ratio and orientation. A filtering is performed using a user-defined value of aspect ratio, followed by a statistical analysis of remaining cracks. In the last part of this paper we discuss about the efficiency of this script, introducing an example of analysis of two datasets with different dimension and resolution; these analyses are performed using a notebook and a high-end professional desktop solution, in order to simulate different working environments. A new methodology for the analysis of cracks from SEM images is proposed.The analysis is performed individually on every crack.The proposed separation algorithm minimize the loss of information.Computed geometrical descriptors are more accurate compared to previous solutions.},

The dependence of capacitance-voltage (C^-^2-V) for the device CoMTPP/p-Si was found to be almost linear which indicates that the junction behavior is abrupt nature and then the essential junction parameters were obtained.

abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of microscopic traffic, weather, and roadway geometric factors on the occurrence of specific crash types for a freeway. The I-70 Freeway was chosen for this paper since automatic vehicle identification (AVI) and weather detection systems are implemented along this corridor. A main objective of this paper is to expand the purpose of the existing intelligent transportation system to incorporate traffic safety improvement and suggest active traffic management (ATM) strategies by identifying the real-time crash patterns. Crashes have been categorized as rear-end, sideswipe, and single-vehicle crashes. AVI segment average speed, real-time weather data, and roadway geometric characteristic data were utilized as explanatory variables in this paper. First, binary logistic regression models were estimated to compare single- with multivehicle crashes and sideswipe with rear-end crashes. Then, a hierarchical logistic regression model that simultaneously fits two conditional logistic regression models for the three crash types has been developed. Results from the models indicate that single-vehicle crashes are more likely to occur in snowy seasons, at moderate slopes, three-lane segments, and under free-flow conditions, whereas the sideswipe crash occurrence differs from rear-end crashes with the visibility situation, segment number of lanes, grades, and their directions (up or down). Furthermore, the innovative way of estimating two conditional logistic regression models simultaneously in the Bayesian framework fits the correlated data structure well. Conclusions from this paper imply that different ATM strategies should be designed for three- and two-lane roadway sections and are also considering the seasonal effects.},

abstract = {The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is widely used for image description and proves to be very effective. In many vision problems, rotation-invariant analysis is necessary or preferred. Popular solutions are mainly based on pose normalization or learning, neglecting some intrinsic properties of rotations. This paper presents a method to build rotation-invariant HOG descriptors using Fourier analysis in polar/spherical coordinates, which are closely related to the irreducible representation of the 2D/3D rotation groups. This is achieved by considering a gradient histogram as a continuous angular signal which can be well represented by the Fourier basis (2D) or spherical harmonics (3D). As rotation-invariance is established in an analytical way, we can avoid discretization artifacts and create a continuous mapping from the image to the feature space. In the experiments, we first show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in a public dataset for a car detection task in aerial images. We further use the Princeton Shape Benchmark and the SHREC 2009 Generic Shape Benchmark to demonstrate the high performance of our method for similarity measures of 3D shapes. Finally, we show an application on microscopic volumetric data.},

abstract = {Silver -coated gold bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized and used as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in detecting prohibited triphenylmethane drugs (including crystal violet and malachite green) in fish muscle. The optical properties and physical properties of bimetallic nanospheres were characterized by UV-V is spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The optimal nanospheres selected had relatively uniform size (diameter: 33 ± 3 nm) with a silver layer coated on the surface of gold seed (diameter: 18 ± 2 nm). For both crystal violet and malachite green, characteristic SERS spectral features could be identified at concentration as low as 0.1 µg/L with these bimetallic nanospheres. Crystal violet and malachite green residues in fish muscle could also be detected at levels as low as 0.1 ng/g, which could meet the most restricted regulatory requirements for the limit of detection in terms of analytical methods for crystal violet or malachite green in fish muscle. This study provides a basis for applying SERS technology with bimetallic nanoparticles to the identification of trace amounts of prohibited substances in aquatic food products, and the methodology could be extended to analyses of other hazardous chemicals in complex food matrices like vegetables and meats.},

abstract = {Iron oxides that exhibit magnetic properties have been widely studied not only from an academic standpoint, but also for numerous applications in different fields of knowledge, such as biomedical and technological research. In this work, magnetite and maghemite nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical coprecipitation of FeCl2undefined4H2O and FeCl3undefined6H2O (proportion of 1 : 2) in three different cases using two bases (sodium hydroxide and hydroxide ammonium) as precipitants. The chemical coprecipitation method was selected for its simplicity, convenience, reproducibility, and low cost in the use of glassware. The nanostructured materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and magnetometry (VSM). The objective of this work is to study the variation in the morphological characteristics and physical properties of nanoparticles magnetic as a function of the different production processes. As observed by TEM, the materials obtained from the precipitating agent NH4OH are more uniform than those obtained with NaOH. From XRD pattern analysis, it appears that the obtained materials correspond to magnetite and maghemite and, from magnetometry VSM analysis, show high magnetization as a function of the magnetic field at room temperature, indicating that these materials are superparamagnetic.},

The cell parameter a decreases for YbxSb2-xTe3 compounds upon increasing the dopant content (x), while c increases. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images show that doping of Yb3+ ions in the lattice of Sb2Te3 produces different morphology. The electrical conductivity of Yb-doped Sb2Te3 is higher than the pure Sb2Te3 and increases with temperature. By increasing concentration of the Yb3+ ions, the absorption spectrum of Sb2Te3 shows red shifts and some intensity changes. In addition to the characteristic red emission peaks of Sb2Te3, emission spectra of doped materials show other emission bands originating from f-f transitions of the Yb3+ ions.

Medpor was punched into circular shape and dipped into the chitosan gel solution. The Medpor plates soaked with chitosan were identified by the SEM images. We evaluated the growth rate of MC3T3-E1 cell using Von Kossa staining and MTT assay as in vitro experiment. And we implanted both Medpor plates into skull of domestic rabbits for in vivo experiment. We evaluated the osseointegration result with an optical microscope in postoperative 3 weeks and 6 weeks histologically. Results. The in vitro MC3T3-E1 cell growth rate on Medpor soaking with chitosan was faster than the original one in both Von Kossa staining and MTT assay. In animal test, Medpor soaking with chitosan shows more pronounced new bone than original Medpor too. Conclusion. Medpor soaking with chitosan was a successful modification. It is believed that the upgraded osseointegration ability of Medpor soaking with chitosan gives many benefits to clinicians using a Medpor implant for oral and maxillofacial reconstruction surgery.},

The influence of sputter deposition time on the properties of the AlN films was studied. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscope. Dielectric properties of the film were investigated using impedance analyzer. XRD measurements showed the presence of hexagonal wurtzite structure. The crystal orientation of the AlN films changed from (100) to (002) with increase in deposition time. The peak found in FTIR spectra was attributed to A"1 (To) phonon modes. The morphology of the film improved with the increase in deposition time. MIS capacitors were fabricated on n type silicon substrates, and the dependence of dielectric parameters with deposition time was investigated. Dielectric constants of 6.0-6.8 were obtained at 1MHz. Response of AlN/Si films of different thicknesses, with Al and Pd catalytic over layers, was investigated for 50ppm hydrogen. Pd/AlN/Si device fabricated with 114nm layer of AlN revealed an enhanced response in the C-V characteristics, while Al/AlN/Si device did not show any effect, indicating that the hydrogen sensitivity is highly dependent on the gate outer surface and deposition time.},

abstract = {Material surface topography is an important factor for regulating cellular behaviour. Understanding the mechanism of how surface topography influences mammalian cells is critical for the development of medical implants and tissue engineering. In this study, we investigated the influences of nanoporous and microgrooved substrates on the morphology and migration of hepatic cell line, BEL-7402 cells. Cells were cultured on nanoporous (140nm in diameter) anodized alumina membrane (AAM), nanoporous (140nm in diameter) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and microgrooves (10@mm, 30@mm, and 50@mm in width, and 2@mm in depth) patterned PDMS, then imaged by fluorescent microscopy, time-lapse microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell morphology and migration were investigated through image analysis. The results suggest that the nanoporous and microgrooved surface structure induced totally different changes on BEL-7402 cells. Compared to the well-spread cells on the flat surface plate, the cells formed spheroids on the nanoporous AAM surface and nanoporous PDMS surface with no elongation and alignment, while the cells grew with elongated and aligned morphology along the microgrooves on the PDMS substrates. The BEL-7402 cell migration speed was significantly higher on the nanoporous substrates than on the flat surfaces. On the microgrooved PDMS substrates, the cells migrated along the groove direction and showed relatively small difference of the overall velocity compared to the cells on the flat PDMS surface. Our findings provide insights into the control of cell morphological features and migratory behaviour by using artificial nanoporous or microgrooved substrates, which can benefit the research on hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis, tissue engineering, and medical implant design.},

abstract = {Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted Highlights CdS QDs smaller than 6nm diameter were produced by soft chemistry methods. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry technique is applied to QDs for size determination. MALDI-TOF MS and TEM techniques are complementary tools for nanometrology. With the development of material sciences, the characterization of nanomaterials has become a critical issue in managing their fascinating size-dependent physical and chemical properties. Controlling these properties from synthesis to the application phase, and consequently to their fate as a worldwide environmental and societal concern, is becoming more and more necessary. In this context, nanometrology, seen as a step to the total control of quantum dot (QD) properties, should make real headway in the near future. From this perspective, we present a careful investigation of small (&lt;6nm) CdS QDs synthesized either by a thermal growth process or in a microwave oven, using organometallic precursors. We will show that mass spectrometry (MS) is a worthwhile alternative to traditional solid state methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for QD diameter measurements. Indeed, low ionization technique such as Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization coupled to Time Of Flight (MALDI-TOF) analyser overcomes the propensity of large molecules to fragment when severely ionized. Moreover, MS can confirm TEM direct geometric observations. Combined with TEM, it provides a reliable determination of the shape-related correcting factor as a fit parameter, improving the consistent results for QD diameters obtained from both techniques. Consequently, MALDI-TOF MS is suitable for nanomaterial analyses and, when combined with physical methods, brings new insight to the analysis of chemical composition, structure, and stability and gives another potential tool for the accurate metrology of QDs.},

abstract = {In last decade, polymeric gears have found wide applications in industrial fields. This is due to their advantages like noise reduction, self-lubricating features, weight reduction, cost savings as well as lower tribological characteristics in term of friction and wear. The main objective of this paper is to study the wear behavior of spur gears that makes polymer blended by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (acetal). This was made by using appropriate adhesive oil (Paraffin) during injection moulding practice to produce thick flanges with diameter 134&nbsp;mm and thickness 29&nbsp;mm. The CNTs were produced by a fully automatic system using arc-discharge technique multielectrodes. The synthesizing CNT/acetal flanges contain 1% CNTs by weight. The flanges were machined using CNC milling machine to produce spur gears. The dispersion of CNTs in polymer were examined by scanning electron microscope. The experiments were performed at a running speed of 1420&nbsp;r/min and at torques of 13 and 16&nbsp;N·m. In addition, the mechanical properties of CNT/acetal have been tested. The results showed that the wear resistances of the CNTs/acetal spur gears increased with the addition of CNT. The strength, Young's modulus and stiffness also increased while the hardness was not affected by the addition of CNT.},

abstract = {With the development of micron-scale imaging techniques, capillaries can be conveniently visualized using methods such as two-photon and whole mount microscopy. However, the presence of background staining, leaky vessels and the diffusion of small fluorescent molecules can lead to significant complexity in image analysis and loss of information necessary to accurately quantify vascular metrics. One solution to this problem is the development of accurate thresholding algorithms that reliably distinguish blood vessels from surrounding tissue. Although various thresholding algorithms have been proposed, our results suggest that without appropriate pre- or post-processing, the existing approaches may fail to obtain satisfactory results for capillary images that include areas of contamination. In this study, we propose a novel local thresholding algorithm, called directional histogram ratio at random probes (DHR-RP). This method explicitly considers the geometric features of tube-like objects in conducting image binarization, and has a reliable performance in distinguishing small vessels from either clean or contaminated background. Experimental and simulation studies suggest that our DHR-RP algorithm is superior over existing thresholding methods.},

abstract = {Wide band gap semiconducting layers of undoped and Ni-doped p-type ZnO thin films were developed on (100) silicon substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at a constant oxygen partial pressure of 1.0x10^-^4 Torr and at constant temperature of 250^oC. The electrical properties of the films were studied by resistivity and Hall coefficient measurements at room temperature. P-type conductivity was found to be dominant in these films at room temperature although the incorporation of Ni dopants caused a reduction in the p-character of ZnO films. The surface morphology of the films was evaluated by contact mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) in air. Cr-Schottky contacts were deposited on these p-type ZnO films, and the rectifying properties of the contacts were evaluated. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the Cr/ZnO Schottky diodes were measured at room temperature. Due to series resistance, the Cheung and Cheung functions were used to determine the barrier height and ideality factor of the diodes while Norde function was used to determine barrier height. Ideality factors of 1.07 and 1.22 were obtained for the Cr/undoped ZnO and Cr/Ni-doped ZnO diodes, respectively, while the barrier height was 0.59eV by the Norde model, and in good agreement with 0.62eV of the Cheung-Cheung model, for both undoped and Ni-doped samples.},

abstract = {Many anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates were traditionally performed by potentiostatic anodization at 0---10 °C to inhibit the Joule's heat enhanced dissolution in aluminum oxide for ordered AAO configuration. In this article, the hybrid pulse anodization has been performed for offering the effective suppression of Joule's heat generation in high-aspect-ratio AAO formation at room temperature. The effect of pulse period, duty ratio, potential and electrolytic concentration on the evolution of pore characteristics was investigated using Taguchi method. The AAO morphology was captured by scanning electron microscope, and analyzed by gray-scale imaging in order to identify the pore size distribution and AAO thickness for Taguchi analysis. Short pulse-off period and low current density improved the uniformity of pore distribution. Moreover, high current density and intermediate pulse period/duty ratio can enhance the reaction rate and resulted in thick AAO. The evolution of AAO configuration and thickness were further correlated and discussed with pulse modulations and electrolytic concentrations.},

abstract = {Hydrophobic powders were obtained via surface modification of silica or magnesium silicate with selected silanes. A modified precipitation method, carried out in an emulsion system, was used for monodisperse silica synthesis, while magnesium silicate was precipitated in a traditional water system. Functionalization of the obtained inorganic supports was performed with selected alkylsilanes: one newly synthesized, 3-(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoropentyloxy)propyltriethoxysilane (OPF), and two commercial, octadecylsilane (ODS) and octyltriethoxysilane C14H32O3Si (OCS), in amounts of 3, 5, or 10 weight parts by mass of SiO2. It was determined how the chemical modification of the silica or magnesium silicate surface affected its physicochemical properties. The dispersive characteristics of both unmodified and functionalized silica-based systems were evaluated. The morphology and microstructure of the samples obtained were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. The parameters of porous structure of the prepared systems were evaluated on the basis of BET equation as well as nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. Wettability tests as well as elemental analysis of the obtained inorganic oxide hybrids were also performed. In order to verify the effectiveness of silica and magnesium silicate surface functionalization with selected silanes, FTIR spectra were investigated. The resulting experimental data allowed calculation of the degree of coverage of the silica-based systems with modifying agents.},

abstract = {A novel bulk synthesis method for preparing high pure Ti3Al nanoparticles was developed by flow-levitation method (FL). The Ti and Al vapours ascending from the high temperature levitated droplet were condensed by cryogenic Ar gas under atmospheric pressure. The morphology, crystalline structure, and chemical composition of Ti3Al nanoparticles were, respectively, investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The results indicated that the Ti3Al powders are nearly spherical-shaped, and the particle size ranges from several nanometers to 100nm in diameter. Measurements of the d-spacing from X-ray (XRD) and electron diffraction studies confirmed that the Ti3Al nanoparticles have a hexagonal structure. A thin oxidation coating of 2-3 nm in thickness was formed around the particles after exposure to air. Based on the XPS measurements, the surface coating of the Ti3Al nanoparticles is a mixture of Al2O3 and TiO2. The production rate of Ti3Al nanoparticles was estimated to be about 3 g/h. This method has a great potential in mass production of Ti3Al nanoparticles.},

TiO2 films loaded with Pt nanoparticles were used as conductometric sensors for the detection of H2. The gas sensing of H2 was studied at the operating temperatures of 300, 350, and 400°C in dry air. It was found that 2.00 mol% Ptloaded TiO2 sensing films showed higher response towards H2 gas than the unloaded film. In addition, the responses of Pt-loaded TiO2 films at all operating temperatures were higher than that of unloaded TiO2 film. The response increased and the response time decreased with increasing of H2 concentrations.},

The BN-D-GF was incorporated into epoxy resin to construct "FRP nanocomposites." The morphology, dynamic mechanical and thermal characteristics of the FRP nanocomposites were analyzed. SEM morphology revealed that BN-D-GF heterogeneous dispersed in epoxy matrix. There was good adhesion between the polymer matrix and the BN-D-GF filler. The dynamic modulus and mechanical loss were studied using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Compared with neat epoxy and untreatedGF reinforced composites, BN-D-GF/epoxy and D-GF/epoxy systems showed improvedmechanical properties.

The methods adopted and the nonionic surfactant used in the synthesis of calcium carbonate nanocrystalline aragonite polymorphs were environmentally friendly and can be scaled up for industrial production.

FT-IR and FTRaman spectroscopy revealed the presence of the various vibrational modes corresponding to phosphates and hydroxyl groups and the absence of any band characteristic to silver.

Firstly, HZC films with different morphologies were deposited on aluminum substrates through immersing the aluminum substrates perpendicularly into aqueous solution containing zinc nitrate hexahydrate and urea. Secondly, the films were then modified with fluoroalkylsilane (FAS: CH3(CF2)6(CH2)3Si(OCH3)3) molecules by immersing in absolute ethanol solution containing FAS. Themorphologies, hydrophobicity, chemical compositions, and bonding states of the films were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle measurement (CA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. It was shown by surface morphological observation that HZC films displayed different microstructures such as microporous structure, rose petal-like structure, block-shaped structure, and pinecone-like structure by altering the deposition condition. A highest water contact angle of 156.2° was obtained after FAS modification. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of the superhydrophobic surface on aluminum substrate was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The EIS measurements' results revealed that the superhydrophobic surface considerably improved the corrosion resistance of aluminum.},

abstract = {Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy is a common approach for researching the dynamics of cell behaviors. Segmentation of shape of erythrocyte (red blood cell) is the basis of quantitative analysis of its deformability and hence its filterability. Commonly used manual segmentation of shapes of individual cells from samples by human visual inspection requires a large amount of tedious work because it is time consuming and exhaustive. This makes automatic cell image analysis essential in biology studies. In this paper, a novel level set based technique, called Complex Local Phase based Subjective Surfaces (CLAPSS), is proposed for the segmentation of differential interference contrast (DIC) red blood cell microscopy images. Based on the framework of a generalized version of subjective surfaces (GSUBSURF), a complex local phase based edge indicator function is introduced to replace the traditional gradient based edge detector for the local image feature acquisition, which is the key for the evolution of the surface. In addition, we propose a new variation scheme for stretching factor to achieve relatively accurate segmentation results even if the reference point is located nearby cell boundaries. We show that the proposed method is more accurate and reliable than several existing methods in experiments.},

Technological advances mean that it is now possible to digitise the slides so that they can be viewed on a computer, promising a number of benefits in terms of both efficiency and safety. Despite this, uptake of digital microscopy for diagnostic work has been slow, and research suggests scepticism and uncertainty amongst histopathologists. In order to design a successful digital microscope, one which fits with the work practices of histopathologists and which they are happy to use within their daily work, we have undertaken a workplace study of a histopathology department. In this paper, we present the findings of that study and discuss the implications of these findings for the design of a digital microscope.

abstract = {There is considerable recent progress in hair simulations, driven by the high demands in computer animated movies. However, capturing the complex interactions between hair and water is still relatively in its infancy. Such interactions are best modeled as those between water and an anisotropic permeable medium as water can flow into and out of the hair volume biased in hair fiber direction. Modeling the interaction is further challenged when the hair is allowed to move. In this paper, we introduce a simulation model that reproduces interactions between water and hair as a dynamic anisotropic permeable material. We utilize an Eulerian approach for capturing the microscopic porosity of hair and handle the wetting effects using a Cartesian bounding grid. A Lagrangian approach is used to simulate every single hair strand including interactions with each other, yielding fine-detailed dynamic hair simulation. Our model and simulation generate many interesting effects of interactions between fine-detailed dynamic hair and water, i.e., water absorption and diffusion, cohesion of wet hair strands, water flow within the hair volume, water dripping from the wet hair strands and morphological shape transformations of wet hair. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {In this study, a Pseudo three-dimensional Vision-based Nail-fold Morphological and Hemodynamic Analysis (PTVNMHA) is proposed to automatically extract morphological/hemodynamic features from a microscopic nail-fold image sequence, reconstruct the corresponding pseudo three-dimensional microvascular models, and visualize the dynamic blood flow in the model constructed. The morphological features extracted include the number, width/height, density, arteriolar limb caliber, curved segment caliber, venular limb caliber, blood color, tortuosity, and width of the curved segment of capillaries. The hemodynamic features identified are blood flow velocity and blood flow rate. All are significant pathological indicators with a spatial precision up to 1.6@mm. The diameters of cross-sections along the centerlines of capillaries are identified and employed to reconstruct the pseudo three-dimensional microvascular surface meshes. The microscopic image sequence acquired is mapped to the corresponding microvascular model constructed to perform dynamic blood flow visualization. Compared with laser Doppler velocimetry, PTVNMHA can derive blood flow velocities for each capillary across the microscopic range separately in much higher precision and obtain diversified morphological and hemodynamic features of capillaries with a low-cost equipment setup. In addition to the blood flow velocity, blood flow rate, which keeps almost constant no matter where the measuring position is in a capillary, has also been measured and proposed as a useful feature to discriminate patients with hypertension from the normal with great significance (p&lt;0.001). In the future, large scale experiments will be conducted to diagnose patients with anemia as well as patients with essential and secondary hypertension to verify effectiveness of the PTVNMHA system.},

abstract = {Highlights A system for semi-automatic processing of full-resolution whole-slide scans. A new algorithm for segmenting the nuclei under control of the expert user. Data storage and interaction of technical and medical experts is facilitated. Open source software with web-based architecture.. In order to automate cervical cancer screening tests, one of the most important and longstanding challenges is the segmentation of cell nuclei in the stained specimens. Though nuclei of isolated cells in high-quality acquisitions often are easy to segment, the problem lies in the segmentation of large numbers of nuclei with various characteristics under differing acquisition conditions in high-resolution scans of the complete microscope slides. We implemented a system that enables processing of full resolution images, and proposes a new algorithm for segmenting the nuclei under adequate control of the expert user. The system can work automatically or interactively guided, to allow for segmentation within the whole range of slide and image characteristics. It facilitates data storage and interaction of technical and medical experts, especially with its web-based architecture. The proposed algorithm localizes cell nuclei using a voting scheme and prior knowledge, before it determines the exact shape of the nuclei by means of an elastic segmentation algorithm. After noise removal with a mean-shift and a median filtering takes place, edges are extracted with a Canny edge detection algorithm. Motivated by the observation that cell nuclei are surrounded by cytoplasm and their shape is roughly elliptical, edges adjacent to the background are removed. A randomized Hough transform for ellipses finds candidate nuclei, which are then processed by a level set algorithm. The algorithm is tested and compared to other algorithms on a database containing 207 images acquired from two different microscope slides, with promising results.},

abstract = {Motivation:  The systematic observation of phenotypes has become a crucial tool of functional genomics, and several large international projects are currently underway to identify and characterize the phenotypes that are associated with genotypes in several species. To integrate phenotype descriptions within and across species, phenotype ontologies have been developed. Applying ontologies to unify phenotype descriptions in the domain of physiology has been a particular challenge due to the high complexity of the underlying domain.  Results:  In this study, we present the outline of a theory and its implementation for an ontology of physiology-related phenotypes. We provide a formal description of process attributes and relate them to the attributes of their temporal parts and participants. We apply our theory to create the Cellular Phenotype Ontology (CPO). The CPO is an ontology of morphological and physiological phenotypic characteristics of cells, cell components and cellular processes. Its prime application is to provide terms and uniform definition patterns for the annotation of cellular phenotypes. The CPO can be used for the annotation of observed abnormalities in domains, such as systems microscopy, in which cellular abnormalities are observed and for which no phenotype ontology has been created.  Availability and implementation:  The CPO and the source code we generated to create the CPO are freely available on http://cell-phenotype.googlecode.com.

abstract = {Background: The success of a tissue engineered construct is greatly influenced by the choice of scaffold material. Decellularized esophageal matrix is a promising material for esophageal tissue engineering. The aim of this study was to develop a decellularized ovine esophageal mucosa and to investigate the effect of decellularization on the appearance of the resulting tissue. Methods: Ovine esophagi were decellularized by combination of agitation, enzymatic digestion and treatment with 1 and 5% sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS. Efficiency of decellularization was assessed by histological examination and DNA quantification. Finally, the effect of decellularization on tissue morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Decellularization resulted in a highly efficient removal of cells and DNA content. Electron microscopic investigation revealed a denuded, rough, undulating surface with preserved papillary structures. Individual papillae had a length of approximately 55 μm and were present at a density of 1332 μm/mm^{2}. Closer examination revealed a tightly packed sponge-like appearance with pores in the region of 300 nm. Numerous, intact collagen fibres were also visible. Conclusion: Ovine esophagus can be successfully decellularized through treatment with SDS. The resulting decellularized mucosal surface possesses a rough, 2D surface with a well preserved extracellular matrix. Such a material may be of advantage in tissue engineering of the esophagus. Characterisation of the papillary layer gives important insight into the suitability of decellularized esophageal mucosa for use in esophageal reconstruction and also provides morphological information which may help in the design of synthetic, biomimetic materials.},

In the case of dinonyl phthalate, the characteristic pore sizes lie below 100 nm. The synthesized porous polymers can sorb both polar and nonpolar solvents.

abstract = {Novel software has been developed for the geometric characterisation of agrotextiles intended for installation in greenhouse vents as a means of crop protection. This characterisation of insect-proof screens is essential with a view to keeping insects out and also from an aerodynamic point of view. The method of analysis is based on digital images taken by microscope or scanner. The geometric procedure considers that each hole of the screen represents a quadrilateral, as it is defined by four threads of monofilament that cross over each other. The software developed using Visual Basic allows us to identify the coordinates of the vertices of the quadrilaterals and therefore to carry out a complete characterisation of the agrotextiles: number of threads per unit length, porosity of the sample, dimensions of the holes, thickness of the threads, area of the holes and the largest circle contained in the holes. The analysis of the data provided by the software allows us to study the uniformity of the material and also to detect flaws in its manufacture. The software includes a pattern for identifying the vertices with a high percentage of accuracy. For instance, it analysed over 40,000 vertices with only 1.14% error, mostly due to dirt on the screen. The software developed includes procedures to detect these errors, to alert the user to the type of error and to correct them. There is no other specific procedure to measure the characteristic dimensions of insect-proof screens and, therefore, it is no possible to contrast in this way the results that are obtained with the proposed method. Consequently, the measurement method has been verified using a set of screens of known dimensions manufactured for this very purpose. The results obtained are excellent, revealing that the differences between the expected values and the measured ones are well below the sensitivity of the device used to obtain the digital images.},

Here, we reported on using direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering for growing Ag nanoparticles on unheated substrates. Effects of sputtering condition on grain size of Ag nanoparticle were discussed. At constant sputtering current and deposition time, the average sizes of Ag nanoparticles were 5.9 ± 1.8, 5.4 ± 1.3, and 3.8 ± 0.7 nm for the target-substrate distances of 10, 15, and 20 cm, respectively. The morphology evolution from nanoparticles to wormlike networks was also reported. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy image represented clear lattice fringes of Ag nanoparticles with a d-spacing of 0.203 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane. The technique could be applied for growth of nanoparticles that were previously difficult to control over size and size uniformity.},

Nd:YAG laser, emitted the light at a wavelength of 1064 nm, was used as a light source. The laser ablation was carried out at different energies of 1, 3, and 5 J. The structure of ablated Al particles suspended in deionized water was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns revealed that the ablated Al particles transformed into γ-Al2O3. The morphology of nanoparticles was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The FE-SEM images showed that most of the nanoparticles obtained from all the ablated laser energies have spherical shape with a particle size of less than 100 nm. Furthermore, it was observed that the particle size increased with increasing the laser energy. The absorption spectra of Al2O3 nanoparticles suspended in deionized water were recorded at room temperature using UV-visible spectroscopy. The absorption spectra show a strong peak at 210nm arising from the presence of Al2O3 nanoparticles. The results on absorption spectra are in good agreement with those investigated by XRD which confirmed the formation of Al2O3 nanoparticles during the laser ablation of Al target in deionized water.},

Additionally, mesoporous materials were found to be formed at both pH 10 and 11 while they were unstable under more alkaline conditions. The adsorption/desorption isotherm results for the mesoporous materials synthesized at around pH 11 and with NaOH/SiO2 ratios of 0.5-0.8 showed a hysteresis loop characteristic of the bottle-neck pore shape. Furthermore, mesoporous materials with good physical properties were synthesized from all gels at pH 10 regardless of sodium concentration.},

to fuel/solar/battery cells to “nature-made nano-bio transistors” or ion channels which
effectively maintain ion concentrations within cells, the basic unit of structure and function in
all living things.  To appreciate the challenges associated with charge transport systems such as
those found in sophisticated nano devices (mechanical, optical, electronic, and biological), the
article underscores the importance of properly accounting for intricate molecular mechanisms,
sophisticated material structures, chemical reactions, and potentially large spatial dimensions when
these devices are embedded within large systems, e.g.,  fuel cells.The article then proceeds to develop variational multiscale models with a focus on addressing
heterogeneous chemical and biological systems that are far from equilibrium. Numerous examples are
discussed, including fuel cells, a host of nanofluidic devices, and in particular ion channels which
are used to validate the variational multiscale models.  Derivations are given for coupled
Laplace--Beltrami (LB) and Poisson--Nernst--Planck (PNP) equations as well as coupled
Laplace--Beltrami and Poisson--Boltzmann--Nernst--Planck (PBNP) equations and also Laplace--Beltrami
coupled with Poisson--Nernst--Planck and Navier--Stokes equations. The authors demonstrate two
important model features: (1) consistency between equilibrium LP and Poisson--Boltzmann theory and
nonequilibrium LP and PNP theory at equilibrium, and (2) how the reduced equations associated with
the LB and PBNP formulation can capture behavior obtained from the coupled LB-PNP equations in
nonequilibrium settings.  The differential geometry of surfaces as a means of separating macroscopic
and microscopic domains also plays a prominent role in the paper. The article concludes with
computational algorithms that implement the multiscale models and a number of interesting numerical
experiments which include comparisons with experimental measurements of current-voltage curves for a
specific ion channel.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a stochastic homogenization problem for evaluation of stochastic characteristics of a homogenized elastic property of a particle reinforced composite material especially in case of considering a non-uniform distribution of a material property or geometry of a component material and its random variation. In practice, some microscopic random variations in composites may not be uniform. In this case, a non-uniformly distributed random variation of a microscopic material or geometrical property should be taken into account. For this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchical stochastic homogenization method. This method assumes that a two-phase composite material can be separated into three-scales, and propagation of the randomness through the different scales can be evaluated with the perturbation-based technique. As an example, stochastic characteristics of homogenized elastic properties of a glass-particle reinforced plastic are estimated using the proposed approach. With the numerical results, importance of the problem and validity of the proposed method are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent advances in medical sciences have revealed the significance of cellular structures and morphology in biological function. A cell's membrane represents the boundary between the cells and its environment. The variations in cell surface and morphologies may be used as indications of malfunction or even diseases. If abnormalities such as cancer can be detected at the molecular level this will offer an important means for early diagnosis using small numbers of cells. The use of electron and scanning probe microscopy such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) could facilitates the opportunity to study and examine the molecular processes of living cells in greater details. The difficulties faced in direct cellular analysis when using and operating the AFM in situ for morphological studies of the cells has led to the development of a novel approach called Bioimprint (Traut and Papanicolaou, 1941 [1]). Inspired by the high resolution of nanoimprint lithography processes, Bioimprint has been applied to a new area of biological cell replication for the purpose of imaging and analysis and has revealed some very important biological events when combined with AFM imaging. For this research, the structural features of endometrial cancer cells were investigated. Regulation of selected peptides were examined, especially those which are associated with angiogenic factors that promote the proliferation of nutrient-bearing blood vessels that support tumour growth. Using the Bioimprint technique which is a soft lithography process, an impression of the cell topology was created by applying a layer of monomer mixture onto the cells attached to a substrate and rapidly curing it under UV-light. Fast UV-radiation enables the imprint to lock cellular processes within minutes and replicas of the cancer cells exhibit structures down to nanometer scale. Cancer cells were cultured and incubated in accordance with standard biological culturing procedures and protocols approved by the New Zealand Human Ethics Committee. High-resolution AFM imagery provides the opportunity to examine the structure and topography of the cells closely so that any abnormalities can be identified. To study the replicated imprints, the features that resembled secretory pores on the AFM images were noted. The numbers of pores correlated well with levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that were secreted by the cells. Further experiments were conducted in which anti-VEGF-coated microbeads were observed in the AFM images to be attracted to the areas of the pores.},

abstract = {During the last few years, continuous progresses in wireless communications have opened new research fields in computer networking, aimed at extending data networks connectivity to environments where wired solutions are impracticable. Among these, vehicular communication is attracting growing attention from both academia and industry, owing to the amount and importance of the related applications, ranging from road safety to traffic control and up to mobile entertainment. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are self-organized networks built up from moving vehicles, and are part of the broader class of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). Owing to their peculiar characteristics, VANETs require the definition of specific networking techniques, whose feasibility and performance are usually tested by means of simulation. One of the main challenges posed by VANETs simulations is the faithful characterization of vehicular mobility at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels, leading to realistic non-uniform distributions of cars and velocity, and unique connectivity dynamics. However, freely distributed tools which are commonly used for academic studies only consider limited vehicular mobility issues, while they pay little or no attention to vehicular traffic generation and its interaction with its motion constraints counterpart. Such a simplistic approach can easily raise doubts on the confidence of derived VANETs simulation results. In this paper we present VanetMobiSim, a freely available generator of realistic vehicular movement traces for networks simulators. The traces generated by VanetMobiSim are validated first by illustrating how the interaction between featured motion constraints and traffic generator models is able to reproduce typical phenomena of vehicular traffic. Then, the traces are formally validated against those obtained by TSIS-CORSIM, a benchmark traffic simulator in transportation research. This makes VanetMobiSim one of the few vehicular mobility simulator fully validated and freely available to the vehicular networks research community.},

abstract = {Optimization of signal control at isolated intersections has been an important research focus in traffic engineering over the past few years. Due to its flexibility and practicality, fully actuated control has been extensively deployed. In the conventional actuated control scheme, two important parameters, i.e., minimum and maximum green times, are arbitrarily prespecified, although it is widely recognized that they can significantly impact system operations. Previous studies have concentrated on computing these parameters using deterministic models. Due to the stochastic features of traffic arrival, such statically designated green time boundaries cannot sufficiently handle various traffic demands. To solve this problem, a stochastic model is established to dynamically optimize the minimum and maximum green times using real-time queue lengths and traffic arrival characteristics for each phase. Multiple criteria are fused and exploited as control objectives, such as avoiding cycle failures, minimizing control delays, and maximizing total traffic throughputs. Performance of the proposed algorithms is examined using a microscopic traffic simulation program, i.e., VISSIM 4.30, under various scenarios. The results show that the control system operated by the proposed algorithm produces promising improvements in system operation efficiency and fairness under various traffic demands.},

Based on an estimated average cell size and stain color, ICS rapidly indicates the approximate location and amount of cells in histological images of labeled embryonic tissue and provides estimates of cell counts in regions with saturated fluorescence and blurred cell boundaries.

To achieve this, a segmentation technique was developed, which relies on a rich feature space to describe the spatial neighbourhood of each pixel and employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. This segmentation approach is compared, using hand-labelled data, to a number of standard segmentation/thresholding methods commonly applied in microscopy. The importance of different features is also assessed using the method of minimum Redundancy, Maximum Relevance (mRMR), and the effect of different SVM kernels is also considered. The results show that the approach suggested in this paper attains much greater accuracy than standard techniques; in our comparisons with manually labelled data, our proposed technique is able to identify boundary pixels to an accuracy of 93%. More significantly, out of a set of 56 regions of image data, 43 regions were binarised to a useful level of accuracy. The results obtained from the image segmentation technique developed here may be used for the study of shape and alignment of ECs, and hence patterns of blood flow, around arterial branches.},

abstract = {The interest using novel drug delivery systems to improve oral bioavailability of drug with poor solubility is increasing. In this study, a new oral delivery system, polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles (PBCNs), was introduced to improve the oral bioavailability of puerarin (PUE). PUE-loaded PBCN was successfully prepared by anionic polymerization method. Characterization of PUE-loaded PBCN was evaluated with morphology, size, zeta potential, and in vitro release study. The PBCN loading PUE exhibited a spherical shape under transmission electron microscopy with an average size of 159.4 nm, and the zeta potential was -15.0mV. The in vitro release of PUE-loaded PBCN showed an initial burst release followed by a sustained release. Physicochemical state of PUE in PBCN was investigated by differential scanning colorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results indicated that PUE in PBCN was in a noncrystalline state. The oral pharmacokinetic study in rats showed that the relative bioavailability of PUE-encapsulated PBCN to the crude PUE was more than 550%. It can be concluded that PBCN as an oral drug carrier can significantly improve the oral bioavailability of PUE.},

In some applications, the segmented areas associated with different events overlap spatially and temporally forming random clumps. In order to study the shape-size features and durations of the events, it is a usual practice to analyze only isolated episodes. However, this sample is biased, because faster and smaller events tend to be isolated. We model the images as a realization of a cylindrical temporal Boolean model. We evaluate the bias introduced when ruling out non-isolated episodes. We propose an estimator of the duration distribution and perform a simulation study to assess its accuracy. The method is applied to fluorescent-tagged proteins image sequences. Results show that this procedure is effective for analyzing dynamic processes where spatial and temporal overlapping occurs.},

The algorithm produces results that agree well with manual segmentations, as jndged by the Hausdorff distance and the modified Williams index. The extraction of geometric-transformation-invariant features and optimization of the feature set by feature subset selection and Fisher transformation follow. Finally, different two-class object classifiers are compared. The sensitivity and specificity of all tested classifiers is above 95 % for the identification of bacillus objects represented by Fisher-transformed features. Our results may be used to reduce technician involvement in screening for TB, and would be particularly useful in laboratories in countries with a high burden of TB, where, typically, ZN rather than auramine staining of sputum smears is the method of choice.},

abstract = {Motivation:  Tiled serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) is increasingly used to describe high-resolution anatomy of large biological specimens. In particular in neurobiology, TEM is indispensable for analysis of synaptic connectivity in the brain. Registration of ssTEM image mosaics has to recover the 3D continuity and geometrical properties of the specimen in presence of various distortions that are applied to the tissue during sectioning, staining and imaging. These include staining artifacts, mechanical deformation, missing sections and the fact that structures may appear dissimilar in consecutive sections.  Results:  We developed a fully automatic, non-rigid but as-rigid-as-possible registration method for large tiled serial section microscopy stacks. We use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to identify corresponding landmarks within and across sections and globally optimize the pose of all tiles in terms of least square displacement of these landmark correspondences. We evaluate the precision of the approach using an artificially generated dataset designed to mimic the properties of TEM data. We demonstrate the performance of our method by registering an ssTEM dataset of the first instar larval brain of  Drosophila melanogaster  consisting of 6885 images.

The special circular support is designed to enhance the stiffness of the overhang beams. First, mechanical modeling of the leveraged torsion/cantilever beams was performed by Castigliano's theorem so as to deduce the spring stiffness of system. Then the device has been prepared by a laminated photoresist sacrificial layer process (LPSLP). Finally, mechanical performance was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), combined with finite element simulation using ANSYS(TM) package and analysis model as well. Switching between two stable states of the microactuator was successfully validated with WYKO NT1100 optical profiling system.},

abstract = {A novel methodology is introduced here that exploits 2D images of arbitrary elastic body deformation instances so as to quantify mechanoelastic characteristics that are deformation invariant. Determination of such characteristics allows for developing methods offering an image of the undeformed body. General assumptions about the mechanoelastic properties of the bodies are stated which lead to two different approaches for obtaining bodies' deformation invariants. One was developed to spot a deformed body's neutral line and its cross sections, while the other solves deformation PDEs by performing a set of equivalent image operations on the deformed body images. Both of these processes may furnish a body-undeformed version from its deformed image. This was confirmed by obtaining the undeformed shape of deformed parasites, cells (protozoa), fibers, and human lips. In addition, the method has been applied to the important problem of parasite automatic classification from their microscopic images. To achieve this, we first apply the previous method to straighten the highly deformed parasites, and then, apply a dedicated curve classification method to the straightened parasite contours. It is demonstrated that essentially different deformations of the same parasite give rise to practically the same undeformed shape, thus confirming the consistency of the introduced methodology. Finally, the developed pattern recognition method classifies the unwrapped parasites into six families, with an accuracy rate of 97.6 percent.},

abstract = {Replication of biological cells for the purpose of imaging and analysis under electron and scanning probe microscopy has facilitated the opportunity to study and examine some molecular processes of living cells in a manner that was not possible before. The difficulties faced in direct cellular analysis when using and operating atomic force microscopy (AFM) in situ for morphological studies of biological cells has lead to the development of a novel method for biological cell studies based on nanoimprint lithography. The realisation of the full potential of high-resolution AFM imaging has revealed some very important biological events such as exocytosis and endocytosis. In this work, a soft lithography bioimprint replication technique, which involved simple fabrication steps, was used to form a hard replica of the cell employing a newly developed biocompatible polymer that has fast curing time at room temperature essential for this process. The structure and topography of the endometrial (Ishikawa) cancer cell was investigated in this study. Cells were cultured and incubated in accordance with standard biological culturing procedures and protocols approved by the Human Ethics Committee, University of Otago. An impression of the cell profile was created by applying a layer of the polymer onto the cells attached to a substrate and rapidly cured under UV-light. Fast UV radiation helps to lock cellular processes within minutes after exposure and replicas of the cancer cells exhibit ultra-cellular structures and features down to nanometer scale. Elimination of the AFM tip damping effects due to probing of the soft biological tissue allows imaging with unprecedented resolution. High-resolution AFM imagery provides the opportunity to examine the structure and topography of the cells closely so that any abnormalities can be identified. Craters that resemble granules may be observed. These represent steps on a transitional series of sequential structures that indicate either an endocytotic or exocytotic processes, which were evident on the replicas. These events, together with exocytosis, play a very significant part in the tumorigenesis of these cancer cells. By forming cell replica impressions, not only have they the potential to understand biological cell conditions, but may also benefit in synthesizing three dimensional (3-D) scaffolds for natural growth of biological cells and provide an improvement over standard cell growth conditions.},

The motile bacteria were imaged by light microscopy and observed in replicate trials. It was found that bacteria were capable of swimming through even narrow microchannels and that their swimming paths, velocity and modes were influenced by a combined effect of channel width and its complexity.

abstract = {A theoretical formulation and corresponding numerical solutions are presented for microscopic fluid flows in porous media with the domain sufficiently large to reproduce integral Darcy scale effects. Pore space geometry and topology influence flow through media, but the difficulty of observing the configurations of real pore spaces limits understanding of their effects. A rigorous direct numerical simulation (DNS) of percolating flows is a formidable task due to intricacies of internal boundaries of the pore space. Representing the grain size distribution by means of repelling body forces in the equations governing fluid motion greatly simplifies computational efforts. An accurate representation of pore-scale geometry requires that within the solid the repelling forces attenuate flow to stagnation in a short time compared to the characteristic time scale of the pore-scale flow. In the computational model this is achieved by adopting an implicit immersed-boundary method with the attenuation time scale smaller than the time step of an explicit fluid model. A series of numerical simulations of the flow through randomly generated media of different porosities show that computational experiments can be equivalent to physical experiments with the added advantage of nearly complete observability. Besides obtaining macroscopic measures of permeability and tortuosity, numerical experiments can shed light on the effect of the pore space structure on bulk properties of Darcy scale flows.},

Comparison of numerical predictions and experiments involving six cells when the substrate was stretched by 15% showed that the deformed geometry agreed with an average error of &lt;0.55 µm, roughly one-hundredth the size of a cell, for the lower half of the range of cellular height. Numerical sensitivity analyses showed that the cellular deformation under substrate stretching, that is, displacement boundaries, is insensitive to the absolute value of the elastic modulus, but depends on the nuclear to cytoplasmic modulus ratio.},

abstract = {Amino-modified double wall carbon nanotube (DWCNT-NH2)/carbon fiber (CF)/epoxy hybrid micro-nanocomposite laminates were prepared by a resin infusion technique. DWCNT-NH2/epoxy nanocomposites and carbon fiber/epoxy microcomposites were made for comparison. Morphological analysis of the hybrid composites was performed using field emission scanning electron microscope. A good dispersion at low loadings of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in epoxymatrix was achieved by a bath ultrasonication method. Mechanical characterization of the hybrid micro-nanocomposites manufactured by a resin infusion process included three-point bending, mode I interlaminar toughness, dynamic mechanical analysis, and drop-weight impact testing. The addition of small amounts of CNTs (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 wt%) to epoxy resins for the fabrication of multiscale carbon fiber composites resulted in a maximum enhancement in flexural modulus by 35%, a 5% improvement in flexural strength, a 6% improvement in absorbed impact energy, and 23% decrease in the mode I interlaminar toughness. Hybridization of carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy using CNTs resulted in a reduction in Tg and dampening characteristics, presumably as a result of the presence of micron-sized agglomerates.},

abstract = {LiCoO2 nanopowders, one of the most important cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, were synthesized via a modified solgel process assisted with triethanolamine (TEA) as a complexing agent. The influence of three different chelating agents including acrylic acid, citric acid, and oxalic acid on the size and morphology of particles was investigated. Structure and morphology of the synthesized powders were characterized by thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results indicate that the powder processed with TEA and calcinated at 800°C had an excellent hexagonal ordering of α-NaFeO2-type (space group R3m). Also, the other three complexing agents had a decisive influence on the particle size, shape, morphology, and degree of agglomeration of the resulting oxides. Based on the data presented in this work, it is proposed that the optimized size and distribution of LiCoO2 powdersmay be achieved through sol-gel processing using TEA as a chelating agent.},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic approach to fabricate optically smooth, through-wafer silicon (Si) molds for polymer optical devices, in particular poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) total internal reflection (TIR)-based devices. First, the Si molds were fabricated by an optimized, through-wafer deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process to achieve small roughness. To further reduce the roughness, the Si molds were then oxidized and etched in BHF for three times to achieve surface roughness average (Ra) and root mean square (RMS) roughness below 25 nm while peak-to-valley (P---V) roughness is below 150 nm. We monitored the surface roughness and morphology of the sidewalls of Si mold through three cycles of oxidation and BHF etching using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found that further oxidation and BHF etching might not have much effect in further reducing the roughness while the device feature definitions might be compromised. Finally, the PDMS TIR-based devices replicated from the Si molds were evaluated by means of FESEM, AFM and by imaging of the fluorescent evanescent spots.},

abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Manual histological grading of FL is subject to remarkable inter- and intra-reader variations. A promising approach to grading is the development of a computer-assisted system that improves consistency and precision. Correlating information from adjacent slides with different stain types requires establishing spatial correspondences between the digitized section pair through a precise non-rigid image registration. However, the dissimilar appearances of the different stain types challenges existing registration methods. This study proposes a method for the automatic non-rigid registration of histological section images with different stain types. This method is based on matching high level features that are representative of small anatomical structures. This choice of feature provides a rich matching environment, but also results in a high mismatch probability. Matching confidence is increased by establishing local groups of coherent features through geometric reasoning. The proposed method is validated on a set of FL images representing different disease stages. Statistical analysis demonstrates that given a proper feature set the accuracy of automatic registration is comparable to manual registration.},

abstract = {The gate oxide reliability and the electrical behavior of FinFETs are directly related to the surface characteristics of the fin vertical sidewalls. The surface roughness of the fin sidewalls is one of the most important structural parameters to be monitored in order to optimize the fin patterning and postetch treatments. Because of the nanometer-scale dimensions of the fins and the vertical orientation of the sidewall surface, their roughness measurement is a serious challenge. In this paper, we describe a simple and effective method for measuring the sidewall morphology of silicon fins by conventional atomic force microscopy. The present methodology has been employed to analyze fins as etched by reactive ion etching and fins repaired by sacrificial oxidation. The results show that sacrificial oxidation not only reduces the roughness of the sidewalls, but also rounds the top corners of silicon fins. The present method can also be applied to characterize sidewall roughness of other nanostructures and materials such as the polysilicon gate of transistors or nanoelectromechanical beams.},

abstract = {To extract morphological features about nuclei from microscopy cellular image, it is usually required to find the edges of nuclei at first. Standard edge detection methods may not produce satisfactory results due to the varying brightness and background in cellular image. It is important to extract close, smooth, and correct edges in order to compute features like compactness, convexity, roundness, and etc. We present a new method to detect edges of nuclei in microscopy images. The method is based on using median filtering to compute the total variation with respect to the central pixel in a filter window. This step exploits one important feature of median filter, i.e., within the filter window, the total variation (TV) with respect to the median is always less than or equal to the TV with respect to the original center pixel. In other words, median filtering looks for the output that minimizes the total variation within the filtering window. The resulting image has enhanced contrast along the boundary of nuclei. As the final step, we use popular edge detection methods such as Canny detector and Laplacian of Gaussian to find edges of nuclei in the image. Examples from processing real cellular image obtained by light microscope show that the method obtains better edges in terms of connectivity, smoothness, and closely following the boundary of nuclei.},

abstract = {Experimental research seeking to quantify neuronal structure constantly contends with restrictions on image resolution and variability. In particular, experimentalists often need to analyze images with very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In many experiments, dye toxicity scales with the light intensity; this leads experimentalists to reduce image SNR in order to preserve the viability of the specimen. In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach for estimating the neuronal shape given low-SNR observations. This Bayesian framework has two major advantages. First, the method effectively incorporates known facts about 1) the image formation process, including blur and the Poisson nature of image noise at low intensities, and 2) dendritic shape, including the fact that dendrites are simply-connected geometric structures with smooth boundaries. Second, we may employ standard Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for quantifying the posterior uncertainty in our estimate of the dendritic shape. We describe an efficient computational implementation of these methods and demonstrate the algorithm's performance on simulated noisy two-photon laser-scanning microscopy images.},

abstract = {Outcome-dependent sampling designs are commonly used in economics, market research and epidemiological studies. Case-control sampling design is a classic example of outcome-dependent sampling, where exposure information is collected on subjects conditional on their disease status. In many situations, the outcome under consideration may have multiple categories instead of a simple dichotomization. For example, in a case-control study, there may be disease sub-classification among the ''cases'' based on progression of the disease, or in terms of other histological and morphological characteristics of the disease. In this note, we investigate the issue of fitting prospective multivariate generalized linear models to such multiple-category outcome data, ignoring the retrospective nature of the sampling design. We first provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the link functions that will allow for equivalence of prospective and retrospective inference for the parameters of interest. We show that for categorical outcomes, prospective-retrospective equivalence does not hold beyond the generalized multinomial logit link. We then derive an approximate expression for the bias incurred when link functions outside this class are used. Most popular models for ordinal response fall outside the multiplicative intercept class and one should be cautious while performing a naive prospective analysis of such data as the bias could be substantial. We illustrate the extent of bias through a real data example, based on the ongoing Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial by the National Cancer Institute. The simulations based on the real study illustrate that the bias approximations work well in practice.},

abstract = {Motivation:  Currently the confocal scanning microscopy of fluorescently tagged molecules is extensively employed to acquire quantitative data on gene expression at cellular resolution. Following this approach, we generated a large dataset on the expression of segmentation genes in the  Drosophila  blastoderm, that is widely used in systems biology studies. As data accuracy is of critical importance for the success of studies in this field, we took a shot to evaluate possible errors introduced in the data by acquisition and processing methods. This article deals with errors introduced by confocal microscope.  Results:  In confocal imaging, the inevitable photon noise is commonly reduced by the averaging of multiple frames. The averaging may introduce errors into the data, if single frames are clipped by microscope hardware. A method based on censoring technique is used to estimate and correct this type of errors. Additional source of errors is the quantification of blurred images. To estimate and correct these errors, the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution method was modified to provide the higher accuracy of data read off from blurred images of the  Drosophila  blastoderm. We have found that the sizes of errors introduced by confocal imaging make up ~5–7% of the mean intensity values and do not disguise the dynamic behavior and characteristic features of gene expression patterns. We also defined a range of microscope parameters for the acquisition of sufficiently accurate data.

abstract = {We report on ZnO nanorods grown by catalyst-free metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) in a commercial Epigress reactor using diethylzinc and N"2O as precursors. Well-aligned ZnO nanorods with uniform diameter, length and density have been grown perpendicularly to the sapphire (0001) surface. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used to observe the morphology of the ZnO nanorods and X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the crystalline structure of the nanorods. TEM observation as well as photoluminescence measurements confirm the very good crystalline quality of the nanorods. SEM observation on samples that have been prepared with various deposition times has been used in order to investigate the growth mechanism. Three types of ZnO morphologies have been identified: a thin two-dimensional ZnO layer formed at the sapphire surface, covered by three-dimensional hexagonal-shaped islands and hexagonal nanorods on top of them.},

abstract = {Optical microscopy is becoming an important technique in drug discovery and life science research. The approaches used to analyze optical microscopy images are generally classified into two categories: automatic and manual approaches. However, the existing automatic systems are rather limited in dealing with large volume of time-lapse microscopy images because of the complexity of cell behaviors and morphological variance. On the other hand, manual approaches are very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an effective automated, quantitative analysis system that can be used to segment, track, and quantize cell cycle behaviors of a large population of cells nuclei effectively and efficiently. We use adaptive thresholding and watershed algorithm for cell nuclei segmentation followed by a fragment merging method that combines two scoring models based on trend and no trend features. Using the context information of time-lapse data, the phases of cell nuclei are identified accurately via a Markov model. Experimental results show that the proposed system is effective for nuclei segmentation and phase identification.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of heavy commercial vehicles on traffic characteristics and operation of freeway merging sections. Freeways are designed to facilitate the flow of traffic, including passenger cars and trucks. The impact of these different vehicle types is not uniform, creating problems in freeway operations and safety, particularly in the vicinity of merging sections. There have been very few studies that are concerned with the traffic behavior and characteristics of heavy vehicles in these situations. Therefore, a three-year study was undertaken to investigate traffic behavior and operating characteristics during the merging process under congested traffic conditions. First extensive traffic data collection captured a wide range of traffic and geometric information using detectors, videotaping, and surveys at several interchanges. The macroscopic detector data were used to identify and quantify the impact of heavy commercial vehicles on the capacity of merging sections. Subsequently, the microscopic data were utilized to establish a model for the behavior of drivers at merging sections. Based on this behavioral model, a microsimulation program was developed to simulate the actual traffic conditions. This model was used to evaluate the capacity of a merging section for a given geometric design and traffic flow condition. In addition, this model was employed to develop a variety of intelligent transport system control strategies that are associated with heavy commercial vehicles with the goal of designing safer and less-congested freeway merging points. The implementation of the proposed control strategies showed significant improvement over the capacity of merging sections.},

This paper presents an API in AIMSUN, which is a stochastic and microscopic simulation model, to evaluate a novel real-time signal control technique based on the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. A transportation network of diamond interchanges is first created and calibrated in the AIMSUN environment. The API, which creates a dynamic link between the DP algorithm and AIMSUN, is then developed and deployed in C++. During simulation runtime, real-time traffic measurements, including vehicle counts and speeds, are provided by detectors in the network and fed into the DP algorithm that subsequently makes a decision on a signal control plan. The signal plan is then transferred back to and implemented in the simulated network, which emulates its actual operation. Extensive simulations have shown that the new signal control technique is superior to other common offline signal optimization tools in terms of handling the demand fluctuations. This paper has demonstrated that the API function is a useful tool to assess new ITS applications that are unavailable in simulation programs.},

We motivate the problem by considering the utility of shape discords in diverse domains including zoology, microscopy, anthropology, and medicine. While the brute force search algorithm has quadratic time complexity, we avoid this untenable lethargy by using locality-sensitive hashing to estimate similarity between shapes which enables us to reorder the search more efficiently and thus extract the maximum benefit from an admissible pruning strategy we introduce. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach is empirically linear in time.},

Conversion electron Mossbauer (CEM) spectra of @a-Fe"2O"3 thin films exhibit values for hyperfine parameter characteristic of the hematite stoichiometric phase in the weak ferromagnetic state [R.E. Vandenberghe, in: Mossbauer Spectroscopy and Applications in Geology, University Gent, Belgium, 1990. [1]]. Furthermore, the relative line intensity ratio suggests that the magnetization vector of the polycrystalline film is aligned preferentially parallel to the surface. The CEM spectra of Fe"3O"4 thin films show the presence of only the stoichiometric phase, and the values for the hyperfine fields and isomer shifts of the A and B sites are consistent with bulk Fe"3O"4[1]. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the polycrystalline thin films also corresponds to @a-Fe"2O"3 and Fe"3O"4 [JCPDS, X-ray diffraction data cards, 2001. [2]]. The samples were also analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and they reveal a grain morphology common for polycrystalline films.

Results show that the poly-Si has good crystallinity, and the electric field has the effect of enhancing the crystallization when DC electric voltage is added to the film during annealing. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) shows that the metal Ni improves the crystallization by diffusing into the a-Si thin film, so the crystallization of the lateral diffused region of Ni is the best.

In first stage, a preprocessing subsystem is realized for obtaining unique features from the same group of patterns. In second stage, a feature extraction mechanism which is based on the invariant moments is used. In third stage, an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) classifier is used for recognition process. We conduct computer simulations on MATLAB environment.

Overlapping cells are resolved by imposing a Voronoi-like tessellation of the image space optimized by a Bayesian probability framework. Intermediate slices are introduced between images to account for the insufficient slicing resolution. Results of the cellular segmentation step are used in conjunction with a cell shape model to interpolate the 3D cellular locations and shapes onto the adjacent slices thereby enhancing the expressivity and utility of the resulting visualizations. Our methods are applied in a case-study involving the 3D visualization of the epithelial cell lining and lobules in mouse mammary ducts.},

The effective diameter of a pore is defined as the maximum diameter of a spherical particle which can pass through the pore in the membrane. We for the first time applied advanced image analysis techniques to automatically measure effective pore diameters and their distribution from scanning electronic microscopic image of the membrane using Euclidean distance transform (EDT).

The generalization is called spatial-hidden Markov model (SHMM) that captures the contextual characteristics of complex biological features in histological images The model employs a second-order neighborhood system and assumes the conditional independence of vertical and horizontal transitions between hidden states. The notion of 'past' in SHMM is defined as what have been observed in a row-wise raster scan. This paper focuses on two fundamental problems: the best states decoding problem and the estimation of generation probability of an image by a SHMM. Based on our independence assumption of horizontal and vertical transitions, we derive computational tractable solutions to those problems. These solutions are direct extensions of their counterparts, i.e., the Viterbi algorithm and Forward-Backward algorithm, for 1-D HMM. Our experiments were carried on a medical image database with 200 images and compared with a state-of-the-art approach that was run on the same database. The annotation results demonstrated that SHMM consistently outperforms the previous approach and ameliorates many of its drawbacks. In addition, performance comparison with HMM has also validated the superiority of SHMM.},

It supports parallel disks, overlapping between disk I-O and computation and it is the first I-O-efficient algorithm library that supports the pipelining technique that can save more than half of the I-Os. STXXL has been applied both in academic and industrial environments for a range of problems including text processing, graph algorithms, computational geometry, Gaussian elimination, visualization, and analysis of microscopic images, differential cryptographic analysis, etc. The performance of STXXL and its applications are evaluated on synthetic and real-world inputs. We present the design of the library, how its performance features are supported, and demonstrate how the library integrates with STL.

Microcontact printing (µCP) using PDMS stamps and alkanethiol chemistry is a straightforward method for the structuring of gold layers. When using binary two dimensional (2D) stamps the softness of the elastomer limits the useable aspect ratio and it was shown that nm-sized features with µm spacing cannot be replicated with binary PDMS stamps. To bypass this limitation we used 2.5 dimensional PDMS stamps with pyramidal shaped topography to fabricate sub-100nm gold islands with a spacing of 6µm on areas of several square millimeters. The masters, the stamps and the resulting gold structures were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).},

abstract = {Nano-scale pattern templates have been manufactured in order to study the differences in cell behaviour between fibroblasts cultured on smooth and on grooved substrata. The pattern templates were made on silicon wafers using electron beam lithography in hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) and subsequent reactive ion etching (RIE). These masters were replicated in polystyrene cell culture material using solvent casting. The replicas were assessed with atomic force microscopy (AFM). After seeding with fibroblasts, morphological characteristics were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy, in order to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on cell alignment. It appears that both groove depth and width determine the cellular alignment on patterns with a ridge/groove ratio of 1:1. On smooth substrata, cells always spread out in a random fashion. There appears to be a threshold groove barrier size of around 70-80nm, above which random cell spreading is not possible anymore and contact guidance occurs. It is speculated that this threshold size may be associated with the size of contact molecules at the cell extensions, which grow and find anchoring spots preceding cell spread out and cell alignment.},

abstract = {Visual search and identification of analyzable metaphase chromosomes using optical microscopes is a very tedious and time-consuming task that is routinely performed in genetic laboratories to detect and diagnose cancers and genetic diseases. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a computerized scheme that can automatically identify chromosomes in metaphase stage and classify them into analyzable and un-analyzable groups. Two independent datasets involving 170 images are used to train and test the scheme. The scheme uses image filtering, threshold, and labeling algorithms to detect chromosomes, followed by computing a set of features for each individual chromosome as well as for each identified metaphase cell. Two machine learning classifiers including a decision tree (DT) based on the features of individual chromosomes and an artificial neural network (ANN) using the features of the metaphase cells are optimized and tested to classify between analyzable and un-analyzable cells. Using the DT based classifier the Kappa coefficients for agreement between the cytogeneticist and the scheme are 0.83 and 0.89 for the training and testing datasets, respectively. We apply an independent testing and a 2-fold cross-validation method to assess the performance of the ANN-based classifier. The area under and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.93 for the complete dataset. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a computerized scheme to automatically identify and classify metaphase chromosomes.},

The natural frequencies of the optical lever are a function of material, geometry, and elastic properties of the microstructure. In this regard, the geometry of the structure can be altered in post-fabrication using such methods as laser drilling or focused ion beam machining. Several slot sizes are investigated and the eigenvalues obtained are mapped as a function of the slot length and width. In this regard, the elastic property of the optical lever can be tuned through material removal in either a mass or stiffness reduction arrangement in which a particular slot size and configuration is machined into the optical lever structure. In this work a slot cut into the optical lever using focused ion beam machining is used to passively tune the natural frequencies and mode shapes of suspended microcantilever structures used for optical lever scanning such as in AFM probes. This analysis will contribute to the performance optimization of AFM probes and microresonators. The Rayleigh---Ritz energy method is used for the theoretical analysis and a non-contact optical test method is used to obtain the natural frequency of several slotted AFM optical levers.},

The geometry of the surface structures depends on the ion-beam mixing (IBM) conditions, metal thickness and substrate material. It was found that optical properties of the samples are affected by multipolar surface plasmon resonances (SPR) in nanoislands. The comparison of extinction and absorption spectra has resulted in considerable insight concerning the nature of SPR modes. The resonance wavelength can be adjusted throughout the visible region by substrate material, IBM conditions, ion specie and RIE post treatment.},

abstract = {The proportionator is a novel and radically different approach to sampling with microscopes based on the well-known statistical theory (probability proportional to size-PPS sampling). It uses automatic image analysis, with a large range of options, to assign to every field of view in the section a weight proportional to some characteristic of the structure under study. A typical and very simple example, examined here, is the amount of color characteristic for the structure, marked with a stain with known properties. The color may be specific or not. In the recorded list of weights in all fields, the desired number of fields is sampled automatically with probability proportional to the weight and presented to the expert observer. Using any known stereological probe and estimator, the correct count in these fields leads to a simple, unbiased estimate of the total amount of structure in the sections examined, which in turn leads to any of the known stereological estimates including size distributions and spatial distributions. The unbiasedness is not a function of the assumed relation between the weight and the structure, which is in practice always a biased relation from a stereological (integral geometric) point of view. The efficiency of the proportionator depends, however, directly on this relation to be positive. The sampling and estimation procedure is simulated in sections with characteristics and various kinds of noises in possibly realistic ranges. In all cases examined, the proportionator is 2-15-fold more efficient than the common systematic, uniformly random sampling. The simulations also indicate that the lack of a simple predictor of the coefficient of error (CE) due to field-to-field variation is a more severe problem for uniform sampling strategies than anticipated. Because of its entirely different sampling strategy, based on known but non-uniform sampling probabilities, the proportionator for the first time allows the real CE at the section level to be automatically estimated (not just predicted), unbiased-for all estimators and at no extra cost to the user.},

Two chitosan samples of different molecular weights (Mw = 9.7 \texttimes{} 104 and 1.09 \texttimes{} 106 gundefinedmol-1) were used as original materials. Hollow capsules were also obtained by dissolution of the core in hydrochloric acid. Electron microscopy revealed that the surface of the shell is rather ragged associated with some agglomerates. The shell thickness l obeys a linear relation with respect to the number of deposited layers m as l = md + a(a &gt; 0). The values of d (thickness per layer) were 4.0 and 1.0 nm for the higher and lower Mw chitosan materials, respectively, both of which are greater than the thickness of the monolayer. The results suggest that the feature of the deposition does not obey an ideal homogeneous monolayer-by-monolayer deposition mechanism. Shell crosslinked capsules were also prepared via photodimerization reaction of cinnamoyl groups after a deposition of cinnamoyl chitosan to the calcium carbonate whisker core. The degree of crosslink was not enough to stabilize the shell structure, and hollow capsule was not obtained.},

The interpretation and analysis of such features are difficult. This lack of coincidence between computed features and their meaning for a user in a given situation is commonly referred to as the semantic gap. In this work, we propose a method for feature analysis and interpretation based on the simultaneous visualization of feature and image domain. Histopathological images of meningiomas WHO (World Health Organization) grade I are represented by features derived from color transforms and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. The wavelet-based feature space is then visualized and explored using unsupervised machine learning methods.

The simulation uses known histological morphology, cell types, and stochastic behavior to specifically model ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a common form of non-invasive breast cancer. Using this model we examine the effects of hereditary predisposition on DCIS incidence and aggressiveness. Results show that we are able to reproduce in vivo pathological features to hereditary forms of breast cancer: earlier incidence and increased aggressiveness.

The measured resistivity in CNF arrays is modeled based on known graphite two-dimensional hopping electron conduction mechanism. The model is used because of the disordered graphite structure observed during high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of the CNF and CNF-metal interface. Second, electrical reliability measurements are performed at different temperatures to demonstrate the robust nature of CNFs for interconnect applications.

Therefore, an automation of Gleason grading would be desirable. In this paper, we examined 780 digitized grayscale images of 78 different cases, which were split into a training and a test set. We developed two methods based on combinations of morphological characteristics like area fraction, line length, and Euler number to classify into the categories "Gleason score &lt;7" and "Gleason score ges7." In particular, the distinction between these two classes has great impact on the prognosis of patients.

Featureless appear the surfaces of films spin coated at 8krpm from a 1.25% solution on silicon substrates and postbaked at 200^oC for 2min on a hot plate, while surface defects in the form of large circular pits with diameters between 10 and 20@mm and depth of ~2nm dominate the surface morphologies of films spin coated at 7krpm on glass substrates from a 2% solution and postbaked either at 200^oC for 2min on a hot plate or at 170^oC for 30min in an oven. Surface defects in the form of pinholes appear on the surfaces of films spin coated at 8krpm on silicon substrates from a 1.25% solution (thickness of ~8nm) and postbaked at 170^oC for 60min in an oven or left in a low vacuum chamber for a few days. The implication of the different film properties-depending on the preparation parameters-in lithographic techniques is explained and discussed in the paper.},

abstract = {The physical (microtomy), optical (microscopy), and radiologic (tomography) sectioning of biological objects and their digitization lead to stacks of images. Due to the sectioning process and disturbances, movement of objects during imaging for example, adjacent images of the image stack are not optimally aligned to each other. Such mismatches have to be corrected automatically by suitable registration methods.Here, a whole brain of a Sprague Dawley rat was serially sectioned and stained followed by digitizing the 20 m thin histologic sections. We describe how to prepare the images for subsequent automatic intensity based registration. Different registration schemes are presented and their results compared to each other from an anatomical and mathematical perspective. In the first part we concentrate on rigid and affine linear methods and deal only with linear mismatches of the images. Digitized images of stained histologic sections often exhibit inhomogenities of the gray level distribution coming from staining and/or sectioning variations. Therefore, a method is developed that is robust with respect to inhomogenities and artifacts. Furthermore we combined this approach by minimizing a suitable distance measure for shear and rotation mismatches of foreground objects after applying the principal axes transform. As a consequence of our investigations, we must emphasize that the combination of a robust principal axes based registration in combination with optimizing translation, rotation and shearing errors gives rise to the best reconstruction results from the mathematical and anatomical view point.Because the sectioning process introduces nonlinear deformations to the relative thin histologic sections as well, an elastic registration has to be applied to correct these deformations.In the second part of the study a detailed description of the advances of an elastic registration after affine linear registration of the rat brain is given. We found quantitative evidence that affine linear registration is a suitable starting point for the alignment of histologic sections but elastic registration must be performed to improve significantly the registration result. A strategy is presented that enables to register elastically the affine linear preregistered~ rat brain sections and the first one hundred images of serial histologic sections through both occipital lobes of a human brain (6112 images). Additionally, we will describe how a parallel implementation of the elastic registration was realized. Finally, the computed force fields have been applied here for the first time to the morphometrized data of cells determined automatically by an image analytic framework.},

abstract = {Analytical electron microscopy today is an emerging technique allowing for the composition analysis of solids with high spatial resolution down to 1nm or less. In particular energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) is becoming a technique which is frequently applied to study nanometric semiconductor device features. Among the advantages of EFTEM are the possibility to directly correlate elemental distributions and structural or morphological details as well as the good sensitivity particularly for low Z elements. However, quantitative information on the local composition is difficult to be obtained from EFTEM. This is due to the lack of accurately known elemental ionization cross-sections for the experimental conditions used in a particular EFTEM experiment, in which the TEM parameters are usually chosen in an attempt to give optimum imaging conditions. In addition, theoretical predictions of such cross-sections are still too inaccurate today. In this paper it is shown that it is possible to overcome these difficulties by supplementing EFTEM with standardless ion beam analysis techniques such as Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA). By this, the high resolution of the microscopic technique is combined with the inherent accuracy of nuclear probe techniques and 2-d distributions of absolute atomic densities are obtained. This is examplified using multi-layer structures of Si-C-N dielectrics and multi-elemental carbon-rich spacer layers on silicon.},

In addition to probe geometry, the slope of the probe with respect to the sample is of importance. In this work, probe geometry is determined by the use of structured foils obtained using focused ion beam (FIB). In this manner, we demonstrate the possibility of determining the AFM probe geometry and the slope on the basis of differently-sized structures. An established algorithm was implemented for the reconstruction of the probes. The shape of FIB structured foils was determined separately by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).},

A drawback of the application is the sensitivity of the method to different kinds of charges in the surface passivation layer. For a systematic study silicon structures with stripe patterns of different doping concentrations, covered either by a native oxide or by a thermally grown silicondioxide layer, were examined. The dependence of the dC/dV characteristic on the sweep rate of the tip bias and on the bias sweep direction was analyzed. Local charge trapping in the passivation layer was estimated from shifts of the peak position of the dC/dV versus V curves. It is demonstrated as to how features related to the charge trapping in the passivation layer and induced by a certain dc bias at the tip superimpose the dopant related features in the SCM image.},

This scheme utilizes measured and finite element analysis (FEA) natural frequencies that are paired together according to their mode shapes, and it incorporates an optimization sequence that formulates the frequency differences as an error vector to be minimized. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure, two examples are shown in this paper. One example involves a microcantilever fabricated from a single-crystalline silicon wafer, and the updating process is applied on the cantilever to identify its Young's modulus. The identified Young's modulus (along &lt;100&gt; direction) of 130.29 GPa is very comparable to those in the literature. The other example concerns a commercial, V-shaped silicon nitride probe used in an atomic force microscope. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of the probe are measured, the FEA performed, and the probe thickness and the Young's modulus of the silicon nitride substrate determined. The identified thickness is also verified by SEM images of the probe. Both examples show that the updating procedure converged in just a few iterations.},

Extraction of personal features from stroke shape, writing pressure and pen inclination in ordinary characters. In: Proc. 5th Internat. Conf. on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR1999), pp. 426-429] based on a P-type Fourier descriptor-based learning vector quantisation scheme. To implement a text-independent, DP-based biometric writer verification, our spotting-enabling CDP algorithm has not only successfully traced and tracked an optimal microscopic dynamic features of real-time writing processes of either scanned characters or images of relevant individuals but also has implemented extension to a more secure text-independent writer verification method by exploiting the built-in spotting function of the CDP method, which is capable of ignoring inputs outside the task domain. This is so because a text-independent sample can be selected from any of many possible candidates located at an arbitrary location within the specified long reference sample. We have demonstrated the applicability of the method not only to Japanese text but also to English text that tends to assess the language independence of the method.},

abstract = {Recently, shape matching in three dimensions (3-D) has been gaining importance in a wide variety of fields such as computer graphics, computer vision, medicine, and biology, with applications such as object recognition, medical diagnosis, and quantitative morphological analysis of biological operations. Automatic shape matching techniques developed in the field of computer graphics handle object surfaces, but ignore intensities of inner voxels. In biology and medical imaging, voxel intensities obtained by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imagery (MRI), and confocal microscopes are important to determine point correspondences. Nevertheless, most biomedical volume matching techniques require human interactions, and automatic methods assume matched objects to have very similar shapes so as to avoid combinatorial explosions of point. This article is aimed at decreasing the gap between the two fields. The proposed method automatically finds dense point correspondences between two grayscale volumes; i.e., finds a correspondent in the second volume for every voxel in the first volume, based on the voxel intensities. Mutiresolutional pyramids are introduced to reduce computational load and handle highly plastic objects. We calculate the average shape of a set of similar objects and give a measure of plasticity to compare them. Matching results can also be used to generate intermediate volumes for morphing. We use various data to validate the effectiveness of our method: we calculate the average shape and plasticity of a set of fly brain cells, and we also match a human skull and an orangutan skull},

We considered double split ring resonators (negative permeability particles) with additional capacitive gaps to compensate for the inertial inductance, as well as complementary double split rings (negative permittivity). We calculated dispersion relations and considered scaling conditions for our structures. For the fabrication of our experimental samples we used scanning probe nanolithography with z-scanner movement in 20nm thin silver layers sputtered on positive photoresist or on polycarbonate. The morphology of our structures was characterized by atomic force microscope. We utilized a line width of 80-120nm and the nanolithographic groove depth in different samples ranged from 4 to 80nm. We believe our approach could be useful as a simple and low-cost tool for fabrication, assessment and optimization of different metamaterial geometries before larger arrays of particles are fabricated using other, more sophisticated and complex methods.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of nanoscale technological imperfections to the macroscopic behavior of ordered composite structures for photonic applications. A connection between the deviations from the designed geometry on nanoscopic level and macroscopic behavior was established using amplitude and frequency noise as the primary figures of merit. We calculated the influence of nanoscale deviations by transfer matrix technique, while surface roughness was taken into account by using the effective medium theory. As an example we considered our nonuniform silicon/silica 1D photonic bandgap structures fabricated by rf sputtering, which contained defect layers with spatially varying thickness. The cross-sections and surface morphology of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy while spectral transmission was measured by FTIR spectrometry. It was established that thickness deviations of 5-7nm caused scattering losses of 20-40%, while lattice parameter change of 70nm resulted in spectral transmission shift of about 70nm. The approach is applicable to other mesoscopic and subwavelength structures, including those with higher dimensional (2D and 3D) geometries and could be used as a means for fast assessment of optical nanodevice fabrication systems.},

abstract = {An automatic extraction method for apoptotic cells from videomicroscopy images is proposed. The edges of the apoptotic cells in the microscopy images are gentle and thick because of the fluorescence enzyme used for the observation; their shapes are distorted circles; the apoptotic cells also neighbor on the other cells. Since the apoptotic cells cannot be easily extracted, they are generally extracted by visual recognition. Therefore, we propose a method to automatically extract only apoptotic cells based on shape features. The proposed method, in the first stage, extracts areas with strong possibilities that apoptotic cells are included. In the second stage, the method applies shape-feature analysis to the extracted areas. By using these two stages, the proposed method can accurately extract the apoptotic cells without increasing computational costs. Further, when videomicroscopy images are acquired as an image sequence, the proposed method can extract the cells more accurately by comparing the extraction results in neighboring frames. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Comp Jpn, 37(3): 32–40, 2006; Published online in Wiley InterScience ().

With the actual location of the tip on the cantilever taken into consideration, modal analysis is carried out to obtain the cantilever TR frequencies/mode shapes under linear elastic tip---sample interaction. The relations of lateral contact stiffness and viscosity to torsional amplitude/phase shift are established. A comprehensive understanding on the effects of lateral contact stiffness and viscosity, driving frequency, and tip location on the cantilever torsional amplitude/phase shift is achieved by parametric analysis. The basic methodology to extract in-plane surface properties in TR mode is described.

In this approach, two types of essential microstructural morphologies (spheral particles and interconnected graft channels) are modeled based on statistical geometry theory, and the statistical analysis schemes of the microstructural morphologies are designed and applied to the characterization of the phase-separated microstructures in fuel-cell components such as solid electrolyte ionomers, catalyst layers, and gas diffusion layers.

Since the epidermis is the most complex structured epithelial tissue, systems biology models could yield important insights in epithelial tissue, in which most of all human cancers arise.  Results:  We describe the algorithms of a system, capable of simulating the tissue homeostasis in human epidermis leading to a horizontally layered tissue with cells of different differentiation stages. The system predicts epidermal morphology, tissue kinetics and 2D flow of Ca2+ ions. Predicted properties of an epidermis with a healthy and a disturbed barrier are compared with the literature. The system closely mimics the respecting physiological situations.  Availability:  Additional information and films of the simulation are available at the website.

One of the most important considerations in fabricating a photodetector is achieving a low dark current condition, which is critical in producing UV photodetectors with a high signal-to-noise ratio. For this purpose, thermal treatment has been proven to be a useful method in reducing the leakage current in a Schottky contact, as well as reducing the dark current in a Schottky contact based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetector. In this work, GaN based MSM photodetectors (photodiodes) with nickel (Ni) Schottky contacts were fabricated and characterized. The application of thermal treatment to the contacts at various annealing temperatures (400-700^oC) was investigated. Cryogenic cooling after heat treatment was also performed to determine the effects of this treatment on the electrical characteristics of the devices. Electrical and morphological characterization was performed by current-voltage (I-V) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, respectively.},

abstract = {The Self Organising Tree Map (SOTM) neural network is investigated as a means of segmenting micro-organisms from confocal microscope image data. Features describing pixel and regional intensities, phase congruency and spatial proximity are explored in terms of their impact on the segmentation of bacteria and other micro-organisms. The significance of individual features is investigated, and it is proposed that, within the context of micro-biological image segmentation, better object delineation can be achieved if certain features are more dominant in the initial stages of learning. In this way, other features are allowed to become more/less significant as learning progresses: as more knowledge is acquired about the data being segmented. We argue that the efficiency and flexibility of the SOTM in adapting to, and preserving the topology of input space, makes it an appropriate candidate for implementing this idea. We propose a refinement to the competitive search strategy that allows for a more appropriate fusion of signal and proximal features, thereby promoting a segmentation that is more sensitive to the regional associations of different microbial matter. A refined stop criterion is also suggested such that the dynamically generated number of classes becomes more data dependant. Preliminary experiments are presented and it is found that favouring intensity characteristics in the early phases of learning, whilst relaxing proximity constraints in later phases of learning, offers a general mechanism through which we can improve the segmentation of microbial constituents.},

abstract = {The inner layer of the human cornea, called the corneal endothelium, plays an important role in the maintenance of corneal transparency. Specular microscopy is the most widely used technique to study the corneal endothelium in vivo. Improvements in technology have allowed us to obtain good quality specular images, but the detection and quantification of small size-shape cell changes is not obvious, specially when the physician wants to evaluate endothelial cell changes after some surgical procedures. This paper proposes a methodology to analyze specular microscopy images. Every corneal endothelium is described by means of different cumulative distribution functions or some moments (mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, and skewness) of these distribution functions. These distributions are defined from different granulometries based on successive structural openings of the corneal endothelium. Changes in cell morphology are pointed out by comparing the cumulative distribution function (or the corresponding moments) of a given patient with the corresponding cumulative distribution functions (or their moments) of a group of age-matched controls. Different comparison procedures are given, providing us with different numerical evaluations of the corneal endothelium status. These new indices are compared with the classic descriptors used in commercial packages (density, hexagonality, and coefficient of variation of cell areas). Detailed analysis of different images of corneal endothelia are given using the classic and new indices jointly.},

abstract = {The problem of recovering geometric properties of a domain from the trace of the heat kernel for an initial-boundary value problem arises in NMR microscopy and other applications. It is similar to the problem of "hearing the shape of a drum," for which a Poisson-type summation formula relates geometric properties of the domain to the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet or Neumann problems for the Laplace equation. It is well known that the area, circumference, and the number of holes in a planar domain can be recovered from the short-time asymptotics of the solution of the initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation. It is alsoknown that the length spectrum of closed billiard ball trajectories in the domain is contained in the spectral density of the Laplace operator with the given boundary conditions in the domain, from which the short-time hyperasymptotics of the trace of the heat kernel can be obtained by the Laplace transform. However, the problem of recovering these lengths from measured values of the trace of the heat kernel (the "resurgence" problem) is unresolved. In this paper we develop a simple algorithm for extracting the lengths from the short-time hyperasymptotic expansion of the trace. We give an alternative construction of the short-time expansion of the trace by constructing a ray approximation to the heat kernel for a planar domain with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We evaluate the trace by introducing the rays as global coordinates.},

abstract = {As the semiconductor industry moves to the 32 nm node, it becomes apparent that new lithography technology will be needed. One possibility for fabricating this feature size is extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology. With the advent of EUV, new high performance resist materials will need to be developed. This study looks at the use of a poly[4-hydroxystyrene-co-2-(4-methoxybutyl)-2-adamantyl methacrylate] system as a possible candidate material for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL). This material was synthesized and evaluated as an EUV chemically amplified resist. This resist system showed reasonable sensitivity and contrast compared to conventional PMMA resist. This resist system exhibits both negative and positive tone behavior at high and low dose, respectively. A negative pattern of 35 nm L/S (70 nm pitch) was printed using the transmission-grating EUV Interference Lithography (EUV-IL) tool [J.K. Chen, F.H. Ko, H.L. Chen, F.C. Chang, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 42 (2003) 3838]. A positive pattern of 50 nm (pitch 180 nm) was achieved using the EUVL tool at Sandia National Laboratory [Synchrotron Radiation Center website www.src.wisc.edu &amp; Center for Nanotechnology website www.nanotech.wisc.edu]. Resist patterns were characterized in detail using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Both showed similar characteristics of the pattern lines.},

abstract = {Since the conception of the first lasers in the 60's, the knowledge and consequently the applications of laser have been widely increased. Laser surface texturing is a specific field among the various applications of the laser. This technique is employed in the aim of improving tribological performances for instance. This paper presents the laser surface texturing of a heterogeneous material. This material is lamellar cast iron. It has been chosen for its good friction properties. The textured surface is composed of grooves or dimples. The dimensions are micrometric. For the grooves, different cross sections have been engraved: semicircular, rectangular, trapezoidal and triangular. The dimples are cylindrical. All these laser textured surfaces are engraved with the laser manufacturing machine: DML 40 SI of Gildemeister (Germany). This machine is equipped with a galvanometric scanner, which allows tilted surfaces to be engraved. Various machining strategies and the following results are discussed in function of the different desired laser surface texturing results. In addition, to increase the aspect of the engraved surfaces, laser polishing is employed. Thanks to a defocalisation of the laser beam on the surface, the material is not ablated but melted. To be able to compare the different laser machining process, several techniques of control have been used: roughness profilometry, scanning electron microscopy and non contacting optical measurement. The rules of use of these methods must be defined bearing in mind their inherent limitations.},

abstract = {Control of cell-to-surface adhesion has significant impacts on various biological and biomedical applications. In this study, nano-/microtextured surfaces produced by a unique surface texturing technique, Al-induced crystallization of amorphous silicon, were utilized to control the adhesion of Escherichia coli cells on glass substrates in the fabrication of an E. coli-based whole-cell chemical sensor. Cell adhesion experiments were conducted in microfluidic systems composed of a micromolded polydimethylsiloxane microchannel bonded to a nano-/microtextured glass surface. Cell adhesion on the textured surfaces was monitored and recorded by a phase-contrast microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera. It was determined that nano-/microtextured surfaces significantly enhanced cell-to-surface adhesion over microtextured surfaces and smooth surfaces. The number of cells adhered on the nano-/microtextured surfaces was found to be more than two times higher than that on the smooth surfaces for multiple injections of cell culture into the microchannel. Study of the cell-to-surface adhesion mechanism suggests that the number of adhered cells per unit area can be controlled by controlling the particle density on the textured surfaces.},

abstract = {This paper elucidates the thermal behavior of an LED employing metal filled polymer matrix as thermal interface material (TIM) for an enhanced heat dissipation characteristic. Highly thermal conductive aluminum (Al) particles were incorporated in bisphenol A diglycidylether (DGEBA) epoxy matrix to study the effect of filler to polymer ratio on the thermal performance of high power LEDs. The curing behavior of DGEBA was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The dispersion nature of the Al fillers in polymer matrix was verified with Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). The thermal performance of synthesized Al filled polymer composite as TIM was tested with an LED employing thermal transient measurement technique. Comparing the filler to polymer ratio, the rise in junction temperature for 60wt% Al filled composite was higher by 11.1 C than 50wt% Al filled composite at cured state. Observed also from the structure function analysis that the total thermal resistance was 10.96K/W higher for 60wt% Al filled composite compared to 50wt% Al filled composite. On the other hand, a significant rise of 9.5 C in the junction temperature between cured and uncured samples of 50wt% Al filled polymer TIM was observed and hence the importance of curing process of metal filled polymer composite for effective heat dissipation is discussed extensively in this work. Thermal behavior of LED with metal filled polymer matrix as TIM was investigated.Al was filled into DGEBA polymer matrix and applied as TIM for LED heat dissipation.Comparison of filler to polymer ratio showed that TIM performs best at 50wt% Al.Also found that cured TIM performs better thermal characteristics than uncured TIM.Optical properties are crucial to determine thermal behavior of the LEDs under test.},

The effects of thermal annealing on the electrical and structural properties of Ni/Au Schottky contacts to n-type GaN were investigated by current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile analysis. The metallization patterns on GaN grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on a (0001) sapphire substrate were formed using the photolithography and lift-off techniques. The Schottky barrier height (SBH) for these contacts was obtained from I-V and C-V measurements. The value of SBH of the as-deposited contacts was found to be 0.560 0.004eV (from I-V) and 0.622 0.018eV (from C-V) with an ideality factor of 1.856 0.085. The values of SBH obtained from the C-V measurements were found to be higher than that of obtained from the I-V measurements. This case was attributed to the presence of the lateral inhomogeneities of the barrier height. However, the values of SBH slightly increase after the annealing temperatures at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 C. The SBH of the Ni/Au Schottky contact for the other annealing temperature of 600 C was 0.617 0.005eV. The highest value of SBH for Ni/Au Schottky contact was obtained after annealing at 700 C and the value was 0.910 0.019eV. The variations in the chemical composition of the contacts with the annealing process were examined by XPS depth profile analysis.},

Tin doped indium oxide (ITO) thin films were fabricated by sol-gel spin coating (S-G-S) method with In(NO3)3 H2O and SnCl4 as indium and tin precursors, respectively. Polyvinylalcohol (PVA) was used for synthesis of ITO sol as a stabilizer and binder. The influence of different pyrolysis temperatures after each coating on the electrical, optical, structural, and morphological properties of the films were characterized by means of four point probe, UV-Vis, FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then the prepared thin films were annealed in the temperature of 550 C under argon atmosphere (the rate of 100mL/min and the pressure of 10Torr). The obtained results indicate that minimum resistivity of 12.5 10-4 cm and optical transmittance of more than 83% in the UV-Vis region with a band gap of 3.84eV were achieved for the films pyrolyzed at 500 C for 30min.

abstract = {Microscopic thin section images are a major source of information on physical properties, crystallization processes, and the evolution of rocks. Extracting the boundaries of grains is of special interest for estimating the volumetric structure of sandstone. To deal with large datasets and to relieve the geologist from a manual analysis of images, automated methods are needed for the segmentation task. This paper evaluates the region competition framework, which also includes region merging. The procedure minimizes an energy functional based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. To overcome some known drawbacks of current algorithms, we present an extension of MDL-based region merging by integrating edge information between adjacent regions. In addition, we introduce a modified implementation for region competition for overcoming computational complexities when dealing with multiple competing regions. Commonly used methods are based on solving differential equations for describing the movement of boundaries, whereas our approach implements a simple updating scheme. Furthermore, we propose intensity features for reducing the amount of data. They are derived by comparing theoretical values obtained from a model function describing the intensity inside uniaxial crystals with measured data. Error, standard deviation, and phase shift between the model and intensity measurements preserve sufficient information for a proper segmentation. Additionally, identified objects are classified into quartz grains, anhydrite, and reaction fringes by these features. This grouping is, in turn, used to improve the segmentation process further. We illustrate the benefits of this approach by four samples of microscopic thin sections and quantify them in a comparison of a segmentation result and a manually obtained one. HighlightsIntroduce additional gradient-based term for edge-weighted MDL-based region merging.Proposed term allows better balancing of the merging order regarding smaller and larger regions.Validity of our approach is tested on several thin section images.Validity of our approach is tested against a manually segmented image.},

This work proposes a histology image indexing strategy based on multimodal representations obtained from the combination of visual features and associated semantic annotations. Both data modalities are complementary information sources for an image retrieval system, since visual features lack explicit semantic information and semantic terms do not usually describe the visual appearance of images. The paper proposes a novel strategy to build a fused image representation using matrix factorization algorithms and data reconstruction principles to generate a set of multimodal features. The methodology can seamlessly recover the multimodal representation of images without semantic annotations, allowing us to index new images using visual features only, and also accepting single example images as queries. Experimental evaluations on three different histology image data sets show that our strategy is a simple, yet effective approach to building multimodal representations for histology image search, and outperforms the response of the popular late fusion approach to combine information.},

abstract = {Fluorescent microscopy imaging is a popular and well-established method for biomedical research. However, the large number of images created in each research trial quickly eliminates the possibility of a manual annotation; thus, the need for automatic image annotation is quickly becoming an urgent need. Furthermore, the high clustering indexes and noise observed in these images contribute to a complex issue, which has attracted the attention of the scientific community. In this paper, we present a fully automated method for annotating fluorescent confocal microscopy images in highly complex conditions. The proposed method relies on a multi-layered segmentation and declustering process, which begins with an adaptive segmentation step using a two-level Otsu's Method. The second layer is comprised of two probabilistic classifiers, responsible for determining how many components may constitute each segmented region. The first of these employs rule-based reasoning grounded on the decreasing harmonic pattern observed in the region area density function, while the second one consists of a Support Vector Machine trained with features derived from the log likelihood ratio function of Gaussian mixture models of each region. Our results indicate that the proposed method is able to perform the identification and annotation process on par with an expert human subject, thus presenting itself a viable alternative to the traditional manual approach.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes have attracted the fancy of many scientists since their first discovery in 1991. Their small dimensions, strength and remarkable physical properties make them a very unique material with a whole range of promising applications. The most important application of carbon nanotubes based on their important mechanical properties will be as reinforcements in composite materials, especially nanotube-filled polymer composites are an obvious materials application area. In this work, the micro-structured devices in range of micro meter have been manufactured based on polymer/carbon nanotubes composites by using hot embossing replication process. Firstly, the carbon nanotubes with different loading rate (0.1, 1 and 10 %) have been mixed with polypropylene (PP) in molten state to obtain the composite, the rheological properties of MWCNTs/PP composites with different CNT loading ratios were investigated by means of rheometer with a cone-and-plate geometry, the improvement of dispersion of the CNT particles in polypropylene matrix were observed by scanning electronic microscopy. Afterwards, the obtained composite were granulated in particles and used in hot embossing process to realize the replication of micro structured; in this step, a Al mould with micro-motif on surface obtain by machining with computer numerical control machine tools has been used. Finally, the micro-structured motifs on the mould have been successfully transferred with the details on the MWCNTs/PP substrate under the embossing pressure.},

abstract = {Mathematical modelling has been used to comprehend the pathology and the assessment of different treatment techniques such as heart failure and left ventricular assist device therapy in the cardiovascular field. In this study, an in-silico model of the heart is developed to understand the effects of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) as a pathological scenario, with mechanisms described at the cellular, protein and organ levels. This model includes the right and left atria and ventricles, as well as the systemic and pulmonary arteries and veins.First, a multi-scale model of the whole heart is simulated for healthy conditions. Subsequently, the model is modified at its microscopic and macroscopic spatial scale to obtain the characteristics of IDC. The extracellular calcium concentration, the binding affinity of calcium binding proteins and the maximum and minimum elastances have been identified as key parameters across all relevant scales. The modified parameters cause a change in (a) intracellular calcium concentration characterising cellular properties, such as calcium channel currents or the action potential, (b) the proteins being involved in the sliding filament mechanism and the proportion of the attached crossbridges at the protein level, as well as (c) the pressure and volume values at the organ level. This model allows to obtain insight and understanding of the effects of the treatment techniques, from a physiological and biological point of view. A multi-scale model of the left ventricle and circulation is presented.This model helps studying idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) in a multi-scale context.It can reproduce well-known characteristics of the disease by varying key parameters.It provides insight on IDC by trying to explain potential mechanisms at multiple biological scales.It could be applied to simulate other pathological cases or pharmacological intervention.},

Reconstructing a virtual computational environment is crucial for designing and implementing individual interactions in an artificial society as human beings behave in the real world. In this paper, we propose a methodology to recreate a virtual city by utilizing statistical data and geographic information. The synthetic population and physical environment are baseline components of the virtual city. Individual-based modeling is used to specify individuals' demographic characteristics, and each individual is endowed with heterogeneous social attributes. Various physical environments are generated with geographic locations and mapped with individuals to support daily mobility, migration, and interaction. A series of algorithms are proposed to bridge the gap between macroscopic data and microscopic models, and guarantee equivalence between them. Based on the methodology, we reconstructed a virtual city of Beijing, and presented the statistical analysis of population structure, spatial distribution of physical environments, human travel characteristics, and spatial topologies of social networks. Our synthetic population can represent individual actors in the form of households and household members, and the synthetic population is statistically equivalent to a real population. The proposed methodology is efficient to recreate a synthetic virtual city and can serve as a base for computational experiments.},

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic model composed of a set of differential equations to describe the evolution of streaming service systems. And in the model, we focus on how the policies for admission control and peer selection influence on the system. We first introduce a flexible abstraction of streaming service systems. The abstraction is generally enough to capture the essences of streaming service systems with different structures, physical characteristics, software protocols and client behaviors. Then, by analyzing the state which is defined as the number of requests, a novel dynamic model is developed in microscopic scale to characterize the behaviors of streaming service systems. The model proposed in this paper demonstrates the interactions between clients and servers and also between different servers. The interactions are primarily influenced by the admission control policy and peer selection policy. Finally, some experiments are designed to verify the validation and reasonability of the model.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to experimentally investigate the capability of four non-destructive testing NDT techniques to detect the layer orientation in textile composite laminates. The aerospace industry has been the primary driving force in the use of textile composites. Design/methodology/approach - Woven glass fiber composite samples were inspected using C-scan ultrasonic, vibration analyzer, X-ray micro-tomography and ultraviolet technique. In a complementary study, mechanical testing was carried out to investigate the effect of mid-layer orientation on in-plane tensile strength and their failure modes using microscopic imagining. Findings - During C-scan ultrasonic, the high attenuation and scattering of ultrasonic waves caused by the textile fabric layers limited its application to only detect the first layer of samples. Frequency response tests of composite samples were also conducted to investigate the effect of mid-layer orientation on dynamic responses. The same trend was observed in the finite element modeling results with a clear effect of the fiber orientation defect seen in frequency response function response and higher mode shapes. Moreover, the results of micro computed tomography demonstrate that this technique could definitely detect the orientation of each layer; however, X-ray imaging at small scales introduced some challenges. Images obtained from ultraviolet technique did not reveal mid-layer orientation. Originality/value - In this paper, the application of different NDT techniques along with finite element modeling to inspect two-dimensional textile composites was presented. Hopefully, the research results presented here will lead to much published papers in inspection of textile composites.},

abstract = {As the advancement of nanotechnology, it is possible to manipulate structures at nanoscale with various nanomanipulation tools such as scanning probe microscopes. To achieve successful manipulations, precise motion control is required, especially for objects with sizes from subnanometer to several nanometers. To address this issue, this paper presents an image based non-vector space control approach. Considering images obtained from the microscopes as sets, the dynamics of the system can be formulated in the space of sets. Since the linear structure of the vector space is not available in this space, this method is called the non-vector space control. With the dynamics in the non-vector space, we formulate the stabilization problem and design the controller. The stabilization controller is tested with images obtained by atomic force microscopes, and the results verify the proposed theory. The method presented in this paper does not rely on external sensors for position feedback. Moreover, unlike the traditional image based control method, we do not need to extract features from images and track them during the control process. Finally, the control precision can be as good as the imaging resolution. The approach presented in this paper can also be extended to other systems where the states can be represented as sets.},

abstract = {Electrical nanoprobing inside scanning electron microscopy (SEM) systems has become a routinely used characterization technique for electrically measuring prototypes of the most advanced nanoelectronics device structures. Tungsten wire needles with a sharpness of about 50-100nm are commonly used as probe tips in these measurements. They suffer unfortunately from tip oxidation effects and need to be initialized. Moreover, they are too soft to directly probe on semiconductor materials such as Si and Ge. Therefore, harder probe tips are required which can withstand high pressures (in GPa range) and oxidation. In order to meet these requirements, we have developed doped diamond tips and integrated them into metal cantilevers. They have an in-plane geometry which allows direct visibility in the SEM system of both the area to be contacted and the tip apex. Furthermore, the probes are mounted at the end of a metal wire which ensures compatibility with existing nanoprobing systems and allows for convenient probe handling. This paper describes the probe concept and discusses the probe fabrication process in detail. Manufactured probes are presented and their suitability for measurements on a Ge calibration structure is demonstrated. Our work shows that the developed diamond nanoprobes overcome the disadvantages of existing tungsten wire probes and enable the probing of semiconductor materials.},

abstract = {It has been known since the pioneering works by Piola, Cosserat, Mindlin, Toupin, Eringen, Green, Rivlin and Germain that many micro-structural effects in mechanical systems can be still modeled by means of continuum theories. When needed, the displacement field must be complemented by additional kinematical descriptors, called sometimes microstructural fields. In this paper, a technologically important class of fibrous composite reinforcements is considered and their mechanical behavior is described at finite strains by means of a second-gradient, hyperelastic, orthotropic continuum theory which is obtained as the limit case of a micromorphic theory. Following Mindlin and Eringen, we consider a micromorphic continuum theory based on an enriched kinematics constituted by the displacement field u and a second-order tensor field ψ describing microscopic deformations. The governing equations in weak form are used to perform numerical simulations in which a bias extension test is reproduced. We show that second-gradient energy terms allow for an effective prediction of the onset of internal shear boundary layers which are transition zones between two different shear deformation modes. The existence of these boundary layers cannot be described by a simple first-gradient model, and its features are related to second-gradient material coefficients. The obtained numerical results, together with the available experimental evidences, allow us to estimate the order of magnitude of the introduced second-gradient coefficients by inverse approach. This justifies the need of a novel measurement campaign aimed to estimate the value of the introduced second-gradient parameters for a wide class of fibrous materials.},

abstract = {Lane-changing algorithms have attracted increased attention during recent years. However, limited research has been conducted to address the probability of changing lanes as a function of driver characteristics and lane-changing scenarios. This study contributes to the development of a comprehensive framework for modeling drivers' lane-changing maneuver on arterials by using driver behavior-related data. Focus group studies and “in-vehicle” driving tests were performed to investigate the effects of driver type under various lane changes on urban arterials and to collect microscopic vehicular data. With these field collected values, a model was developed to estimate the probability of changing lanes under various lane-changing scenarios and to estimate the corresponding gap acceptance characteristics. The lane-changing probability for each scenario was modeled as a function of the factors identified from the focus group discussions, as well as the driver types. In the gap acceptance modeling, a sequence of “hand-shaking negotiations” was introduced to describe vehicle interactions that may occur during lane-changing maneuvers. The proposed lane-changing model was implemented in the CORSIM CORrider SIMulation micro-simulator. The simulation capabilities of the newly developed model were compared to the original lane-changing algorithm in CORSIM and to the field observations. The validation results indicated that the new model better replicates the observed traffic under various levels of flow.},

For the surfaces with the same skewness but different autocorrelation lengths, the rms residuals have no significant differences. The surface parameters of the fabricated artifacts are in close agreements with their expected values. To further elucidate the geometric interactions between the tip and roughness structure in AFM measurements, blind tip estimations were carried out on the scanned images. The tip estimation deviation increases with the increase of autocorrelation length for the Gaussian surfaces. The skewed structures help to improve the estimation accuracy. By a proper design of the surface quantities, the artifacts can serve as reference areal roughness standards at the nanoscale and a kind of tip characterizers.},

abstract = {The surge in vehicular network research has led, over the last few years, to the proposal of countless network solutions specifically designed for vehicular environments. A vast majority of such solutions has been evaluated by means of simulation, since experimental and analytical approaches are often impractical and intractable, respectively. The reliability of the simulative evaluation is thus paramount to the performance analysis of vehicular networks, and the first distinctive feature that has to be properly accounted for is the mobility of vehicles, i.e., network nodes. Notwithstanding the improvements that vehicular mobility modeling has undergone over the last decade, no vehicular mobility dataset is publicly available today that captures both the macroscopic and microscopic dynamics of road traffic over a large urban region. In this paper, we present a realistic synthetic dataset, covering 24 hours of car traffic in a 400- ${rm km}^{2}$  region around the city of K\"{o}ln, in Germany. We describe the generation process and outline how the dataset improves the traces currently employed for the simulative evaluation of vehicular networks. We also show the potential impact that such a comprehensive mobility dataset has on the network protocol performance analysis, demonstrating how incomplete representations of vehicular mobility may result in over-optimistic network connectivity and protocol performance.},

abstract = {For milling an arbitrary surface, several models exist in which the tool must be moved close and away from the workpiece with its consequential problems caused by the contact between the tool and the mechanized material. One of these problems is the undesirable mechanizing marks on the surface, which can be avoided with the use of tangential tool-paths, causing another disadvantage: the additional time-consumption. Spiral tool-paths eliminate these problems and allow for continuous machining of the part without approach or withdrawal. Deterministic models for obtaining the tool positions referred to the part need to apply complex mathematical operations. For this reason, the idea of using non-deterministic techniques, with a controlled tolerance margin, allows to avoid those mathematical and geometrical operations. It also makes possible to reduce the processing times with no loss of dimensional quality and a good superficial finishing, which was confirmed with a coordinate measuring machine and with confocal microscopy, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the described method was assessed comparing its results with the performance of three of the most relevant CAM software commercially available. The obtained results are shown at the end of this paper.},

However, the influence of fine-scale deformation has not been considered in coarse-scale simulations. Thus, the simulation of highly nonhomogeneous detailed cloth is prone to large errors. We introduce an effective method to simulate cloth made of nonhomogeneous, anisotropic materials. We precompute a macroscopic stiffness that incorporates anisotropy from the microscopic structure, using the deformation computed for each unit strain. At every time step of the simulation, we compute the deformation of coarse meshes using the coarsened stiffness, which saves computational time and add higher-level details constructed by the characteristic displacement of simulated meshes. We demonstrate that anisotropic and inhomogeneous cloth models can be simulated efficiently using our method. © 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {In recent years, classification of colon biopsy images has become an active research area. Traditionally, colon cancer is diagnosed using microscopic analysis. However, the process is subjective and leads to considerable inter/intra observer variation. Therefore, reliable computer-aided colon cancer detection techniques are in high demand. In this paper, we propose a colon biopsy image classification system, called CBIC, which benefits from discriminatory capabilities of information rich hybrid feature spaces, and performance enhancement based on ensemble classification methodology. Normal and malignant colon biopsy images differ with each other in terms of the color distribution of different biological constituents. The colors of different constituents are sharp in normal images, whereas the colors diffuse with each other in malignant images. In order to exploit this variation, two feature types, namely color components based statistical moments (CCSM) and Haralick features have been proposed, which are color components based variants of their traditional counterparts. Moreover, in normal colon biopsy images, epithelial cells possess sharp and well-defined edges. Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) based features have been employed to exploit this information. Different combinations of hybrid features have been constructed from HOG, CCSM, and Haralick features. The minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection method has been employed to select meaningful features from individual and hybrid feature sets. Finally, an ensemble classifier based on majority voting has been proposed, which classifies colon biopsy images using the selected features. Linear, RBF, and sigmoid SVM have been employed as base classifiers. The proposed system has been tested on 174 colon biopsy images, and improved performance (=98.85%) has been observed compared to previously reported studies. Additionally, the use of mRMR method has been justified by comparing the performance of CBIC on original and reduced feature sets.},

Numerical simulation has been carried out to analyze transient polymer behavior with various levels of imprinting velocity from time step and polymer thickness, in thermal nanoimprint lithography (NIL). The location of the polymer maximum height (peak), the peak height in a cavity, and polymer filling shapes were predicted according to the polymer thickness. It can be seen that the peak height gradually increases with the imprinting velocity and that this affects the peak location in the cavity as the polymer thickness decreases. This phenomenon leads to polymer filling shapes various and changeable from double peak to single peak. These numerical results are compared with experimental data from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the two are found to be well matched.},

abstract = {In order to quantitatively analyze biological images and study underlying mechanisms of the cellular and subcellular processes, it is often required to track a large number of particles involved in these processes. Manual tracking can be performed by the biologists, but the workload is very heavy. In this paper, we present an automatic particle tracking method for analyzing an essential subcellular process, namely clathrin mediated endocytosis. The framework of the tracking method is an extension of the classical multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT), and it is designed to manage trajectories, solve data association problems, and handle pseudo-splitting/merging events. In the extended MHT framework, particle tracking becomes evaluating two types of hypotheses. The first one is the trajectory-related hypothesis, to test whether a recovered trajectory is correct, and the second one is the observation-related hypothesis, to test whether an observation from an image belongs to a real particle. Here, an observation refers to a detected particle and its feature vector. To detect the particles in 2D fluorescence images taken using total internal reflection microscopy, the images are segmented into regions, and the features of the particles are obtained by fitting Gaussian mixture models into each of the image regions. Specific models are developed according to the properties of the particles. The proposed tracking method is demonstrated on synthetic data under different scenarios and applied to real data.},

Both of the vapor–liquid–solid and vapor–solid (VS) mechanism occurred concurrently during the growth of In$_{2}$O $_{3}$ nanorods. The catalyst on the top of the nanorod is evident for the VLS mechanism. Meanwhile, the diameter of the nanorod mismatched the size of the catalyst and transmission electron microscopy study revealed that the sidewall of the nanorod was rough at the atomic scale during the growth, which is evident for the VS mechanism. The In$_{2}$O $_{3}$ nanorods became faceted eventually with a pyramidal tip, composed of {1&nbsp;0&nbsp;0} and {1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1} facets with lower total surface energy at the growth temperature.

We derive a joint observation and mixing model and show how it affects endmember identifiability within the geometrical unmixing framework. An analysis of the model reveals that nonnegative blurring results in a contraction of both the minimum-volume enclosing and maximum-volume enclosed simplex. We demonstrate this contraction property in the case of a spectrally invariant point-spread function. The benefit of prior deconvolution on the accuracy of the restored sources and abundances is illustrated using simulated and real Raman spectroscopic data.},

We use a confocal infrared laser scanning optical microscope to collect multimodal images through the backside of the IC. Individual modes correspond to passive reflectivity measurements or active measurements, such as light-induced voltage alteration. The modes are registered and stored in a multidimensional data cube. We apply a machine learning algorithm using a binary representation to identify a variety of data structures from transistors to entire logic cells. Because of the compact representation, objects can be detected rapidly. We show that by increasing the number of imaging modes used to develop the descriptor, we can significantly increase recognition accuracy. The approach allows recognition of poorly resolved components, whose primary distinguishing features are below traditional optical resolution limits, and is general enough to be applied to multiple design processes. We believe this represents a significant step toward a fully non-invasive IC reverse engineering system.},

abstract = {Information propagation within the blogosphere is of much importance in implementing policies, marketing research, launching new products, and other applications. In this paper, we take a microscopic view of the information propagation pattern in blogosphere by investigating  blog cascade affinity . A  blog cascade  is a group of posts linked together discussing about the same topic, and  cascade affinity  refers to the phenomenon of a blog's inclination to join a specific cascade. We identify and analyze an array of  macroscopic  and  microscopic  content-oblivious features that may affect a blogger's cascade joining behavior and utilize these features to predict cascade affinity of blogs. Based on these features, we present two non-probabilistic and probabilistic strategies, namely support vector machine (SVM) classification-based approach and  Bipartite Markov Random Field -based (BiMRF) approach, respectively, to predict the probability of blogs' affinity to a cascade and rank them accordingly. Evaluated on a real dataset consisting of 873,496 posts, our experimental results demonstrate that our prediction strategy can generate high quality results (  $$F1$$ -measure of 72.5 % for SVM and 71.1 % for BiMRF) comparing with the approaches using traditional or singular features only such as elapsed time, number of participants which is around 11.2 and 8.9 %, respectively. Our experiments also showed that among all features identified, the  number of quasi-friends  is the most important factor affecting bloggers' inclination to join cascades.},

abstract = {Conventional scanning probe microscopy (SPM)-based nanomanipulations always have to face scanner accuracy problems such as hysteresis, nonlinearity, and thermal drift. Although some scanners consist of internal position sensors, the sensitivity is not high enough to monitor high-resolution nanomanipulations. Additionally, once the scan size decreases to a nanolevel such as less than 100&nbsp;nm, the noise brought by sensors is large enough to affect the performance of the closed-loop motion control system. In this paper, a non-vector space control strategy based on compressive feedback is proposed in order to improve the accuracy of SPM-based nanomanipulations. In this approach, local images (or compressive data) are used as both the reference input and feedback for a non-vector space closed-loop controller which considers the local image (or compressive data) as a set. The controller is designed in non-vector space, and it requires no prior information on features or landmarks which are widely used in traditional visual servoing. In this paper, the atomic force microscopy is used as an example of SPM to implement the non-vector space control strategy for nanomanipulations. The motivation of designing such a non-vector space controller is to solve the accuracy problem in nanomanipulation. Without this technique, the SPM-based nanomanipulations, such as nanomeasurement and nanosurgery, are difficult to conduct, with accuracy controlled under several nanometers. In order to illustrate the contributions and potential applications of this non-vector controller, at the end of this paper, an application of carbon nanotube local electrical property characterization based on a non-vector space motion control is shown to clearly verify the concept. Compared with other research in the local electrical property characterization, the non-vector space controller can ensure that the measurement accuracy (position error) is controlled within a few nanometers, which also ensures the reliability of measurement results. Additionally, this non-vector space control method can be implemented into any kind of SPM to realize a real-time control for nanomanipulation such as nanofabrication and nanoassembly.},

abstract = {In this work, a thin polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is deposited on n-type InP substrate as an interfacial layer for electronic modification of Au/n-InP Schottky structure. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) results show that there is no significant degradation in the surface morphology of the PVC Schottky contact even after annealing at 200^oC. The electrical parameters of Au/PVC/n-InP are calculated by current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) techniques as a function of annealing temperature. Results show that the Au/PVC/n-InP structure exhibits an excellent rectifying behavior. The extracted barrier height (BH) of as-deposited Au/PVC/n-InP Schottky contact is 0.78eV (I-V) and 0.87eV (C-V). However, it is noted that the BHs increases to 0.85eV (I-V) and 0.96eV (C-V) upon annealing at 100^oC and then slightly decreases after annealing at 200^oC. Results indicate that the PVC film increases the effective barrier height by influencing the space charge region of the Au/n-InP junction. The series resistance of the Au/PVC/n-InP structure is extracted by Cheung's method. The interface state density (N"s"s) as determined by Terman's method is found to be 2.018x10^1^2 and 1.599x10^1^2eV^-^1cm^-^2 for the as-deposited and 100^oC annealed Au/PVC/n-InP Schottky contacts, respectively.

Since reaching a high CACC market penetration level is not occurring in the near future, this study presents a progressive deployment approach that demonstrates to have a great potential of reducing traffic congestions at low CACC penetration levels. Using a previously developed microscopic traffic simulation model of a freeway with an on-ramp -- created to induce perturbations and trigger stop-and-go traffic, the CACC system's effect on the traffic performance is studied. The results show significance and indicate the potential of CACC systems to improve traffic characteristics which can be used to reduce traffic congestion. The study shows that the impact of CACC is positive and not only limited to a high market penetration. By giving CACC vehicles priority access to high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, the highway capacity could be significantly improved with a CACC penetration as low as 20%.},

The most extensive evaluation uses a set of synthetic 2D images. We also show three examples of real problems: registering a set of 2D images extracted from synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR  $$upmu $$ CT) volumes depicting bone implants; the difficult multi-modal registration task of finding the exact location of a 2D slice of a bone implant, as imaged by a light microscope, within a 3D SR  $$upmu $$ CT volume of the same implant; and finally recognition of handwritten characters. The evaluation shows that our new set distance performs well for all tasks and outperforms the other observed distance measures in most cases.

abstract = {The hierarchical SnO2 sphere-like architecture, consisting of numerous thin nanosheets, was successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The structures and morphologies of this hierarchical architecture were characterized in detail by means of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). Further comparative experiments of gas-sensing performances of the as-prepared SnO2 were investigated towards ethanol. It shows this three-dimensional, sheet-spheres, SnO2 as a potential gas-sensing material for a broad range of future sensor applications, like sensitive response to other gases such as hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and methane.},

abstract = {The water absorption capacity of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) is important for agricultural drought resistance. However, herbicides may leach into the soil and affect water absorption by damaging the SAP three-dimensional membrane structures. We used 100-mesh sieves, electron microscopy, and fractal theory to study swelling and water absorption in SAPs in the presence of three common herbicides (atrazine, alachlor, and tribenuron-methyl) at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/L. In the sieve experiments it was found that 2.0 mg/L atrazine reduces the capacity by 9.64–23.3% at different swelling points; no significant diminution was observed for the other herbicides or for lower atrazine concentrations. We found that the hydrogel membrane pore distributions have fractal characteristics in both deionized water and atrazine solution. The 2.0 mg/L atrazine destroyed the water-retaining polymer membrane pores and reduced the water-absorbing mass by modifying its three-dimensional membrane structure. A linear correlation was observed between the fractal analysis and the water-absorbing mass. Multifractal analysis characterized the membrane pore distribution by using the range of singularity indexes Δα (relative distinguishing range of 16.54–23.44%), which is superior to single-fractal analysis that uses the fractal dimension D (relative distinguishing range of 2.5–4.0%).},

The successful doping of Mn2+- Co2+-Ni2+ tridoped ions into the host CdS (or ZnS) was proved by the EDX spectra. The luminescence of CdS is only enhanced when monodoped with Mn2+ whereas it is enhanced when ZnS is either monodoped with Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ or tridoped with Mn2+-Co2+-Ni2+.

abstract = {The degradation behavior and mechanical properties of polycaprolactone/nanohydroxyapatite composite scaffolds are studied in phosphate buffered solution (PBS), at 37°C, over 16 weeks. Under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it was observed that the longer the porous scaffolds remained in the PBS, the more significant the thickening of the pore walls of the scaffold morphology was. A decrease in the compressive properties, such as the modulus and the strength of the PCL/nHA composite scaffolds, was observed as the degradation experiment progressed. Samples with high nHA concentrations degraded more significantly in comparison to those with a lower content. Pure PCL retained its mechanical properties comparatively well in the study over the period of degradation. After the twelfth week, the results obtained by GPC analysis indicated a significant reduction in their molecular weight. The addition of nHA particles to the scaffolds accelerated the weight loss of the composites and increased their capacity to absorb water during the initial degradation process. The addition of these particles also affected the degradation behavior of the composite scaffolds, although they were not effective at compensating the decrease in pH prompted by the degradation products of the PCL.},

We evaluated the adherence of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata on a heat-cured Acron resin piece supported by AgNPs by low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and measuring colony-forming units. C. albicans and C. glabrata increasingly adhered to the resin surface of the control piece over time, but the adhesion AgNP of both Candida species to the AgNP-coated surface was significantly inhibited (P &lt; 0.001). Low-vacuum SEM revealed that C. albicans and C. glabrata on the resin surface of control pieces appeared as oval colonies, with a major axis of 3-4 μm and a smooth cell wall, but those on the AgNP-coated resin surface were less abundant than the control and showed swollen yeast features, with a major axis of more than 5 μm and a corrugated cell wall. Our results suggest a way to prevent denture-associated OC by using denture base materials processed by AgNPs.},

Specimens were immersed in orange juice, cola, and distilled water for 5 days and the nanohardness, elastic modulus, and wear behavior of the samples were determined via the nanoindentation test and a reciprocating nanoscratch test. The nanoscratch morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the wear depth was recorded by scanning probe microscopy (SPM). The results indicate that the nanofilled resin composites had the greatest hardest and highest elastic modulus, whereas the microfilled composites exhibited the lowest nanohardness and elastic modulus values. SEM observations showed that all resin composites underwent erosion and surface degradation after immersion in acidic solutions. Furthermore, the wear resistance was influenced by the composition of the acidic solution and was correlated with the nanohardness and elastic modulus. The dominant wear mechanism changed from plastic deformation to delamination after immersion in acidic solutions.},

abstract = {The cornea is the front of the eye. Its inner cell layer, called the endothelium, is important because it is closely related to the light transparency of the cornea. An in vivo observation of this layer is performed by using specular microscopy to evaluate the health of the cells: a high spatial density will result in a good transparency. Thus, the main criterion required by ophthalmologists is the cell density of the cornea endothelium, mainly obtained by an image segmentation process. Different methods can perform the image segmentation of these cells, and the three most performing methods are studied here. The question for the ophthalmologists is how to choose the best algorithm and to obtain the best possible results with it. This paper presents a methodology to compare these algorithms together. Moreover, by the way of geometric dissimilarity criteria, the algorithms are tuned up, and the best parameter values are thus proposed to the expert ophthalmologists.},

The NP interface yields photocurrent enhancement (PE) in thin film silicon devices by up to 200% which is significantly greater than previously reported values. For coatings produced from Ag nanoink containing particles with average diameter of 40 nm, an optimal NP surface coverage φ of 7% is observed. Scanning electron microscopy of interface morphologies revealed that for low φ, particles are well separated, resulting in broadband PE. At higher φ, formation of particle strings and clusters causes red-shifting of the PE peak and a narrower spectral response.},

The composition, structure, and morphology of polyurethanes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and element detection by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, respectively. Thermal stability was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Barrier properties and surface area studies were investigated by nitrogen permeability machine and BET technique. Mechanical properties were calculated by tensile universal testing machine. Results showed well dispersed MWCNTs in polyurethane matrix at different weight percentages. The best results were obtained with 0.3 wt% of MWCNTs in the composite. Surface area studies revealed presence of very few pores which is in a good agreement with barrier permeability, reduced up to ∼68% in 1wt% and ∼70% in 0.5 wt% of MWCNTs in polymer matrix, with respect to pure COPUs samples.},

Minimum inhibitory (MICs) and minimum fungicidal/bactericidal concentrations (MFC/MBC) were determined on planktonic cells. Also, total biofilm mass was determined by crystal violet (CV) staining and morphological changes by scanning electron microscope (SEM). MICs for C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, S. aureus, and MRSA were 15.63, 3.91, 1.95, and 1.95 µg/mL, respectively. MFC for C. glabrata was 62.5 µg/mL and for C. tropicalis 15.63 µg/mL The same MBC (3.91 µg/mL) was observed for S. aureus and MRSA. CV assay showed that the AgNPs (1000 µg/mL) promoted reductions in biofilm mass of ∼60% for C. glabrata and ∼35% for C. tropicalis. A reduction of ∼20% in C. tropicalis biomass was also observed at the concentration of 3.91 µg/mL. No significant effect on total biomass was found for S. aureus and MRSA. SEM images revealed that C. glabrata and C. tropicalis biofilm cells, exposed to the AgNPs (1000 µg/mL), had an irregular and shriveled appearance. AgNPs solution exhibited considerable antimicrobial activity against important fungal and bacterial pathogens, associated with several oral and systemic diseases, and has potential as an antimicrobial agent.},

The size of nanorods based on the Debye-Scherrer effect, was 150 nm, the average value of length and width. They display thermal stability over prolonged heating times (&lt;100 hours) at 150°C, for which the average particle size is roughly constant.

Calcination of the powders produced was carried out at varying temperatures, specifically at 400°C and 800°C, in air for 4 hours. When compared to the conventional hydrothermal transformation method, this chemical method is very simple, economic, due to the fact that it needs inexpensive and safe equipment, because the transformation of the aragonite and calcite of the shells into the calcium phosphate phases takes place at 80°C under the atmospheric pressure. The powders produced were determined using infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The features of the powders produced along with the fact of their biological origin qualify these powders for further consideration and experimentation to fabricate nanoceramic biomaterials.},

Removal experiments of Pb2+ ions were carried out in aqueous solutions with controlled concentration of Pb2+ at a fixed pH value of 3 and 5 respectively. After the removal experiment of Pb2+ ions from solutions, porous hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were transformed into PbMTHAp_3 and PbMTHAp_5 via the adsorption of Pb2+ ions followed by a cation exchange reaction. The X-ray diffraction spectra of PbMTHAp_3 and PbMTHAp_5 revealed that the powders, after removal of the Pb2+ ions, were a mixture of Ca2.5Pb7.5(PO4)6(OH)2, Pb2Ca4(PO4)2(SiO4), and Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2.

A possible mechanism was proposed for the growth of segmented nanobelts. It is possible that the growth of the segmented nanobelts is dominated by both vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid mechanisms. Devices made of single GeSe2 nanobelt have been fabricated and their photoelectrical property has been investigated.

Spherical iron nanoparticles coated with a carbon shell were obtained by amodified arc-discharge reactor, which permits controlling the diameter of the iron core and the carbon shell of the particles. Oxidized iron nanoparticles involve a loss of the magnetic characteristics and also changes in the chemical properties. Our nanoparticles show superparamagnetic behavior and high magnetic saturation owing to the high purity α-Fe of core and to the high core sealing, provided by the carbon shell. A liquid iron precursor was injected in the plasma spot dragged by an inert gas flow. A fixed arc-discharge current of 40 A was used to secure a stable discharge, and several samples were produced at different conditions. Transmission electron microscopy indicated an iron core diameter between 5 and 9 nm. Selected area electron diffraction provided evidences of a highly crystalline and dense iron core. The magnetic properties were studied up to 5K temperature using a superconducting quantum interference device. The results reveal a superparamagnetic behaviour, a narrow size distribution (σg = 1.22), and an average diameter of 6 nm for nanoparticles having a blocking temperature near 40K.},

abstract = {Nanofer zerovalent iron (nanofer ZVI) is a new and innovative nanomaterial capable of removing organic as well as inorganic contaminants in water. It displays a decrease in agglomeration, when it is coated with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). TEOS imparts an increase in reactivity and stability to nanofer ZVI. Characteristics of nanofer ZVI were determined using scanning electron microscope/electron dispersive spectroscope (SEM/EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Nanoparticle size varied from 20 to 100 nm and its surface area was in the range of 25–30 m2g−1. The present study examined its structure before and after kinetic experiments. Kinetic experiments indicated that adsorption of heavy metals [Pb (II), Cd (II), and Cu (II)] and TCE is very rapid during the initial step which is followed by a much slower second step. Removal rates of 99.7% for Pb (II), 99.2% for Cd (II), 99.9% for Cu (II), and 99.9% for TCE were achieved in less than 180 minutes. Lagergren models (LM), liquid film diffusion model (LFDM), and interparticle diffusion model (IDM) were used to understand the removal mechanism associated with nanofer ZVI. In this study, interactions of nanofer ZVI with individual metals as well as TCE are examined.},

abstract = {The atomic-scale microstructure and electron emission properties of boron and sulfur (denoted as B-S) codoped diamond films grown on high-temperature and high-pressure (HTHP) diamond and Si substrates were investigated using atom force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and current imaging tunneling spectroscopy (CITS) measurement techniques. The films grown on Si consisted of large grains with secondary nucleation, whereas those on HTHP diamond are composed of well-developed polycrystalline facets with an average size of 10-50 nm. SIMS analyses confirmed that sulfur was successfully introduced into diamond films, and a small amount of boron facilitated sulfur incorporation into diamond. Large tunneling currents were observed at some grain boundaries, and the emission character was better at the grain boundaries than that at the center of the crystal. The films grown on HTHP diamond substrates were much more perfect with higher quality than the films deposited on Si substrates. The local I-V characteristics for films deposited on Si or HTHP diamond substrates indicate n-type conduction.},

abstract = {We propose a  hierarchy of two-level
kinetic Monte Carlo
methods for  sampling high-dimensional, stochastic lattice particle dynamics
with complex interactions. The method is based on the efficient
coupling of different spatial resolution levels, taking advantage of the low sampling
cost in a coarse space and developing local reconstruction strategies from coarse-grained dynamics. Furthermore, a
natural extension to a multilevel kinetic coarse-grained Monte Carlo is presented.
Microscopic reconstruction
corrects possibly significant errors introduced through coarse-graining,  leading to the
controlled-error approximation of the sampled stochastic process.
In this manner, the proposed  algorithm overcomes known shortcomings of coarse-graining
of particle systems with complex interactions such as combined long- and short-range particle
interactions and/or complex lattice geometries.
Specifically, we provide error analysis   for the approximation of long-time stationary dynamics in terms
of relative entropy,
measuring the information loss
of the path measures per unit time. We show that this observable  either can be estimated a priori,
or it can be tracked computationally a posteriori in the course of a simulation.
The stationary regime is of critical importance to molecular simulations as it is  relevant to
long-time sampling, obtaining phase diagrams,  and in studying metastability properties of high-dimensional complex systems.
Finally, the multilevel nature of the method
provides  flexibility  in combining rejection-free and null-event implementations, generating a hierarchy of algorithms
with an adjustable number of rejections that includes  well-known rejection-free and null-event algorithms.},

In this study, a multiple characterization technique of ultrathin ZrO2 films, deposited on high mobility substrates such as strained-Si (s-Si) and p-type Ge (p-Ge) by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), is presented. For reasons of comparison ZrO2 films on p-type Si (p-Si) where also studied. The stoichiometry, chemical composition and valence band electronic structure are characterized by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). For p-Si and s-Si substrates the ZrO2 valence band edge is found at 2.4 0.2eV while for the p-Ge substrate, the valence band edge is found at 2.6 0.2eV. Furthermore, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements reveal that, all tested samples are in general smooth (0.2-0.3nm roughness) and uniform. MOS capacitive structures were fabricated, using Al as a gate metal, and characterized electrically through C-V and G-V measurements. The typical behavior of a MOS structure has been revealed.

The samples are fabricated on GaAs (100) by metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOCVD). The insertion layers are GaP and GaP/InGaP. The insertion layer thickness affects the shape, density, size distribution and photoluminescence emission of InP QD. The GaP/InGaP samples are attributed to the best size distribution and photoluminescence intensity and line-width A comparison of ultra-thin insertion layers (GaP and GaP/In0.4Ga0.6P) on InP self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) grown on GaAs (001) substrates using metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) was studied. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoluminescence (PL) were employed to characterize the optical and structural properties of the grown InP QDs. It is found that the QD dimension, size distribution and density strongly depend on the insertion layer thickness which led to tune the emission wavelength and narrowing of full width at half maximum (FWHM) at low temperature (20-250K) and at room-temperature PL measurements. This result is attributed to the improved QD size and quantum confinement effect arising from the insertion of the GaP and GaP/In0.4Ga0.6P layers.},

The augmented extremum graph captures both topological and geometric information of the scalar field and enables robust and computationally efficient detection of symmetry. We apply the proposed method to detect symmetries in cryo-electron microscopy datasets and the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of detecting symmetry even in the presence of significant noise. We describe novel applications that use the detected symmetry to enhance visualization of scalar field data and facilitate their exploration.},

Robust image segmentation method and feature extraction algorithm are developed to obtain the features of the hole, the glass tube and the dispensing needle. Visual servo control is employed to achieve accurate aligning for the tube and the hole.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for simultaneously tracking thousands of targets in biological image sequences, which is of major importance in modern biology. The complexity and inherent randomness of the problem lead us to propose a unified probabilistic framework for tracking biological particles in microscope images. The framework includes realistic models of particle motion and existence and of fluorescence image features. For the track extraction process per se, the very cluttered conditions motivate the adoption of a multiframe approach that enforces tracking decision robustness to poor imaging conditions and to random target movements. We tackle the large-scale nature of the problem by adapting the multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm to the proposed framework, resulting in a method with a favorable tradeoff between the model complexity and the computational cost of the tracking procedure. When compared to the state-of-the-art tracking techniques for bioimaging, the proposed algorithm is shown to be the only method providing high-quality results despite the critically poor imaging conditions and the dense target presence. We thus demonstrate the benefits of advanced Bayesian tracking techniques for the accurate computational modeling of dynamical biological processes, which is promising for further developments in this domain.},

abstract = {Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles are widely used for controlled delivery of bioactive agents in therapeutic applications. These nanoparticles show bioavailability, better encapsulation, controlled release, biocompatibility, and in vivo biodegradability. This paper reports a novel approach to synthesize porous PLGA nanoparticles and their use as controlled release vehicles. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) loaded PLGA nanoparticles (porous and nonporous) were synthesized using water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion method. Specifically, PLGA nanoparticles were prepared using chloroform and polyvinyl alcohol, and freeze drying was employed for the phase separation to obtain the nanoparticles. The porous nanoparticles were prepared through the salt-leaching process where sodium bicarbonate was used as an extractable porogen. In vitro drug release behavior of porous and nonporous nanoparticles was monitored over a period of 30&nbsp;days. A much more enhanced BSA release was observed in case of porous polymeric nanoparticles when compared to nonporous nanoparticles. The characterization was done using laser scattering, zeta potential analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The drug loading efficiencies for BSA in porous and nonporous PLGA nanoparticles were 65.50% and 77.59%, respectively. Over a period of 30&nbsp;days, the cumulative BSA released from PLGA porous and nonporous nanoparticles were measured to be 87.41% and 59.91%, respectively. The synthesis of porous nanoparticles with this novel, rapid, and inexpensive method opens a new horizon of using a wide range of cheap and easily-accessible water-soluble salts that can be extracted through leaching process to introduce porous morphology on the nanoparticle surfaces. The porous nanoparticles can have useful applications in controlled drug delivery systems.},

Moreover, piezoelectric properties of nanostructural materials can be tuned to meet specific application needs. Nanocrystalline ZnO as well as Cu-doped ZnO was synthesized in our laboratory. Synthesis of samples with dopant concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 atomic% was carried out. Post-synthesis calcinations of these ceramic oxides at 100&nbsp;°C and 300&nbsp;°C resulted in formation of nanocrystalline powders with narrow size distribution. Crystallite size increased from 10 to 70&nbsp;nm when calcination temperature rose from 100&nbsp;°C to 700&nbsp;°C for undoped ZnO. Nanorods of ZnO could be clearly seen in SEM and AFM images. Dimensions were found to be 10&nbsp;nm diameter and 100&nbsp;nm length at temperature below 300&nbsp;°C. SEM results revealed that in the case of doped ZnO, the crystallite size varied with increase in dopant concentration. After ascertaining crystallographic phase purity and completing necessary characterization by powder XRD, SEM, and AFM, piezoelectric response of these samples in pellet form was studied at nanometric scale using scanning probe microscopy.

This paper carries out a study performed on the observed changes in dimensions of LAO patterns made on HOPG and FLG over several days, pointing to the dynamics of these LAO patterns. The stability of the LAO patterns on HOPG is compared with that for FLG. LAO patterns on HOPG show a widening and reduction in depth over a day. LAO patterns on FLG show, in contrast, a random variation in the lateral dimension “width” and stabilization in the vertical dimension “depth” over several days.},

abstract = {Contextual information has been widely used as a rich source of information to segment multiple objects in an image. A contextual model uses the relationships between the objects in a scene to facilitate object detection and segmentation. Using contextual information from different objects in an effective way for object segmentation, however, remains a difficult problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called multiclass multiscale (MCMS) series contextual model, which uses contextual information from multiple objects and at different scales for learning discriminative models in a supervised setting. The MCMS model incorporates cross-object and inter-object information into one probabilistic framework and thus is able to capture geometrical relationships and dependencies among multiple objects in addition to local information from each single object present in an image. We demonstrate that our MCMS model improves object segmentation performance in electron microscopy images and provides a coherent segmentation of multiple objects. Through speeding up the segmentation process, the proposed method will allow neurobiologists to move beyond individual specimens and analyze populations paving the way for understanding neurodegenerative diseases at the microscopic level.},

abstract = {In this paper, a simple and low-cost fabrication method is demonstrated to make superhydrophobic and superoleophobic Aluminum (Al) surfaces. The Al surfaces have hierarchical structures mimicking the lotus leaf. The manufacturing process is easily performed via grinding, acid etching, and low surface tension chemical coating, in sequence. The wettability of the fabricated Al surfaces is characterized with several liquids having different surface tension energy such as water, diiodomethane, and hexadecane. The effects of grinding and acid etching on wettability are also investigated to enhance the superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity of the Al surface. The grinding process makes the surface rough effectively and improves the wetting behavior. Especially, the ground sample prepared with a sandpaper of P1000 grade shows the highest static contact angle and lowest sliding angle among the fabricated samples. Even though the wetting properties are generally improved by increasing the acid etching time, the repellency of the liquids on the surface is saturated at 10min of acid etching time. The morphology difference of Al surfaces is characterized by measurement of field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The hierarchical micro/nanostructures combined with chemical coating enable the Al surface to be superhydrophobic and superoleophobic.},

abstract = {In this work we present the fabrication and theoretical simulation for a new device constituted by a on Substrate Plasmonic Antenna (SPA) combined with a bio-functionalized Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) cantilever. This device could represent a new strategy to sequence and analyze a single protein or DNA. The idea is to use an SPA composed of an innovative ''wedding cake'' shaped grating (WCG), in order to excite a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) mode, and a 30^o tilted Plasmonic Antenna (PA), able to compress adiabatically the SPP until the tip. The Plasmonic device is placed inside an electrical contact that could be used to unfold protein molecules or DNA. A bio-functionalized AFM tip can be used to fish a single biological element and for alignment with the SPA. Then the unfolded element could be scanned close to the PA and a Tip Enhanced Raman Signal (TERS) can be recorded from the biomolecule. The spatial resolution is limited by the size of the radius of curvature of the antenna, which in this work is about 15nm, while the vertical scanning is controlled by the piezoelectric of the AFM set up. In this work we demonstrate the possibility to fabricate this innovative plasmonic device and we report FDTD simulations of the innovative WCG. The FDTD simulations show the generation of a plasmonic mode that, coupled with the antenna, give rise to an adiabatic compression which produce an increase of the electric field of about 40times.},

The keratocytes were harvested through primary culture from Hpsophrys nicaraguensis (a fish). Live cell imaging was used to record the migration trajectory and the morphology changes. Moreover, galvanotaxis, the tendency of cells directed by an electrical field was studied. Without the electrical field, random pattern was observed in the 2D micro-channel. When the electrical field was applied, the keratocytes in 3D gelatin bubbles migrated along the rim of bubbles and went across the interconnecting pore between the adjacent bubbles, causing the tortuous trajectory of migration patterns. However, in the 2D micro-channel, the keratocytes' migration paths are closer to straight lines. The speed and velocity of keratocytes for both 2D and 3D environment were also compared under the condition with electric field. We believe that the understanding of the keratocytes' migration behavior in 2D and 3D condition under electric field will provide valuable information in succeeding the model system of wound repairs and electrophysiological environment in vivo.},

abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to develop and verify simple but effective model for elastic properties of a porous aluminium foam system and to compare results received from experimental micromechanics with solutions given by analytical or more advanced numerical methods. The material is characterized by a closed pore system with very thin but microscopically inhomogeneous pore walls (~0.1mm) and large air pores (~2.9mm). Therefore, two material levels can be distinguished. The lower level of the proposed model contains inhomogeneous solid matter of the foam cell walls produced from an aluminium melted with admixtures. Elastic parameters as well as volume fractions of microstructural material phases at this level are assessed with nanoindentation and effective properties computed via analytical and numerical homogenization schemes. The effective Young's modulus of the cell walls was found close to 70GPa irrespective to the used homogenization procedure. The higher model scale contains homogenized cell walls and a significant volume fraction of air voids (91.4%). Since analytical schemes fail to predict effective properties of this highly porous structure, numerical homogenization based on a simple two dimensional finite element model is utilized. The model geometry is based on foam optical images from which an equivalent beam structure is produced using Voronoi tessellation. Effective foam Young's modulus was found to be 1.36-1.38GPa which is in relation with ~1.45GPa obtained from uniaxial compression experiments.},

Accordingly, the present study proposes a laser-based microscope system in which a precise autofocusing capability is achieved using a position feedback signal based on the distance L between the geometrical center (Xc, Yc) of the image captured by the CCD sensor and the centroid (xcentroid, ycentroid) of the image. The experimental results show that the proposed system has a positioning accuracy of 2.2 μm and a response time of 1 s given a working range of 200 μm. The autofocusing performance of the proposed system is thus better than that of a conventional centroid-based system, which typically achieves a positioning accuracy of around 5.2 μm.},

We present B\"{u}tschli water-in-oil droplets as a model for further investigation into the development of a technology with living properties. Otto B\"{u}tschli first described the system in 1898, when he used alkaline water droplets in olive oil to initiate a saponification reaction. This simple recipe produced structures that moved and exhibited characteristics that resembled, at least superficially, the amoeba. We reconstructed the B\"{u}tschli system and observed its life span under a light microscope, observing chemical patterns and droplet behaviors in nearly three hundred replicate experiments. Self-organizing patterns were observed, and during this dynamic, embodied phase the droplets provided a means of introducing temporal and spatial order in the system with the potential for chemical programmability. The authors propose that the discrete formation of dynamic droplets, characterized by their lifelike behavior patterns, during a variable window of time from 30 s to 30 min after the addition of alkaline water to the oil phase, qualify this system as an example of living technology. The analysis of the B\"{u}tschli droplets suggests that a set of conditions may precede the emergence of lifelike characteristics and exemplifies the richness of this rudimentary chemical system, not only for artificial life investigations but also for possible real-world applications in architectural practice.},

abstract = {We present an approach for fabricating customized, replaceable tips for scanning probe microscopy of critical dimension and high aspect ratio structures. The tips are designed using in-plane nanofabrication, and subsequently folded out of plane to be accessible for micromanipulation onto scanning probe cantilevers. These tips, which we term ''nanobits'', are fabricated with in-plane focused ion beam (FIB) milling, which allows aspect ratios of up to 10 in combination with tip radius of curvature down to 5-10nm. While definition of side-tips, double-tips and other application-specific tip shapes is trivial, the use of in-plane FIB milling to define the tip shape, requires that the nanobits are subsequently turned 90^o out of plane to promote insertion into a cantilever probe for scanning. We compare here two different approaches towards such out-of-plane bending of nanobits: bilayer stress by deposition of a thin layer of metal or by direct exposure to ion beam. We find that the nanobits made in 100nm and 200nm Si"xN"y membranes tend to bend under FIB irradiation at similar residual thicknesses. In contrast to previously published results our approach suggests a way to eliminate the need for complex manipulation via microgrippers, so that the scanning probe cantilever can be used directly to pick up or to replace the scanning probe tip.},

abstract = {We report for the first time synthesis of high-density arrays of vertically well-aligned cobalt monosilicide (CoSi) nanowires (NWs) in a large area via a solid-state reaction. The vertical arrays of 1-μm-long Si NWs were first grown on a $p$-type (1&nbsp;0&nbsp;0) Si substrate by the aqueous electroless etching (AEE) method, and a 40-nm-thick Co layer was conformally deposited using a thermal atomic layer deposition system as revealed by SEM and transmission electron microscope analyses. The rapid thermal annealing process was carried out at various temperatures ranging from 700 to 1000&nbsp;°C; the X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that the polycrystalline CoSi NW arrays were formed at temperatures above 900&nbsp;°C. The required high driving force for this silicide formation can be attributed to the significant amounts of oxygen-related contaminants at the defect sites of the highly rough surfaces of AEE-grown Si NWs. To demonstrate practical applications, field emitters and Schottky diodes were fabricated using the vertically aligned CoSi NW arrays. The field emission measurements showed a turn-on field of 10.9&nbsp;V/μm and a field enhancement factor of 328, indicating the feasibility of vertically aligned CoSi NW arrays as promising field emitters. For the Schottky diodes, the measured Schottky barrier height was 0.52&nbsp;eV and the estimated ideality factor obtained from the I–V characteristic curves was 2.28.},

Morphologically we observe grain boundaries developing into small gaps creating a network of insulating material running across the entire surface. We also observe decoration of the grain boundaries with some highly conductive particles which based on the TEM observations correspond to TaN clusters which apparently are formed during the crystallization. Increased leakage is observed by C-AFM at the edges of the crystalline grains consistent with the TEM observation of a reduction in thickness and a less ordered crystalline lattice for the Ta2O5.

Dielectric breakdown (BD) in polycrystalline HfO2/SiO2 gate stacks has been studied using a conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) technique, which allows employing a nanosize probe to apply a highly localized electrical stress. The resulting BD statistics indicate that BD preferentially occurs in the interfacial SiO2 (IL) layer beneath the grain boundaries (GBs) of the overlaying polycrystalline HfO2 film due to higher conductivity of the GB compared to that of the grains.},

Their surface free energy characteristics and adhesive and friction forces were investigated using an atomic force microscope. The interactions between the lubricant molecules and the water molecules were also examined by monitoring the changes in the contact angle of distilled water on the test lubricant films. The interactive forces such as the adhesive and friction forces of a film that is approximately one monolayer thick were found to be strongly dependent on the conformation of the lubricant molecules on diamond-like carbon thin films. In addition, the TA-30 and QA-40 lubricant molecules appeared to interact with the water molecules more actively than conventional Ztetraol2000 molecules. These results afforded fundamental insight into the tribological performance of novel branched PFPE lubricants in the head-disk interface.},

Two-dimensional particles size estimation with the Zetasizer is highly inaccurate. Optical method of characterization of nanoplates has been developed and validated. In the recent years, two-dimensional nanoparticles (the nanoplates) have become a subject of intense scientific researches and industrial applications. The liquid exfoliation of layered crystals becomes the most simple and efficient manufacturing method of graphene and layered compounds nanosheets. The primary product of the liquid exfoliation is a lyosol - a colloidal suspension of desired nanoparticles in a fluid. The shape of the produced nanoparticles may be determined with the use of an electron microscopy (SEM). In the case of spherical particles the concentration and the particles size can be assessed by the light absorption and the dynamic laser light scattering (DLS) measurements respectively.We propose an optical method for fast and comprehensive characterization of shape and size of nanoplates in a lyosol. The system makes use of an optical goniometer. It allows to measure angular distribution of intensity of the light scattered on the lyosol sample. The distribution of the intensity (indicatrix) depends on the shape and size of the nanoparticles. We developed a method of theoretical indicatrix calculation of the nanoplates with the use of Amsterdam Discrete Dipole Approximation method. The experimentally measured indicatrix is compared with the theoretical calculations (standardized indicatrices). We observed that the nanoplate has a dual character of light scattering. It can scatter light as a "small" or "big" particle according to the direction of the incident light beam. We have applied the proposed method of characterization for a water suspension of graphene nanosheets. Results of the measurements are in good agreement with particles dimensions assessed with the SEM images and do not fit with the graphene dimensions estimated with the DLS method. It leads to a conclusion that the two-dimensional particles size estimation with the DLS is highly inaccurate.},

Step-down interference structure based on double layer antireflection coating was used. Two maximum transmittance peaks around 440nm and 760nm could be seen. About 11% and 3% reduction in reflectance compared to bare ITO alone were achieved. Stable properties of antireflective TCO against annealing temperature achieved. A thermally stable multilayered transparent conducting oxide utilizing nanocomposite ZnO:TiO2 antireflection thin film (arc-ZnO:TiO2) on an indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrate has been prepared by radio frequency-magnetron sputtering. The effects of post-deposition annealing on the morphological, structural, optical and electrical properties were investigated with the aim to find the best conditions for the antireflection substrate. The X-ray diffraction behaviors of mixed type crystalline structures preferred at 222] and 101] between ITO and ZnO were observed, respectively. The grain size increased from 37.9nm to 46.9nm due to the aggregation of smaller grain during the annealing process. Average transmittances of approximately 82% were observed for all the samples in the range between 440nm and 760nm. A corresponding reduction in the reflectance of about 11% and 3% compared to bare ITO was achieved. The refractive index increased from 1.82 up to 2.0 due to the change in the packing density. For all ranges of annealing conditions, the arc-ZnO:TiO2 layers conserved the low resistivity of ITO at 1.96\'{\i} 10-4 . In other words, the oxygen consumed in the annealing process improved the crystallinity of the film without much change to the resistivity of the ITO-based substrate. The increment of the root mean square roughness from 2.12nm to 3.21nm evidenced by the atomic force microscopy analysis was supported by the increment of grain growth.},

Magnetic properties were measured by using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). In calculation, electronic structure and magnetic properties for pure ZnO and Zn1-xMnxO have been investigated by means of the first principle calculations based on local density approximation (LDA) and LDA+U scheme, packaged in the ABINIT code. The calculation was performed using self-consistent projected augmented plane wave (PAW).

Surface acoustic wave sensors (SAWSs) with nanoporous palladium (Pd) sensing material for hydrogen (H2) detection are reported. We fabricated sensors with a stable and fast response and with a high sensitivity for detecting H2 even at room temperature (RT). The fabricated sensors were 'delay line' type (quartz substrate, ~70MHz central frequency). The nanoporous sensitive layer was directly deposited onto a quartz substrate using the picosecond laser ablation method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to investigate the influence of different experimental conditions, such as laser power density and inert gas pressure, on the morphological proprieties of Pd thin films.

The most interesting alternative to replace visual observation under classical microscopy is based on the use of near infrared reflectance microscopy (NIRM). This technique collects spectral information from a set of microscopic particles of animal feeds. These spectra can be classified using maximum margin classifiers with good results. However, it is difficult to interpret the models in terms of the contribution of features. To gain insight into the interpretability of such classifications, we propose a method that learns accurate classifiers defined on a small set of narrow intervals of wavelengths. The proposed method is a greedy bipartite procedure that may be successfully compared with other state-of-the-art feature selectors and can be scaled up efficiently to deal with other classification tasks of higher dimensionality.},

abstract = {During the last decades it has been shown that the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) can be used in non-contact mode as an efficient lithographic technique capable of manufacturing nanometer sized devices on the surface of a silicon wafer. The AFM nanooxidation approach is based on generating a potential difference between a cantilever needle tip and a silicon wafer. A water meniscus builds up between the tip and the wafer, resulting in a medium for oxyions to move due to the high electric field in the region. A simulator for nanooxidation with a non-contact AFM, implemented in a Level Set environment, was developed. The presented simulator implements the growth of thicker oxides by analyzing the potential, electric field, and ion concentrations at the ambient/oxide and oxide/silicon interfaces, while the growth of thin oxides assumes a single liquid/silicon interface, which is modeled as an infinitely long conducting plane. The nanodot shapes have been shown to follow the electric field and hence the surface charge distribution shape; therefore, a Monte Carlo particle distribution for the surface charge density is generated for two-dimensional and three-dimensional topography simulations in a Level Set framework.},

abstract = {Innovations in the fields of medicine and medical image processing are becoming increasingly important. Historically, RNA viruses produced in cell cultures have been identified using electron microscopy, in which virus identification is performed by eye. Such an approach is time consuming and depends on manual controls. Moreover, detailed knowledge about RNA viruses is required. This study introduces the Entropy-Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (Entropy-ANFIS method), which can be used to automatically detect RNA virus images. This system consists of four stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and testing the Entropy-ANFIS method with respect to the correct classification ratio. In the pre-processing stage, a center-edge changing method is used, in which the Euclidian distances are calculated from the center pixels to the edges of the imaged object. In this way, the distance vector is obtained. This calculation is repeated for each RNA virus image. In feature extraction, stage norm entropy, logarithmic energy and threshold entropy values are calculated to form the feature vector. The obtained feature vector is independent of the rotation and scale of the RNA virus image. In the classification stage, the feature vector is given as input to the ANFIS classifier, ANN classifier and FCM cluster. Finally, the test stage is performed to evaluate the correct classification ratio of the Entropy-ANFIS algorithm for the RNA virus images. The correct classification ratio has been determined as 95.12% using the proposed Entropy-ANFIS method.},

abstract = {Multi- and hyperspectral imaging and data analysis has been investigated in the last decades in the context of various fields of application like remote sensing or microscopic spectroscopy. However, recent developments in sensor technology and a growing number of application areas require a more generic view on data analysis, that clearly expands the current, domain-specific approaches. In this context, we address the problem of interactive exploration of multi- and hyperspectral data, consisting of (semi-)automatic data analysis and scientific visualization in a comprehensive fashion. In this paper, we propose an approach that enables a generic interactive exploration and easy segmentation of multi- and hyperspectral data, based on characterizing spectra of an individual dataset, the so-called endmembers. Using the concepts of existing endmember extraction algorithms, we derive a visual analysis system, where the characteristic spectra initially identified serve as input to interactively tailor a problem-specific visual analysis by means of visual exploration. An optional outlier detection improves the robustness of the endmember detection and analysis. An adequate system feedback of the costly unmixing procedure for the spectral data with respect to the current set of endmembers is ensured by a novel technique for progressive unmixing and view update which is applied at user modification. The progressive unmixing is based on an efficient prediction scheme applied to previous unmixing results. We present a detailed evaluation of our system in terms of confocal Raman microscopy, common multispectral imaging and remote sensing.},

abstract = {Integrating artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) is an effective approach to modeling, simulating, and intervening real complex systems. Emergency response is an important issue in the operation of urban rail transport systems for ensuring the safety of people and property. Inspired by the ACP method, this paper introduces a basic framework of parallel control and management (PCM) for emergency response of urban rail transportation systems. The proposed framework is elaborated from three interdependent aspects: Points, Lines, and Networks. Points represent the modeling of urban rail stations, Lines describe the microscopic characteristics of urban rail connections between designated stations, and Networks present the macroscopic properties of all the urban rail connections. Based on the given framework, a series of parallel experiments, which were impossible to achieve in real systems, can now be conducted in the constructed artificial system. Furthermore, the constructed artificial system can be used to test and develop effective emergency control and management strategies for real rail transport systems. Therefore, this proposed framework will be able to enhance the reliability, security, robustness, and maneuverability of urban rail transport systems in case of an emergency.},

abstract = {Motivation:  Tracing of neuron morphology is an essential technique in computational neuroscience. However, despite a number of existing methods, few open-source techniques are completely or sufficiently automated and at the same time are able to generate robust results for real 3D microscopy images.  Results:  We developed all-path-pruning 2.0 (APP2) for 3D neuron tracing. The most important idea is to prune an initial reconstruction tree of a neuron’s morphology using a long-segment-first hierarchical procedure instead of the original termini-first-search process in APP. To further enhance the robustness of APP2, we compute the distance transform of all image voxels directly for a gray-scale image, without the need to binarize the image before invoking the conventional distance transform. We also design a fast-marching algorithm-based method to compute the initial reconstruction trees without pre-computing a large graph. This method allows us to trace large images. We bench-tested APP2 on ~700 3D microscopic images and found that APP2 can generate more satisfactory results in most cases than several previous methods.

The detection of the crypt inner boundary is performed using the closing morphological hierarchy. The disadvantages of this approach related to the execution time and the used memory are highlighted and the morphological pyramid is used instead due to its computational efficiency, the reduced amount of used memory and the increased robustness. An analysis of the two approaches is performed considering the number of processed pixels, the used memory and the complexity. The outer border is determined by the epithelial nuclei overlapped by the maximal isoline of the inner boundary. The percentage of the mis-segmented nuclei against epithelial nuclei per crypt is used to evaluate the proposed methods. The limitations are described in order to highlight the situations in which the current approaches do not provide suitable results.},

In addition, sulphated and non-sulphated oxidized hyaluronan were immobilized on bare substrates and micrometric features of cell adhesive and non-adhesive proteins were patterned by microcontact printing on top of them. The obtained structures were characterized by optical microscopy, profilometry and atomic force microscopy. The stability of structures was tested by immersion in physiological salt solutions.

In the area of image reconstruction, researchers often desire to compare two or more reconstruction techniques and assess their relative merits. SNARK09 provides a uniform framework to implement algorithms and evaluate their performance. It has been designed to treat both parallel and divergent projection geometries and can either create test data (with or without noise) for use by reconstruction algorithms or use data collected by another software or a physical device. A number of frequently-used classical reconstruction algorithms are incorporated. The package provides a means for easy incorporation of new algorithms for their testing, comparison and evaluation. It comes with tools for statistical analysis of the results and ten worked examples.},

abstract = {Motivation:  Microscopy advances have enabled the acquisition of large  - scale biological images that capture whole tissues  in situ . This in turn has fostered the study of spatial relationships between cells and various biological structures  ,  which has proved enormously beneficial toward understanding organ and organism function. However  ,  the unique nature of biological images and tissues precludes the application of many existing spatial mining and quantification methods necessary to make inferences about the data. Especially difficult is attempting to quantify the spatial correlation between heterogeneous structures and point objects  ,  which often occurs in many biological tissues.  Results:  We develop a method to quantify the spatial correlation between a continuous structure and point data in large (17 500 \texttimes{} 17 500 pixel) biological images. We use this method to study the spatial relationship between the vasculature and a type of cell in the retina called astrocytes. We use a geodesic feature space based on vascular structures and embed astrocytes into the space by spatial sampling. We then propose a quantification method in this feature space that enables us to empirically demonstrate that the spatial distribution of astrocytes is often correlated with vascular structure. Additionally  ,  these patterns are conserved in the retina after injury. These results prove the long  - assumed patterns of astrocyte spatial distribution and provide a novel methodology for conducting other spatial studies of similar tissue and structures.

We show how a set of quasitopological functions defined within DM can be mapped to specific operators defined in mathematical morphology (MM) and easily implemented in scientific image processing programs. These functions provide the means to model topological properties of individual regions and spatial relations between them such as contact, overlap, and the relation of part to whole. DM not only extends the expressive power of image processing applications where mathematical morphology is used, but by functioning as a logic it also supplies the formal basis with which to prove the correctness of implemented algorithms as well as providing the computational basis to mechanically reason about segmented digital images using automated reasoning programs. In particular, we show how DM can supply a model-based and algorithmic context to the otherwise blind pixel-based image processing routines still dominating conventional imaging approaches. A number of worked examples drawn from the histological domain are given, including segmentation of cells in culture, identifying basal cell layers from stratified epithelia sections, and cell sorting in blood smears.},

In this article, we have demonstrated the fabrication of flexible LGP using CO2 laser LIGA-like technology which includes the laser ablation of micro-groove polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) master mold, pouring polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to the mold and casting the micro-groove microstructure for flexible LGP application. Different laser powers and micro-groove pitches were used to ablate the PMMA mold with varied groove depths and taper angles. Optical microscope was used to examine the morphology and profile of the final bendable LGP microstructure. Under the varied laser power of 1---12 W, the mean taper angles of PMMA micro-grooves ranged from 28° to 70° and the etching depths were from 44.5 to 281.8 μm. The flexible PDMS LGP had good microstructure duplication after casting. The optical uniformity and luminance of flexible LGP was concerned with structure of micro-grooves and measured using BM9 luminance meter.

abstract = {Automatic localization and targeting are critical steps in automating the process of microinjecting adherent cells. This process is currently performed manually by highly trained operators and is characterized as a laborious task with low success rate. Therefore, automation is desired to increase the efficiency and consistency of the operations. This research offers a contribution to this procedure through the development of a vision system for a robotic microinjection setup. Its goals are to automatically locate adherent cells in a culture dish and target them for a microinjection. Here the major concern was the achievement of an error-free targeting system to guarantee high consistency in microinjection experiments. To accomplish this, a novel visual targeting algorithm integrating different image processing techniques was proposed. This framework employed defocusing microscopy to highlight cell features and improve cell segmentation and targeting reliability. Three main image processing techniques, operating at three different focus levels in a bright field (BF) microscope, were used: an anisotropic contour completion (ACC) method, a local intensity variation background-foreground classifier, and a grayscale threshold-based segmentation. The proposed framework combined information gathered by each of these methods using a validation map and this was shown to provide reliable cell targeting results. Experiments conducted with sets of real images from two different cell lines (CHO-K1 and HEK), which contained a total of more than 650 cells, yielded flawless targeting results along with a cell detection ratio greater than 50%.},

Similarly, the average internal pore diameter of both SWNT buckypapers was found to be smaller than that of their MWNT counterparts, after analysis of binding isotherms derived fromnitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements performed on the materials. All four buckypaper membranes examined were found to be &gt;99% effective for removing Escherichia coli (E. coli) from aqueous suspensions. However, buckypapers containing ciprofloxacin outperformed their counterparts containing the surfactant. BothMWNT buckypapers were more effective at preventing passage of E. coli than their analogues containing SWNTs, while fluorescence microscopic examination of stained membrane surfaces demonstrated that buckypapers composed of SWNTs had greater bactericidal properties.},

abstract = {Primary brain tumors refer to those developing from the various types of cells that compose the brain. Gliomas represent about 50% of all primary brain tumors and include a variety of different histological tumor types and malignancy grades. The World Health Organization WHO classifies gliomas into four histological types and four grades. The goal of molecular classification using advanced pattern recognition tools is to identify subgroups of tumors with distinct biological and clinical features and initiate the challenge of classifying complex gliomas of similar histology and malignancy status into distinct categories. The aim of this paper is to i present the measurement procedures and analysis methodologies, ii summarize the currently available knowledge related to the utilization of 'omics' measurements in the discrimination of brain gliomas, and iii provide a scientific basis for future medical practice in the discrimination and treatment of brain gliomas based specifically on the metabolic process of glycolysis. In particular, the paper explores the idea of the glycolysis pathway as a critical concept for the development of therapeutic strategies for brain gliomas.},

abstract = {A good Ag-based SERS substrate has been prepared by one-pot reaction using methyl cellulose as a template. Effects of methyl cellulose concentration, silver ammonia chloride solution concentration, reaction duration, and reducing agent on silver nanoparticles were discussed in this paper. The performance of the obtained Ag nanoparticles was characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Results show that the reducing agent plays a crucial role in the performance of silver nanoparticles. Optimum preparation conditions of synthesis of SERS substrates were as follows: 10mM silver ammonia chloride and 0.2% MC at 75°C, reducing in 0.2% reducing agent at 120 min. TEM studies reveal that particles are mostly spherical and rod in shape with an average size of 80 nm. Silver nanoparticles prepared with MC as a template have been shown to provide strong SERS enhancement signals of R6G, which can be used as a good Ag-based SERS substrate in the analytical environment for routine measurements.},

The products are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS), respectively. The results show that the hybrid TiO2@yeast-carbon microspheres have ordered elliptic shapes of uniform size (length = 3.5 ± 0.3 µm; width = 2.5 ± 0.5 µm). UV-VIS ascertains that the as-prepared microspheres possess an obvious light response in a wide range of 250-400 nm. In the decomposition of typical model pollutants including methylene blue and congo red, the hybrid composites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for the methylene blue due to the enhanced adsorption ability. Further investigation reveals that the combined effect of adsorption from the yeast-carbon core and photocatalytic degradation from the attached TiO2 nanoparticles were responsible for the improvement of the photocatalytic activities. Hereby, the raspberry-like TiO2@yeast-carbon has promising applications in water purification.},

Fresh bovine cortical bones were drilled via vibrational and conventional ways. Drilling operations were performed by a dynamic material testing machine, which can provide the vibration while maintaining uniform feed motion. The drill site and bone debris were observed through scanning electron microscope (SEM). The experimental results showed that fewer and shorter micro-cracks were formed in vibrational drilling than those formed in conventional way. And the surface morphology of bone debris fromtwo different drilling ways was also quite different. It is expected that vibrational drilling in orthopedic surgery operation could decrease the microdamage to the bone, which could lower the incidence of stress fracture and contribute to the postoperative recovery.},

Their morphologies, water permeability, and pore structures were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. Furthermore, MWCNT/GNP membranes were used to improve the flame retardancy of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites, and the influence of weight percentage of GNPs on the permeability and flame retardancy of MWCNT/GNP membranes was systematically investigated. Results show that incorporation of MWCNT/GNP membranes on CFRP composite plates can remarkably improve the flame retardancy of CFRP composites. Specifically, the incorporation of hierarchical MWCNT/GNP membrane with 7.5 wt% of GNP displays a 35% reduction in the peak heat release rate (PHRR) for a CFRP composite plate with the epoxy as matrix and a 11% reduction in PHRR compared with the incorporation of MWCNT membrane only. A synergistic flame retarding mechanism is suggested to be attributed to these results, which includes controlling the pore size and penetrative network structure.},

XRD results show that as the postannealing temperature increased from 150°C to 500°C, the c-axis orientation becomes stronger. Refractive indices and dielectric constants were calculated on the basis of different relationships by utilizing bandgap values. These bandgap values were obtained in terms of optical absorption by using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The enhancing effects of annealing temperatures on electrical properties were observed in terms of current-to-voltage measurements. Resistivity decreases as postannealing temperature increases from 150°C to 500°C. Annealed samples were evaluated for UV-sensing application. The samples exhibit a responsivity of 1.7A/W.},

After heating, the changes in the morphology and the chemical composition of the metal foils were analyzed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray diffractometer, and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The results of the analysis indicated that the Nb foil showed the minimum adhesion of liquid Ga to the surface while the maximum amount of liquid Ga was observed to adhere to the Ti foil. In addition, the Nb foil was oxidized and the Mo foil was reduced during the heating process. Considering these effects, we conclude that Mo may be used as an alternative encapsulation material for Ga in addition to Nb, which is used as the conventional encapsulation material, due to its chemical resistance against oxidation in hot liquid Ga.},

abstract = {Nanostructured conversion coating of Al-Mg alloy was obtained via the surface treatment with zirconium titanium salt solution at 25°C for 10 min. The zirconium titanium salt solution is composed of tannic acid 1.00 g undefined L-1, K2ZrF6 0.75 g undefined L-1, NaF 1.25g undefined L-1, MgSO4 1.0 g/L, and tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBT) 0.08 g undefined L-1. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) were used to characterize the composition and structure of the obtained conversion coating. The morphology of the conversion coating was obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results exhibit that the zirconium titanium salt conversion coating of Al-Mg alloy contains Ti, Zr, Al, F, O, Mg, C, Na, and so on. The conversion coating with nm level thickness is smooth, uniform, and compact. Corrosion resistance of conversion coating was evaluated in the 3.5 wt.% NaCl electrolyte through polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS). Self-corrosion current density on the nanostructured conversion coating of Al-Mg alloy is 9.7\texttimes{}10-8A undefined cm-2, which is only 2% of that on the untreated aluminum-magnesium alloy. This result indicates that the corrosion resistance of the conversion coating is improved markedly after chemical conversion treatment.},

abstract = {A facile method has been developed to synthesize light-weight CNTs/Fe3O4/PANI nanocomposites. The formation route was proposed as the coprecipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ and an additional process of in situ polymerization of aniline monomer. The structure and morphology of CNTs/Fe3O4/PANI were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The TEM investigation shows that the CNTs/Fe3O4/PANI nanocomposites exhibit less intertwined structure and that many more Fe3O4 particles are attached homogeneously on the surface of CNTs, indicating that PANI can indeed help CNTs to disperse in isolated form. The waveabsorbing properties were investigated in a frequency of 2-18 GHz. The results show that the CNTs/Fe3O4/PANI nanocomposites exhibit a super absorbing behavior and possess a maximum reflection loss of -48 dB at 12.9 GHz, and the bandwidth below -20 dB is more than 5 GHz. More importantly, the absorption peak frequency ranges of the CNTs/Fe3O4/PANI composites can be tuned easily by changing the wax weight ratio and thickness of CNTs/Fe3O4/PANI paraffin wax matrix.},

To observe the morphology, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was utilized to appraise the structure of the synthesized material. The photocatalytic behavior of ZrFe2O5 nano-particles was investigated by measuring the degradation rate of toluidine blue O (TBO) dye in aqueous solution in the presence of ZrFe2O5 nano-particles under visible light irradiation. A steady decrease in absorption peak under visible light irradiation was observed by increasing exposure time. The degradation efficiency was observed as 92% after 140 min of exposure to visible light. Besides, ZrFe2O5 nanophotocatalyst could be recovered and recycled easily. The rate of TBO and total organic carbon (TOC) removal under visible light irradiation decreased by only 5% and 10%, respectively, after seven cycles of use, demonstrating the high photostability of the synthesized nano-photocatalyst material.},

The water uptake, weight loss, and changes in the PBS pH value and in the mechanical properties of material were measured during the processes that PLLA and PLLA/n-HA biological composites were degraded in PBS. We also performed electron microscopic scanning of the material fracture surface and observed the microscopic morphologies of materials during the degradation process. We found that the degradation rate of the PLLA/n-HA material was slower than the PLLA material, and there was a little degradation of the PLLA/n-HA material at early stages. The PLLA/n-HA material also maintained the initial mechanical strength better than the pure PLLA material. The PLLA/n-HA material is thus a better material for artificial bone than the pure PLLA material.},

Through surface modification, water contact angle of the coating prepared by modified kaolin particles increased dramatically from 0° to 152°, and the sliding angle decreased from 90° to 3°. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the surface morphology. A structure composed of micro-nano hierarchical component, combined with the surface modification by aluminate coupling agent which reduced the surface energy greatly, was found to be responsible for the superhydrophobicity. The method adopted is relatively simple, facile, and cost-effective and can potentially be applied to large water-repellent surface coatings.},

Thin films were deposited on quartz glass substrate by using spin coating technique and sintered at 700°C. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) patterns showed that these thin films consist of pure La0.67Ba0.33(Mn1-xAlx)O3 phase where the most prominent peak is observed at (104). All the samples display a rhombohedral structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that aggregation of small particles occurred more in doped films than in undoped films.

abstract = {Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on a TiO2 photoanode have been considered as an alternative source in the field of renewable energy resources. In DSSCs, photoanode plays a key role to achieve excellent photo-to-electric conversion efficiency. The surface morphology, surface area, TiO2 crystal phase, and the dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles are the most important factors influencing the properties of a photoanode. The smooth TiO2 surface morphology of the photoanode indicates closely packed arrangement of TiO2 particles which enhance the light harvesting efficiency of the cell. In this paper, a smooth TiO2 photoanode has been successfully prepared using a well-dispersed anatase TiO2 nanosol via a simple hydrothermal process. The above TiO2 photoanode was then compared with the photoanode made from commercial TiO2 nanoparticle pastes. The morphological and structural analyses of both the aforementioned photoanodes were comprehensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The DSSC fabricated by using a-TiO2 nanosol-based photoelectrode exhibited an overall light conversion efficiency of 7.20% and a short-circuit current density of 13.34mA cm-2, which was significantly higher than those of the DSSCs with the TiO2 nanoparticles-based electrodes.},

A compact granular morphology is observed for the ZnO samples without polymer. The samples exhibit microparticles of size 100nm for PVP and for PEG-mediated growth, whereas microporous corrugated morphology is observed for added PEG-mediated micropowder.

abstract = {This paper compares between the methods of growing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on diamond substrates and evaluates the quality of the CNTs and the interfacial strength. One potential application for these materials is a heat sink/spreader for high-power electronic devices. The CNTs and diamond substrates have a significantly higher specific thermal conductivity than traditional heat sink/spreader materials making them good replacement candidates. Only limited research has been performed on these CNT/diamond structures and their suitability of different growth methods.This study investigates three potential chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques for growing CNTs on diamond: thermal CVD (T-CVD), microwave plasma-enhanced CVD (MPECVD), and floating catalyst thermal CVD (FCT-CVD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to analyze the morphology and topology of theCNTs. Raman spectroscopy was used to assess the quality of the CNTs by determining the ID/IG peak intensity ratios. Additionally, the CNT/diamond samples were sonicated for qualitative comparisons of the durability of the CNT forests. T-CVD provided the largest diameter tubes, with catalysts residing mainly at the CNT/diamond interface. The MPE-CVD process yielded non uniformdefective CNTs, and FCT-CVD resulted in the smallest diameter CNTs with catalyst particles imbedded throughout the length of the nanotubes.},

The GPs prepared using type A gelatin were positively charged (GP(+), +33mV; size, 180.6 ± 45.7 nm). Water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST)-1 assay showed that both GPs were nontoxic to HCE cells. The fluorescence intensity of HCE cells cultured with cationic GPs conjugated with a fluorescent dye was higher than that of the anionic GP-treated HCE cells. In vivo examination showed no serious irritation to the rabbit eyes. Furthermore, corneal thickness and ocular pressure in the eyes of the treated rabbits were similar to those in the eyes of normal rabbits. Microscopic examination of corneal cryosections showed widely distributed fluorescent nanocarriers, from the anterior to the posterior part of the cornea of the GP(+) group, and higher fluorescence intensity in the GP(+) group was also observed. In conclusion, GPs as cationic colloidal carriers were efficiently adsorbed on the negatively charged cornea without irritating the eyes of the rabbits and can be retained in the cornea for a longer time. Thus, GPs(+) have a great potential as vehicles for ocular drug delivery.},

The crystalline structures and morphologies were characterized by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscope analyses. The Seebeck coefficients, electrical conductivity, and power factor were measured at room temperature. The experimental results showed that both the Seebeck coefficient and power factor were enhanced as the annealing temperature increased.

Biotin connect density of B-CS-NPs and A-BCS-NPs was 2.18 ± 0.36 and 1.26 ± 0.11mol biotin/mol CS, respectively. At relatively low concentration, CS-NPs with higher extent of solidification exhibited more vigorous inhibitory effect against HepG2 cells than those without solidification. When NPs were incubated with cancer cells for 48 h, compared with CS-NPs, the anticancer activity of B-CS-NPs and A-B-CS-NPs was enhanced significantly (P &gt; 0.05). In addition, A-B-CS-NPs showed superior cytotoxicity over B-CS-NPs. This study demonstrates that modification with biotin and avidin may be an efficient way in improving antitumor activity of CS-NPs against hepatic carcinoma.},

Differentmolarity concentration ratio of Zn(NO3)26H2O to CH4N2O, 2 : 1, 1 : 4, 1 : 6, and 1 : 8 is used in this work. The effect of urea concentration used during the synthesis process is discussed. The ZnO nanostructures were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), photoluminescene (PL), and I-V probe. Porous nanoflakes are successfully synthesized on p-type silicon substrate coated with gold layer with different size and dimension. High intensity photoluminescence (PL) at optimum concentration indicated that urea is good stabilizer to produce ZnO nanostructures with good crytallinity. Rectifying characteristics show dramaticaly change in turn-on voltage when the concentration of urea increases in aqueous solution. This is related to the theory about p-type doping of ZnO nanostructures by nitrogen from NH3.},

The morphology and structural properties of the thin films were studied by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) techniques. Electrical resistivity of the thin films was measured using a data acquisition unit. The optical properties of the films were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) technique. X-ray diffraction data showed that the films were grown in the (002) direction with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The average grain size ranged from 15 to 27 nm. Increasing annealing temperatures resulted in larger grain sizes and higher crystallinity, with the surface roughness of annealed films being more than twice if compared to unannealed film. The electrical resistivity of the films decreased with the increasing annealing temperature. TheUVand visible band emissionswere observed in the photoluminescence spectra, due to exciton and defect-related emissions, respectively. The transmission values of the films were as high as 90% within the visible range (400-700 nm).},

abstract = {The Twelfth Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods was held
March 25--30, 2012, in Copper Mountain, Colorado. The meeting featured more
than 150 presentations on a wide
range of topics in scientific computing, including Krylov subspace methods,
preconditioning techniques, multigrid methods, domain decomposition,
graph partitioning, nonlinear solvers, algorithms for eigenvalue
computations, iterative methods in optimization, and so forth.
Similar to other recent Copper Mountain meetings,
several talks dealt with implementation aspects on current
computer architectures, such as GPUs.
Other talks addressed
aspects of discretization methods relevant to iterative
solution. A number of talks covered iterative solution methods
in applications including
compressed sensing, neutronics, incompressible
resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), density functional theory,
radiative transfer, ocean
simulation, image processing, fluid mechanics, electromagnetics,
and many more areas.
One especially encouraging aspect of the 2012 conference was the
very large proportion of student attendees (61 of a total
of 182 participants), which bodes well for the future of the field.Howard Elman (University of Maryland) and Ray Tuminaro (Sandia
National Laboratories) served as conference co-chairs.
This was Howard's
last Copper Mountain Conference as co-chair after having served
in this capacity since the 2004 edition.
On behalf of the entire
Scientific Committee, it is a pleasure to extend to Howard sincere thanks for
his service and exceptional contributions to the success of the
conference over all these years.
Management services were provided by Annette Anthony
of Front Range Scientific Computations, Inc. The Conference
gratefully acknowledges financial support from the U.S. Department of
Energy, IBM, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
Los Alamos National Laboratory,
Sandia National Laboratories, and the U.S. National Science Foundation.
The Copper Mountain Conference is organized in cooperation with the
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). Submissions
to this special section were open to the scientific community, as
advertised in advance on websites of the SIAM Journal of
Scientific Computing and the Copper Mountain Conference.The 23 papers in this section give a broad picture of the field
of iterative methods and related issues in scientific computing.
The variety of topics covered by these papers mirrors the wide
array of fields represented at the conference. There are papers
on Krylov methods (both theory and implementation aspects), papers
on algebraic preconditioners, papers on multigrid methods, papers
addressing the numerical solution of non-standard problems involving
partial differential equations (e.g., with fuzzy coefficients), and
several papers focusing on the use of iterative techniques in applications
ranging from the investigation of the microscopic
world (electronic structure of materials)
to that of the large-scale universe (astronomical imaging). Between
these two extremes we find papers on neutron transport, MHD, radiative
transfer, electromagnetics, incompressible flow, medical imaging,
compressed sensing, finance, and ocean modeling.The guest editorial board worked very hard to insure a rigorous
peer-review process while meeting deadlines. Special thanks are due to
Mitch Chernoff (SIAM Publications Manager) and Brittni
Holland (SIAM Editorial Associate) for their efforts
on this special section.We believe that the papers collected in this special section
demonstrate the ever-increasing role of iterative methods
in the solution of challenging problems in a wide variety of
scientific and engineering areas, as well as
the need for continuing research in this important field.Michele Benzi

abstract = {A major challenge in single particle reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy is to establish a reliable ab initio
three-dimensional model using two-dimensional projection images with unknown orientations. Common-lines--based methods
estimate the orientations without additional geometric information. However, such methods fail when the detection rate
of common-lines is too low due to the high level of noise in the images. An approximation to the least squares global
self-consistency error was obtained in [A. Singer and Y. Shkolnisky, SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 4 (2011), pp. 543--572]
using convex relaxation by semidefinite programming. In this
paper we introduce a more robust global self-consistency error and show that the corresponding optimization problem can
be solved via semidefinite relaxation. In order to prevent artificial clustering of the estimated viewing directions,
we further introduce a spectral norm term that is added as a constraint or as a regularization term to the relaxed
minimization problem. The resulting problems are solved using either the alternating direction method of multipliers
or an iteratively reweighted least squares procedure. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real images
demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce the orientation estimation error when the detection rate
of common-lines is low.},

the first attempt to account for all aspects of the

allows one to easily implement and simulate various
realistic scenarios giving rise to characteristic traffic phenomena of practical interest (e.g., queue formation due to roadwork or to a traffic light).
Moreover, it is analytically tractable under quite general assumptions, whereby fundamental properties of the solutions can be rigorously proved.},

scale than the characteristic length of the host crystal. In the
limit of very small mass, the macroscopic density of the polaron
converges to that of Pekar's nonlinear model, with a possibly
anisotropic dielectric matrix. The polaron also exhibits fast
microscopic oscillations which contribute to the energy at the
same order but whose characteristic length is small compared to
the scale of the polaron. These oscillations are described by a
simple periodic eigenvalue equation. Our approach also covers
multi-polarons composed of several particles, repelling each other

abstract = {At the microscopic scale, fresh cement paste is composed of random packing of irregular cement particles and their packing behavior plays an important role in microstructure evolution. The characterization of fresh cement paste microstructure is of particular interest in its physical properties, such as mechanical and transport properties. The preponderance of previous work has focused on the microstructure model by random packing of ellipsoidal particles, and little is known about three-dimensional (3D) non-ellipsoidal particles. In this paper, a modified cement particle size distribution function is used to facilitate particle size distribution of dodecahedral particles. Based on a random sequential algorithm, the microstructure model of fresh cement paste is simulated by the random sequential packing of dodecahedral particles with various sizes. Applying stereological tools and a serial sectioning analysis technique, the simulated microstructure composed of multi-sized dodecahedral cement particles is characterized and compared with that of ellipsoidal cement particles developed by the preliminary work to evaluate the influence of cement particle shape on the microstructure of fresh cement paste. Moreover, the random packings of multi-sized dodecahedral particles satisfied with three specified particle size distribution functions, respectively, are investigated to assess the effect of particle size distribution on the random packing of the dodecahedral particles. Finally, the reliability of the statistical results is verified by theoretical solutions.},

This work proposes a data-driven framework to address both the above components for two-phase materials (composites with two materials mixed together, each having distinct material properties) and presents the algorithmic backbone to such a framework. In line with the two components above, a set of numerical algorithms is presented for characterization and reconstruction of two-phase materials from microscopic images: these include grayscale image binarization, point-correlation and cluster-correlation characterization, and simulated annealing algorithm for microstructure reconstruction. Another set of algorithms is proposed to connect the material processing parameters with the resulting microstructure by mapping nonlinear, nonphysical regression parameters in microstructure correlation functions to a physically based, simple regression model of key material characteristic parameters. This methodology that relates material design variables to material structure is crucial for stochastic multiscale material design.},

abstract = {Motivation:  Owing to the size and complexity of large multi-component biological assemblies, the most tractable approach to determining their atomic structure is often to fit high-resolution radiographic or nuclear magnetic resonance structures of isolated components into lower resolution electron density maps of the larger assembly obtained using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This hybrid approach to structure determination requires that an atomic resolution structure of each component, or a suitable homolog, is available. If neither is available, then the amount of structural information regarding that component is limited by the resolution of the cryo-EM map. However, even if a suitable homolog cannot be identified using sequence analysis, a search for structural homologs should still be performed because structural homology often persists throughout evolution even when sequence homology is undetectable, As macromolecules can often be described as a collection of independently folded domains, one way of searching for structural homologs would be to systematically fit representative domain structures from a protein domain database into the medium/low resolution cryo-EM map and return the best fits. Taken together, the best fitting non-overlapping structures would constitute a ‘mosaic’ backbone model of the assembly that could aid map interpretation and illuminate biological function.  Result:  Using the computational principles of the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), we have developed FOLD-EM—a computational tool that can identify folded macromolecular domains in medium to low resolution (4–15 \r{A}) electron density maps and return a model of the constituent polypeptides in a fully automated fashion. As a by-product, FOLD-EM can also do flexible multi-domain fitting that may provide insight into conformational changes that occur in macromolecular assemblies.  Availability and implementation:  FOLD-EM is available at: http://cs.stanford.edu/~mitul/foldEM/, as a free open source software to the structural biology scientific community.

abstract = {There are many examples of problems in pattern analysis for which it is often possible to obtain systematic characterizations, if in addition a small number of useful features or parameters of the image are known a priori or can be estimated reasonably well. Often, the relevant features of a particular pattern analysis problem are easy to enumerate, as when statistical structures of the patterns are well understood from the knowledge of the domain. We study a problem from molecular image analysis, where such a domain-dependent understanding may be lacking to some degree and the features must be inferred via machine-learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a rigorous, fully automated technique for this problem. We are motivated by an application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) image processing needed to solve a central problem in molecular biology, aimed at obtaining the complete transcription profile of a single cell, a snapshot that shows which genes are being expressed and to what degree. Reed et&nbsp;al. (“Single molecule transcription profiling with AFM,” Nanotechnology, vol. 18, no. 4, 2007) showed that the transcription profiling problem reduces to making high-precision measurements of biomolecule backbone lengths, correct to within 20–25&nbsp;bp (6–7.5&nbsp;nm). Here, we present an image processing and length estimation pipeline using AFM that comes close to achieving these measurement tolerances. In particular, we develop a biased length estimator on trained coefficients of a simple linear regression model, biweighted by a Beaton–Tukey function, whose feature universe is constrained by James–Stein shrinkage to avoid overfitting. In terms of extensibility and addressing the model selection problem, this formulation subsumes the models we studied.},

abstract = {Thin film piezoelectric materials play an essential role in micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) energy harvesting due to its low power requirement and high available energy densities. Non-ferroelectric piezoelectric materials such as ZnO and AlN are highly silicon compatible making it suitable for MEMS energy harvesters in self-powered microsystems. This work primarily describe the design, simulation and fabrication of aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) cantilever beam deposited on &lt;100&gt; silicon substrate. AZO was chosen due its high piezoelectric coupling coefficient, ease of deposition and excellent bonding with silicon substrate. Doping of ZnO with Al has improved the electrical properties, conductivity and thermal stability. The proposed design operates in transversal mode (d31 mode) which was structured as a parallel plated capacitor using Si/Al/AZO/Al layers. The highlight of this work is the successful design and fabrication of Al/AZO/Al on &lt;100&gt; silicon as the substrate to make the device CMOS compatible for electronic functionality integration. Design and finite element modeling was conducted using COMSOL™ software to estimate the resonance frequency. RF Magnetron sputtering was chosen as the deposition method for aluminium and AZO. Material characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy to evaluate the piezoelectric qualities, surface morphology and the cross section. The fabricated energy harvester generated 1.61 V open circuit output voltage at 7.77 MHz resonance frequency. The experimental results agreed with the simulation results. The measured output voltage is sufficient for low power wireless sensor nodes as an alternative power sources to traditional chemical batteries.},

Raman technique is non-destructive and has high sensitivity for stress measurements. The compositional Raman mapping of crystal phases of microcapsule was done. The maximum stress at a level 1.74GPa was found on the sides of microcapsule. Silicon micromachined microcapsules have recently been used in biomedical applications as individual in sensing and drug delivery systems due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability properties. Microcapsules micromachining process is quite a complex procedure and to develop a high outcome the process has to be well controlled. One of the important physical characteristics influencing degradation of the microcapsules during the micromachining is a mechanical stresses in the microcapsules. In this work we investigated the stress in polysilicon microcapsules and their crystallinity before and after electrochemical etching process by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. It was shown that microcapsules fabrication process leads to the appearance of strong mechanical stress (up to 1.74GPa), at the edges of produced microcapsules which can damage the structures. The combined AFM and Raman investigations confirm the presence of silicon amorphous phase after technological process and allow the stress mapping. We demonstrate a great potential of Raman stress imaging to be used for the testing of silicon microstructures and an improvement of fabrication process.},

Demonstration of intense and precise nano-emitters. E-beam lithography was used to pattern a titanium mask on a GaN substrate with ordered arrays of nanoholes. This patterned mask served as a template for the subsequent ordered growth of GaN/InGaN nanorods by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The mask patterning process was optimized for several holes configurations. The smallest holes were 30nm in diameter with a pitch (center-to-center distance) of 100nm only. High quality masks of several geometries were obtained that could be used to grow ordered GaN/InGaN nanorods with full selectivity (growth localized inside the nanoholes only) over areas of hundreds of microns. Although some parasitic InGaN growth occurred between the nanorods during the In incorporation, transmission electron microscopy and photoluminescence measurements demonstrated that these ordered nanorods exhibit high crystal quality and reproducible optical properties.},

abstract = {Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted Highlights Developed a technique of size reduction to sub-ten nanometers by FIB milling. FIB milling is a top-down and site-specific approach with atomic resolution. No remarkable morphology and microstructure changes of W composite nanowires were observed after thinning. FIB thinning is an effective method towards size and quantum effects observation. Techniques for scalable fabrication of one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional nanowires are of great importance to observe quantum size effects and build quantum information devices. In this work, we developed a technique for size reduction of both lateral and freestanding tungsten composite nanostructures using focused-ion-beam (FIB) thinning. Different exposure times and ion-beam currents were used to control the final size and the thinning rate and accuracy of a group of nanowires, an individual nanowire and a portion of a nanowire by low-current site-specific milling. A transmission electron microscope image of a thinned superconducting tungsten composite nanowire with width reduced from 80nm to 50nm shows uniform shrinking along the length of the wire and high resolution image shows no obvious changes of the morphology after thinning. The variation of the superconducting critical current density upon thinning is insignificant; it is 1.7\'{\i} 105 and 1.4\'{\i} 105A/cm2 at 4.26K for the as-deposited and wire with width reduced to 50nm, respectively. These results suggest that FIB-milling is a potential approach for controllable size reduction enabling the observation of size- and quantum effects.},

This paper introduces a pneumatically-driven tensile stimulator for investigating the effect of mechanical strain on intracellular calcium expression in MG-63 cell (human osteoblast-like bone cell). An optically transparent micro-tensile stimulator array, consisting of deformable diaphragms and micro-fluidic channels, was fabricated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and a glass substrate. A strain gradient generated by a three-dimensional dome-shaped deformation of the circular diaphragm was applied to live cells seeded on the deformable diaphragm of the pneumatic stimulator. During the operation, intracellular calcium responses were measured using a laser-scanning microscope. Based on the temporal responses of the fluorescent intensities, we discovered that the periods of the measured calcium expressions of cells in different strain regions were well matched with the applied signal waveforms of the external compressed air. Moreover, the magnitude of the intensities in a cell was proportional to the magnitude of the mechanical strain. We were able to conclude that the release/uptake of intracellular calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum may be activated by, and sensitive to the applied strain.},

The method may be used in automated microscopy for tuberculosis detection. We address the location of regions-of-interest in previously scanned sputum smear slides requiring re-examination in automated microscopy for tuberculosis (TB) detection. We focus on the core component of microscope auto-positioning, which is to find a point of reference, position and orientation, on the slide so that it can be used to automatically bring desired fields to the field-of-view of the microscope. We use virtual slide maps together with geometric hashing to localise a query image, which then acts as the point of reference. The true positive rate achieved by the algorithm was above 88% even for noisy query images captured at slide orientations up to 26 . The image registration error, computed as the average mean square error, was less than 14pixel2 (corresponding to 1.02µm2). The algorithm is inherently robust to changes in slide orientation and placement and showed high tolerance to illumination changes and robustness to noise.},

abstract = {The connected vehicle research program is a multimodal research initiative in the U.S. that envisions a fully connected transportation system with wireless communications linking vehicles, the infrastructure, and handheld smart devices. This paper designs and evaluates a reservation-based approach to intersection control that is designed to take full advantage of the unprecedented connectivity that the connected vehicle initiative promises to provide. The control approach, which is referred to herein as the “intelligent intersection” approach, builds on the previous work by Dresner and Stone by introducing new features to better account for several aspects of the real-world driving environment. To design and evaluate the “intelligent intersection,” a novel simulation test bed for connected vehicle applications is developed. The test bed integrates a microscopic traffic simulator with a network simulator and an emission analyzer. Using the integrated simulator, the mobility and environmental benefits of the intelligent intersection approach, compared with those of traditional control methods, are evaluated on two case studies: 1) an isolated intersection and 2) a real-world transportation network with multiple intersections. Results show that the proposed control approach offers significant mobility and environmental benefits. For example, for the second test case and using observed traffic volumes, the intelligent intersection reduced the average vehicle delay by 85%, fuel consumption by 50%, and emissions by 39%–50%. The study also demonstrates the utility of using the simulator test bed in the design and evaluation of connected vehicle applications.},

Si tips with metal (e.g. PtIr) and doped-diamond coatings are most commonly used. Metal coatings are however prone to rapid wear and diamond coatings are limited in conductivity and spatial resolution. Therefore, we have developed solid TiN tips with a pyramidal shape made by molding using anisotropic Si etching for defining an inverted pyramid and TiN sputtering for mold filling. The TiN tips are attached to Ni electroplated cantilevers. The probes are removed from the substrate using a dedicated peel-off step. The fabrication process is based on state-of-the-art 200-mm Si wafer technology. Probe evaluation in AFM shows a typical spatial resolution of about 8-15nm for these TiN tips. Using the hard TiN tips in scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) we demonstrate two-dimensional measurements of Ge doping staircase structures which could so far only be measured by doped diamond tips. Further measurements of carbon nanotube (CNT) interconnects and high-k metal gate stacks by conductive AFM (c-AFM) illustrate the potential of the TiN tips.

The transmittance and reflectance spectra of the nanoantennas, were acquired by means of an Infrared microscope coupled to a Michelson Interferometer. In all the nanoantenna devices, the plasmonic resonance follows a linear scaling relation: a lattice parameter change of a +/-(5-10)%, indeed, results in a shift of the Si (1,0) plasmonic resonance frequency which is proportional to 1/a. This scaling behavior offers a useful tool for device frequency tuning, which can be used to obtain a fine spectral overlap with the protein amide-I and amide-II bands. A Lorentzian analysis of the resonance peaks reveals that our nanostructures have an high Q factor (Q=@n"0/@D@n), demonstrating the effectiveness of our fabrication procedures.},

In particular, it is deemed important whenever one needs to mine high-content images or large scale image databases in a more expressive way than a purely statistically one. Continuing previous efforts to incorporate structural analysis by developing specific efficient morphological tools performing on mesh representations like Delaunay triangulations, we propose to formalize spatial relation modeling techniques dedicated to unorganized point sets. We provide an original mesh lattice framework which is more convenient for structural representations of large image data by means of interest point sets and their morphological analysis. The set of designed numerical operators is based on a specific dilation operator that makes it possible to handle concepts like ''between'' or ''left of'' over sparse representations of image data such as graphs. Based on this new theoretical framework for reasoning about images, we are able to process high-level queries over large histopathological images, knowing that digitized histopathology is a new challenge in the field of bio-imaging due to the high-content nature and large size of these images.},

Improvements in computer performance and in image combination software make the technique simple and efficient. Its latest developments allow three-dimensional reconstructions of inclusions and other features of petrographic interest to be visualized. The difficulties of imaging under the optical microscope at high magnification are reviewed and demonstrations of the advantages of the multifocus technique are provided.

abstract = {Principle of atomic force microscope (AFM) is on the basis of cantilever's deflection. However, up to now, there are still no effective methods to model the cantilever's deflection with high precision, which will usually result in a poor measurement accuracy of AFM and has greatly limited further applications of AFM in more different fields. Thus, a global shape from defocus method, which is only based on a single vision sensor, is introduced in this paper to reconstruct the bended shape of AFM cantilever. First, the model of the defocus imaging is given using the concepts of relative blurring and diffusion equation. Second, the relationship between the relative blurring and the interested depth information is built with basic imaging formulas. Subsequently, the depth measurement problem is transformed into an optimization issue and an algorithm is designed to compute the deflection of cantilever. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted and results are analyzed to show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {A new method to maximize the output power of a piezoelectric energy harvesting system has been previously proposed by the authors. This can be achieved by reducing the mechanical damping through folding a given piezoelectric material equally and splitting it into smaller width. Experimental results have shown that the power harvested increases when the number of fold increases but with the trade off the optimal operating frequency range, which is referred as the bandwidth. This paper aims to improve the bandwidth by modifying the natural frequency of each split piezoelectric material and connecting them in parallel. Experimental results show that the bandwidth increases as the difference between the natural frequency of the reduced-width piezoelectric materials increases. Although these results are with trade off in reducing output power gain, the gain in the bandwidth per unit output power reduction is still increasing. This shows that the maximum output power of the harvesting system can be ensured with the width-splitting method and the bandwidth of the output can be widened by increasing the difference between the natural frequencies of the participating piezoelectric elements. This maximization method with wideband feature can be implemented at microscopic stage to be incorporated in the microelectronics devices such as MEMS.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a public decision support system (DSS) distinguished from various DSSs in the private business sector in terms of its ownership, data scarcity, and beneficiaries. In particular, our system is intended to play a vital role in assessing and optimizing emergency response plans for rare but catastrophic events such as the September 11th attacks. While taking an agent-based microscopic simulation approach in a hierarchical framework, we used our model to estimate the effectiveness of alternative evacuation strategies to support emergency response planning as a part of business continuity planning for all private business organizations. The presented model is unique because it considers individuals with disabilities explicitly in terms of speed, ability to negotiate the environment, and normalcy bias depending on type of disability. It is also capable of classifying the environment in terms of accessibility characteristics encompassing various conditions which have been shown to have a disproportionate effect upon the behavior of individuals with disabilities during an emergency. Through a series of simulation experiments, our system identified specific locations (e.g., the NW landing) on the 3rd floor of the test bed building as possible bottleneck spots under certain conditions (e.g., the sharp increase in individuals with disabilities among residents). This way, our system provides the architect with tools to test the structure's design to determine how well it meets the identified requirements for emergency evacuation to accommodate this shifting demographic. In particular, our system strongly demonstrated the effectiveness of new emergency evacuation strategies for individuals with disabilities such as assisted evacuations which allows other healthy people to play more active roles compared to traditional strategies in which individuals with disabilities are helplessly waiting for assistants such as fire fighters at the designated area. Our system also revealed that people using wheelchairs and those with lower stamina were at the greatest risk. People with lower stamina such as the elderly, people with chronic health conditions, or those with temporary injuries are at a greater risk mainly because they are not easily identifiable. Ultimately, the proposed DSS system can be used to inform public policy professionals of more effective, evidence-based evacuation planning and environmental design methods based on a better understanding of the behavior of individuals with disabilities.},

Here, we propose one method for automatic segmentation and analysis of corneal nerves from images obtained in vivo through corneal confocal microscopy. The method is capable of segmenting corneal nerves, with sensitivity near 90% and a percentage of false recognitions with an average of 5.3%.

abstract = {Computational methods used in microscopy cell image analysis have largely augmented the impact of imaging techniques, becoming fundamental for biological research. The understanding of cell regulation processes is very important in biology, and in particular confocal fluorescence imaging plays a relevant role for the in vivo observation of cells. However, most biology researchers still analyze cells by visual inspection alone, which is time consuming and prone to induce subjective bias. This makes automatic cell image analysis essential for large scale, objective studies of cells. While the classic approach for automatic cell analysis is to use image segmentation, for in vivo confocal fluorescence microscopy images of plants, such approach is neither trivial nor is it robust to image quality variations. To analyze plant cells in in vivo confocal fluorescence microscopy images with robustness and increased performance, we propose the use of local convergence filters (LCF). These filters are based in gradient convergence and as such can handle illumination variations, noise and low contrast. We apply a range of existing convergence filters for cell nuclei analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana plant root tip. To further increase contrast invariance, we present an augmentation to local convergence approaches based on image phase information. Through the use of convergence index filters we improved the results for cell nuclei detection and shape estimation when compared with baseline approaches. Using phase congruency information we were able to further increase performance by 11% for nuclei detection accuracy and 4% for shape adaptation. Shape regularization was also applied, but with no significant gain, which indicates shape estimation was good for the applied filters.},

abstract = {Motivation: Knowledge of the subcellular location of a protein is crucial for understanding its functions. The subcellular pattern of a protein is typically represented as the set of cellular components in which it is located, and an important task is to determine this set from microscope images. In this article, we address this classification problem using confocal immunofluorescence images from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project. The HPA contains images of cells stained for many proteins; each is also stained for three reference components, but there are many other components that are invisible. Given one such cell, the task is to classify the pattern type of the stained protein. We first randomly select local image regions within the cells, and then extract various carefully designed features from these regions. This region-based approach enables us to explicitly study the relationship between proteins and different cell components, as well as the interactions between these components. To achieve these two goals, we propose two discriminative models that extend logistic regression with structured latent variables. The first model allows the same protein pattern class to be expressed differently according to the underlying components in different regions. The second model further captures the spatial dependencies between the components within the same cell so that we can better infer these components. To learn these models, we propose a fast approximate algorithm for inference, and then use gradient-based methods to maximize the data likelihood.Results: In the experiments, we show that the proposed models help improve the classification accuracies on synthetic data and real cellular images. The best overall accuracy we report in this article for classifying 942 proteins into 13 classes of patterns is about 84.6%, which to our knowledge is the best so far. In addition, the dependencies learned are consistent with prior knowledge of cell organization.Availability: http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software/.Contact:Jeff.Schneider@cs.cmu.edu, murphy@cmu.edu},

To characterize the locations and distribution of synapses in complex neuronal networks visualized by mGRASP, it is essential to detect mGRASP fluorescence signals with high accuracy.Results: We developed a fully automatic method for detecting mGRASP-labeled synapse puncta. By modeling each punctum as a Gaussian distribution, our method enables accurate detection even when puncta of varying size and shape partially overlap. The method consists of three stages: blob detection by global thresholding; blob separation by watershed; and punctum modeling by a variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture models. Extensive testing shows that the three-stage method improved detection accuracy markedly, and especially reduces under-segmentation. The method provides a goodness-of-fit score for each detected punctum, allowing efficient error detection. We applied this advantage to also develop an efficient interactive method for correcting errors.Availability: The software is available on http://jinny.kist.re.krContact:tingzhao@gmail.com; kimj@kist.re.kr},

The homogenized macroscopic model is featured by the fading memory effects arising from the microflow in the dual porosity. We derive the steady state formulations and discuss several topics related to the numerical implementation of the model, namely the solution procedure of the discretized microscopic problems, evaluation of the homogenized coefficients and an approximation of the convolution integrals of the macroscopic model, so that the fading memory effects are computationally tractable. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approximation schemes discussed in the paper. All computations were performed using the in-house developed finite element code SfePy allowing the multiscale simulations. Besides various potential engineering applications, the present model is intended for simulations of compact bone poroelasticity.},

However, it is a challenging to segment entire leukocyte populations due to the changing features extracted in the leukocyte image, and this task remains an unsolved issue in blood cell image segmentation. This paper presents an efficient strategy to construct a segmentation model for any leukocyte image using simulated visual attention via learning by on-line sampling. In the sampling stage, two types of visual attention, ''bottom-up'' and ''top-down'' together with the movement of the human eye are simulated. We focus on a few regions of interesting and sample high gradient pixels to group training sets. While in the learning stage, the SVM (support vector machine) model is trained in real-time to simulate the visual neuronal system and then classifies pixels and extracts leukocytes from the image. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance compared to the marker controlled watershed algorithms with manual intervention and thresholding-based methods.},

The Monogenic Signal is a powerful method of computing the phase of discrete signals in image data, however it is typically used with band-pass filters in the capacity of a feature detector. Substituting low-pass filters allows the Monogenic Signal to produce approximate solutions to the inverse Laplacian, with the added benefit of tunability and the generation of three equivariant properties (namely local energy, local phase and local orientation), which allow the development of powerful numerical solutions for a new set of problems. These principles are applied here in the context of biological cell segmentation from brightfield microscopy image data. The Monogenic Signal approach is used to generate reduced noise solutions to the Transport of Intensity Equation for optical phase recovery, and the resulting local phase and local orientation terms are combined in an iterative level set approach to accurately segment cell boundaries. Potential applications of this approach are discussed with respect to other fields.},

Using this method, a significantly larger number of tracks are obtained than was previously possible. This permits calculation of reliable distributions for parameters of bacterial motion. The PHD filter output was tested by checking agreement with a careful manual analysis.

abstract = {The spatial variation of the extracellular action potentials (EAP) of a single neuron contains information about the size and location of the dominant current source of its action potential generator, which is typically in the vicinity of the soma. Using this dependence in reverse in a three-component realistic probe + brain + source model, we solved the inverse problem of characterizing the equivalent current source of an isolated neuron from the EAP data sampled by an extracellular probe at multiple independent recording locations. We used a dipole for the model source because there is extensive evidence it accurately captures the spatial roll-off of the EAP amplitude, and because, as we show, dipole localization, beyond a minimum cell-probe distance, is a more accurate alternative to approaches based on monopole source models. Dipole characterization is separable into a linear dipole moment optimization where the dipole location is fixed, and a second, nonlinear, global optimization of the source location. We solved the linear optimization on a discrete grid via the lead fields of the probe, which can be calculated for any realistic probe + brain model by the finite element method. The global source location was optimized by means of Tikhonov regularization that jointly minimizes model error and dipole size. The particular strategy chosen reflects the fact that the dipole model is used in the near field, in contrast to the typical prior applications of dipole models to EKG and EEG source analysis. We applied dipole localization to data collected with stepped tetrodes whose detailed geometry was measured via scanning electron microscopy. The optimal dipole could account for 96% of the power in the spatial variation of the EAP amplitude. Among various model error contributions to the residual, we address especially the error in probe geometry, and the extent to which it biases estimates of dipole parameters. This dipole characterization method can be applied to any recording technique that has the capabilities of taking multiple independent measurements of the same single units.},

abstract = {A new multiscale computational method is developed for the elasto-plastic analysis of heterogeneous continuum materials with both periodic and random microstructures. In the method, the multiscale base functions which can efficiently capture the small-scale features of elements are constructed numerically and employed to establish the relationship between the macroscopic and microscopic variables. Thus, the detailed microscopic stress fields within the elements can be obtained easily. For the construction of the numerical base functions, several different kinds of boundary conditions are introduced and their influences are investigated. In this context, a two-scale computational modeling with successive iteration scheme is proposed. The new method could be implemented conveniently and adopted to the general problems without scale separation and periodicity assumptions. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out and the results are compared with the direct FEM. It is shown that the method developed provides excellent precision of the nonlinear response for the heterogeneous materials. Moreover, the computational cost is reduced dramatically.},

The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristic curves of the assembled QDSSCs were measured. Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) substrates were coated with 20 nm-diameter TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). Presynthesized colloidal CdS quantum dots of different particles size were deposited on the TiO2- coated substrates using direct adsorption (DA) method. The FTO counter electrodes were coated with platinum, while the electroelectrolyte containing I-/I3- redox species was sandwiched between the two electrodes. The short current density (Jsc) and efficiency (η) increases as the particle size increases. The values of Jsc increases linearly with increasing the intensities of the sun light which indicates the greater sensitivity of the assembled cells.},

The appropriate choice of the titanium precursor allowed the control of morphological and photoluminescence (PL) properties of SrTiO3 compound.

abstract = {In recent years, polymer clay nanocomposites have been attracting considerable interests in polymers science because of their advantages. There are many scientists who researched about this kind of material and demonstrated that when polymer matrix was added to little weight of clay, properties were enhanced considerably. Because clay is a hydrophilic substance so it is difficult to use as filler in polymer matrix having hydrophobic nature, so clay needs to be modified to become compatible with polymer. In this study, poly(ethylene oxide) was used as a new modifier for clay to replace some traditional ionic surfactants such as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary alkyl ammonium or alkylphosphonium cations having the following disadvantages: disintegrate at high temperature, catalyze polymer degradation, andmake nanoproducts colorific, and so forth. In order to evaluate modifying effect of poly(ethylene oxide),modified clay products were characterize d by X-ray spectrum. Then organoclay was used to prepare nanocomposite based on unsaturated polyester. Morphology and properties of nanocomposites were measure d by Xray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, tensile strength, and thermal stability. The results showed that clay galleries changed to intercalated state in the nanocomposites. Properties of nanocomposites were improved a lot when the loading of the organoclay was used at 1 phr.},

abstract = {A mesoporous material sphere based on silica, SBA-16, was chemically modified with alkoxysilane using two different solvents: methanol and toluene. The influence of the chemical modification of the matrix on the release rate of a model drug was also studied. The structural characteristics of the materials were evaluated by small-angle X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, and transmission electron microscopy. The functionalization of the matrix was evaluated using thermal analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, 13C and 29Si solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and elemental analysis, CHN. The results show that alkoxysilane groups have been chemically bonded to silicon atoms on the surface of cubic Im3m mesoporous silica. The influence of the release rate of atenolol molecules from chemically modified mesoporous SBA-16 could be identified, since significant differences could be observed among the release patterns of the different materials.},

Optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis were used. The following four materials were prepared at room temperature: cured unmodified epoxy, cured toughened epoxy, cured unmodified epoxy/Cloisite 30B nanocomposites, and cured toughened epoxy/Cloisite 30B nanocomposites. Mixing process was performed by mechanical stirring. Poly (etheramine) was used as the curing agent. The detailed TEM images revealed co-continuous and dispersed spherical rubber in the epoxy-rubber blend, suggesting a new proposed mechanism of phase separation. Highmagnification TEM analysis showed good interactions between rubber and Cloisite 30B in the ternary system. Also, it was found that rubber particles could enhance the separation of silicates layers. Both XRD and TEM analyses confirmed that the intercalation of Cloisite 30B was achieved. No distinct exfoliated silicates were observed by TEM. Aggregates of layered silicates (tactoids) were observed by SEM and EDX, in addition to TEM at low magnification. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of organic and inorganic elements in the binary and ternary epoxy systems containing Cloisite 30B.},

Scanning electron microscopy showed that the neutralized PCL-chitin nanofibrous mats were morphologically stable, with a mean diameter of 340.5 ± 2.6 nm, compared with a diameter of 524.2 ± 12.1 nm for PCL mats. The nanofibrous mats showed decreased water contact angles as the proportion of chitin increased. However, the tensile properties of nanofibrous mats containing 30 ~ 50% (wt/wt) chitin were enhanced compared with PCL-only mats. In vitro studies showed that the viability of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) for up to 7 days in culture was higher on composite (OD value: 1.42 ± 0.09) than on PCL-only (0.51 ± 0.14) nanofibrous mats, with viability correlated with chitin concentration. Together, our results suggest that PCL-chitin nanofibrous mats can be used as an implantable substrate to modulate HDF viability in tissue engineering.},

The negatively charged methoxy polyethylene glycol-coated magnetite nanoparticles in water exhibited longer-time dispersion with small hydrodynamic size than the magnetite nanoparticles synthesized by the thermal decomposition of iron(III) acetylacetonate in polyethylene glycol. The less conjunction between methoxy polyethylene glycol-coated magnetite nanoparticles due to the inert -CH3 terminal group may cause their higher stability in water dispersion.},

For this purpose, two different sets of PS films with thicknesses of 5 and 20 µmwere prepared frompyrene-(P-) labeled PS particles and covered with various layers of TiO2 using dip-coating method. These films were then annealed at elevated temperatures above glass transition temperature (Tg) of PS in the range of 100-280°C. Fluorescence emission intensity, Ip from P and transmitted light intensity, Itr were measured after each annealing step to monitor the stages of film formation. The results showed that film formation from PS latexes occurs on the top surface of PS/TiO2 composites and thus developed independent of TiO2 content for both film sets. But the surface morphology of the films was found to vary with both TiO2 content and film thickness. After removal of PS, thin films provide a quite ordered porous structure while thick films showed nonporous structure.},

It was also found that mesoporous silica nanoflakes can be prepared by adding tetrahydrofuran to the reaction mixtures.},

abstract = {Novel chelating ligands are very significant for preparing nanocrystals with different morphologies and applications. In this paper, we directly introduced amine groups onto UCNPs by choosing a new chelating ligand tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) to synthesis NaYF4:Yb, Er through hydrothermal method. The influences of rare earth concentration, the ratio of RE/TEPA, solvent composition, and reaction time on the morphology and fluorescence intensity of the as-prepared NaYF4:Yb, Er samples were systematically investigated and discussed. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and upconversion luminescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the product. It was found that rare earth concentration, ratio of RE/TEPA, solvent composition, and reaction time were all responsible for the luminescent intensity and morphology.},

abstract = {SiO2 nanoparticles have been dispersed selectively in the polystyrene (PS) microdomain of polystyrene-block-polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) block copolymer via the blending of PS-b-PMMA with PS-tethered SiO2. As observed by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, the incorporation of SiO2 particles not only enlarges the PS microdomain but also reduces the surface energy of the PS microdomain and transforms the morphology from either lamellar layers or cylinders to islanded bicontinuous microstructures. Blending SiO2 particles with an excessive amount or with a particle size larger than that of the PS microdomain would pose an extreme constraint on the molecular rearrangement, unstabliize the microdomain separation, and even make the microdomain separation unobservable. The nanosize and the uniform distribution of the PS microdomain in the PS-b-PMMA polymer have thus enabled us to achieve a uniform distribution of the inorganic SiO2 particles in the organic polymeric matrix.},

abstract = {Biomedical applications such as wound dressing for skin regeneration, stem cell transplantation, or drug delivery require special demands on the three-dimensional porous scaffolds. Besides the biocompatibility and mechanical properties, the morphology is the most important attribute of the scaffold. Specific surface area, volume, and size of the pores have considerable effect on cell adhesion, growth, and proliferation. In the case of incorporated biologically active substances, their release is also influenced by the internal structure of nanofibers. Although many scientific papers are focused on the preparation of nanofibers and evaluation of biological tests, the morphological characterization was described just briefly as service methods. The aim of this paper is to summarize the methods applicable for morphological characterization of nanofibers and supplement it by the results of our research. Needleless electrospinning technique was used to prepare nanofibers from polylactide, poly(ε-caprolactone), gelatin, and polyamide. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the fiber diameters and to reveal eventual artifacts in the nanofibrous structure. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements were employed to measure the specific surface areas. Mercury porosimetry was used to determine total porosities and compare pore size distributions of the prepared samples.},

Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) phase formed on the sintered pellets immersed in a normal saline solution for 14 d at 37°C. The intensities of hydroxyapatite (HA) reflections in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pellets were retrieved to as-sintered state. The pellet surface morphology shows that CPP crystallites were clearly present and make an amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) to discriminate against become to the area of slice join together. In addition, the intensities of the CPP reflections in the XRD patterns were the highest when the pellets were immersed for 28 d. When the CPP powders were extracted from the pellets after immersion in the solution for 14 d, the viability of 3T3 cells remained above 90% for culture times from 1 to 4 d. The pellet surface morphology observed using optical microscopy showed that the cells did not adhere to the bottom of the sintered pellets when cultured for 4 d; however, some CPP phase precipitates were formed, as confirmed by XRD. In consequence, the results suggest that the sintered HA powders are good materials for use in biomedical applications because of their good biocompatibility.},

Their crystal structure, surface morphology, and hydrophilicity have been characterized by X-ray diffractometer, atomic force microscope, and water contact angle apparatus, respectively. The influence of annealing time and UV irradiation time on hydrophilic property of Ag-TiO2 thin films have been studied in detail. It is shown that annealing time influences crystal structure of Ag-TiO2 thin films. The unannealed film is amorphous and shows poor hydrophilicity. With the increase of annealing time from 15 to 120 min, the grain-size slowly increases and tends to uniformity. A suitable annealing time can significantly enhance the hydrophilic behavior of Ag-TiO2 films. Water contact angle decreases with the increase of irradiation time. The mechanism of hydrophilicity has been proposed and can be attributed to the increase of oxygen anion radicals O2- and reactive center of surface Ti3+.},

Solid diffuse reflectance (SDR) studies showed a linear increase in absorbance at 416 nm with increase in the number of m-TiO 2 thin films. The LbL assembled thin films were tested for their photocatalytic activity through the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible-light illumination. From the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the thin films had a porous morphology and the atomic force microscope (AFM) studies showed "rough" surfaces. The porous and rough surface morphology resulted in high surface areas hence the high photocatalytic degradation (up to 97% over a 6.5 h irradiation period) using visible-light observed. Increasing the number of multilayers deposited on the glass slides resulted in increased film thickness and an increased rate of photodegradation due to increase in the availability of more nanocatalysts (more sites for photodegradation). The LbL assembled thin films had strong adhesion properties which made them highly stable thus displaying the same efficiencies after five (5) reusability cycles.},

abstract = {Surface modification is a good way to improve the surface activity and interfacial strength of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) when used as fillers in the polymer composites. Among the reported methods for nanotube modification, mixed acid oxidation and plasma treatment is often used by introducing polar groups to the sidewall of MWCNT successfully. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of different surface modification of MWCNT on the mechanical property and electrical conductivity of Fluoro-elastomer (FE)/MWCNT nanocomposites. MWCNTs were surface modified by mixed oxidation and CF4 plasma treatment and then used to reinforce the fluoro elastomer (FE, a copolymer of trifluorochloroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride). FE/MWCNT composite films were prepared from mixture solutions of ethylacetate and butylacetate, using untreated CNTs (UCNTs), acid-modified CNTs (ACNTs), and CF4 plasma-modified CNT (FCNTs). In each case, MWCNT content was 0.01wt%, 0.05wt%, 0.1wt%, and 0.2wt% with respect to the polymer. Morphology and mechanical properties were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, as well as dynamicmechanical tests. The SEMresults indicated that dispersion of ACNTs and especially FCNTs in FE was better than that of UCNTs. DMA indicated mechanical properties of FCNT composites were improved over ACNT and UCNT filled FE. The resulting electrical properties of the composites ranged fromdielectric behavior to bulk conductivities of 10-2 Sm-1 and were found to depend strongly on the surface modification methods of MWCNTs.},

Comparison of the FESEM results after oxidization shows that the PsNiO on the nickel thin film was more regular and controllable than the NiO layer on the nickel foil. The FESEM images also show that the thickness of the nickel thin film affected the PsNiO size obtained after oxidization. This resulted from the growth of the porous structure at grain boundaries and from the grain sizes.

abstract = {The porous composite scaffolds (PHBV/HA) consisting of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and hydroxyapatite (HA) were fabricated using a hot-press machine and salt-leaching. Collagen (type I) was then immobilized on the surface of the porous PHBV/HA composite scaffolds to improve tissue compatibility. The structure and morphology of the collagen-immobilized composite scaffolds (PHBV/HA/Col) were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The potential of the porous PHBV/HA/Col composite scaffolds for use as a bone scaffold was assessed by an experiment with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) in terms of cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. The results showed that the PHBV/HA/Col composite scaffolds possess better cell adhesion and significantly higher proliferation and differentiation than the PHBV/HA composite scaffolds and the PHBV scaffolds. These results suggest that the PHBV/HA/Col composite scaffolds have a high potential for use in the field of bone regeneration and tissue engineering.},

The method is inexpensive and efficient for synthesis of oxide nanoparticles. The average crystallite size of Mg(x)Fe(1-x)O nanoparticles was estimated from the full-width-half maximum of the X-ray diffraction peaks of powders using Debye-Scherrer's formula; the average crystallite size varies from 16 nm to 51 nm. From X-ray diffraction analysis, it was observed that Mg(x)Fe(1-x)O nanoparticles have cubic structure. The particle size measured by particle size analyzer ranges from 37.7 nm to 73 nm which is in the order of XRD results. Thermal analysis was done by thermal gravimetric-differential thermal analyzer. The particle size and morphology of the synthesized powder were examined by transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope. The crystal size and particle size were compared with some of the most recently published research works by XRD and TEM. FTIR conforms formation of the Mg(x)Fe(1-x)O.},

abstract = {This work presents a few variational multiscale models for charge transport in complex physical,
chemical, and biological systems and engineering devices, such as fuel cells, solar cells, battery
cells, nanofluidics, transistors, and ion channels. An essential ingredient of the present models,
introduced in an earlier paper [Bull. Math. Biol.,  72 (2010), pp. 1562--1622], is
the use of the differential geometry theory of surfaces as a natural means to geometrically separate the
macroscopic domain from the microscopic domain, while dynamically coupling  discrete  and
continuum  descriptions. Our main strategy is to construct the total energy functional of a charge
transport system to encompass the polar and nonpolar free energies of solvation and chemical
potential related energy. By using the Euler--Lagrange variation, coupled Laplace--Beltrami and
Poisson--Nernst--Planck (LB-PNP) equations are derived.  The solution of the LB-PNP equations leads to
the minimization of the total free energy and explicit profiles of electrostatic potential and
densities of charge species. To further reduce the computational complexity, the Boltzmann
distribution obtained from the Poisson--Boltzmann (PB) equation  is utilized to represent the
densities of certain charge species so as to avoid the computationally expensive solution of some
Nernst--Planck (NP) equations. Consequently, the coupled
Laplace--Beltrami and  Poisson--Boltzmann--Nernst--Planck (LB-PBNP) equations are proposed for charge transport in
heterogeneous systems. A major emphasis of the present formulation is the consistency between
equilibrium Laplace--Beltrami and PB (LB-PB) theory and nonequilibrium LB-PNP theory at equilibrium. Another major emphasis is
the capability of the reduced LB-PBNP model to fully recover the prediction of the LB-PNP model at
nonequilibrium settings. To account for the fluid impact on the charge transport, we derive coupled
Laplace--Beltrami, Poisson--Nernst--Planck, and
Navier--Stokes equations from the variational principle
for  chemo-electro-fluid systems. A number of computational algorithms are developed to  implement
the proposed new variational multiscale models in an efficient manner. A set of ten protein
molecules and a realistic ion channel, Gramicidin A,  are employed to confirm the consistency and
verify the capability of the algorithms.  Extensive  numerical experiments are designed to validate the proposed
variational multiscale models.  A good quantitative agreement between our model prediction and the
experimental measurement of current-voltage curves is observed for the  Gramicidin A channel
transport. This paper also provides a brief review of the field.},

Stokes flow whose thickness is of order $varepsilon ll 1$, but we also take into account the roughness patterns of the boundary
that are described at order $varepsilon^2$, leading to a perturbation of the classical Reynolds approximation. The asymptotic
expansion leading to the description of the scale effects is
rigorously derived through a sequence of Reynolds-type problems and Stokes-type boundary layer problems.
The well-posedness of the related problems and estimates in suitable functional spaces are proven at any order of
the expansion. In particular, we show that the micro- and macro-scale coupling effects may be analyzed as the
consequence of two features: the interaction between the macroscopic scale (order 1) of the flow and the
perturbation of the microscopic scale (order $varepsilon$)  by the interaction with a microscopic scale of order $varepsilon^2$
related to the roughness patterns. Moreover, the converging-diverging profile of the confined flow, which is
typical in lubrication theory, provides additional micro- and macro-scale coupling effects.},

abstract = {A hybrid support material for catalyst is proposed and studied in the paper. A small fraction of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were added into commercial carbon black (CB)-supported PtRu electrocatalyst. Catalyst inks with different SWCNTs’ doping concentrations were prepared, characterized, and investigated for methanol electrooxidation using cyclic voltammetry. Compared with the control group (no SWCNTs’ doping), catalyst with a proper amount of SWCNTs’ doping has five times catalytic activity enhancement for methanol oxidation for the same amount of PtRu loading. Catalyst films with different SWCNTs’ doping concentrations were inspected with scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Results suggested that addition of a SWCNT into PtRu/CB altered the catalyst-supporting material from pure CB spheres to hybrid SWCNT-CB matrix and, therefore, significantly changed PtRu nanoparticles distribution, catalyst film morphology, and, consequently, the catalyst activity toward methanol oxidation. A proper fraction of SWCNTs will attract PtRu onto surrounding SWCNTs without causing aggregation, which improves the effective surface reaction area and catalyst activity for methanol oxidation. This hybrid catalyst-support matrix provides a solution to the challenging issue of catalyst dispersion and accessibility dilemma and is very promising as a highly efficient and cost-effective catalyst system.},

User studies confirm that the approach is effective, and can complement more traditional techniques such as color-based cues. We provide two implementations, one of which computes defocus in real time on the GPU, and examples of their application.},

abstract = {In Toponomics, the function protein pattern in cells or tissue (the toponome) is imaged and analyzed for applications in toxicology, new drug development and patient-drug-interaction. The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns. We discuss our approach with respect to a cell probe containing lymphocytes and a prostate tissue section.},

However, assessing the differences responsible for the variation of rheological properties requires taking measurements of microscopic features. A statistically-founded algorithm is proposed for automatic identification of cheese micro-features in Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imagery for quantitative analysis. Twenty SEM images of Ragusano cheese were recorded and manually labelled using a different colour coding for each of three features: whey pockets, fat globules, and protein matrix. The marked micrographs were used to train a statistical model. In turn, that model was used to mark the looked-for features on new images of the same type. Namely, pixel probabilities of belonging to the three classes above mentioned were computed, using pixel neighbourhoods at different scales. Each pixel was set within the most probable class. The proposed method could recognize the microstructure of Ragusano cheese in SEM images with higher accuracy (on average, 78.0% correct pixels) than other popular algorithms in the literature (e.g., Maximum Response 8 73.7% correct pixels). Being completely automatic in the operative phase, this algorithm allows to batch-process lots of images with no human intervention. It can also be used for any other application, since it can handle any number of phases.},

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies were showed that the film is covered well on n-type Si substrate and have polycrystalline structure. An Au-Sb electrode was used as an ohmic contact. The Zn/ZnO/n-Si/Au-Sb sandwich structure demonstrated clearly rectifying behavior by the current-voltage (I-V) curves studied at room temperature. The sample temperature effect on the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of Zn/ZnO/n-Si/Au-Sb structure was investigated in temperature range 80-320K by steps of 20K. The parameters such as barrier height, ideality factor and series resistance of this structure were calculated from the forward bias I-V characteristics as a function of sample temperature. It was seen that the ideality factor and series resistance were decreased; the barrier height were increased with increasing temperature. The experimental values of barrier height and ideality factor for this device were calculated as 0.808eV and 1.519 at 320K; 0.220eV and 4.961 at 80K, respectively. These abnormal behaviors can be explained by the barrier inhomogeneities at the metal-semiconductor (M-S) interface.},

abstract = {The problem of segmentation of mouse brain images into anatomical structures is an important stage of practically every analytical procedure for these images. The present study suggests a new approach to automated segmentation of anatomical structures in the images of NISSL-stained histological sections of mouse brain. The segmentation algorithm is based on the method of supervised learning using the existing anatomical labeling of the corresponding sections from a specialized mouse brain atlas. A mouse brain section to be segmented into anatomical structures is preliminarily associated with a section from the mouse brain atlas displaying the maximum similarity. The image of this section is then preprocessed in order to enhance its quality and to make it as close to the corresponding atlas image as possible. An efficient algorithm of luminance equalization, an extension of the well-known Retinex algorithm is proposed. A random forest is trained on pixel feature vectors constructed based on the atlas section images and the corresponding class labels associated with anatomical structures extracted from the atlas anatomical labeling. The trained classifier is then applied to classify pixels of an experimental section into anatomical structures. A new combination of features based on superpixels and location priors is suggested. Accuracy of the obtained result is increased by using Markov random field. Procedures of luminance equalization and subsequent segmentation into anatomical structures have been tested on real experimental sections.},

abstract = {Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy excites a thin evanescent field which theoretically decays exponentially. Each TIRF image is actually the projection of a 3-D volume and hence cannot alone produce an accurate localization of structures in the z-dimension, however, it provides greatly improved axial resolution for biological samples. Multiple angle-TIRF microscopy allows controlled variation of the incident angle of the illuminating laser beam, thus generating a set of images of different penetration depths with the potential to reconstruct the 3-D volume of the sample. With the ultimate goal to quantify important biological parameters of microtubules, we present a method to reconstruct 3-D position and orientation of microtubules based on multi-angle TIRF data, as well as experimental calibration of the actual decay function of the evanescent field at each angle. We validate our method using computer simulations, by creating a phantom simulating the curvilinear characteristics of microtubules and project the artificially constructed volume into a set of TIRF image for different penetration depth. The reconstructed depth information for the phantom data is shown to be accurate and robust to noise. We apply our method to microtubule TIRF images of PtK2 cells in vivo. By comparing microtubule curvatures of the reconstruction results and several electron microscopy (EM) images of vertically sliced sample of microtubules, we find that the curvature statistics of our reconstruction agree well with the ground truth (EM data). Quantifying the distribution of microtubule curvature reveals an interesting discovery that microtubules can buckle and form local bendings of considerably small radius of curvature which is also visually spotted on the EM images, while microtubule bendings on a larger scale generally have a much larger radius and cannot bear the stress of a large curvature. The presented method has the potential to provide a- reliable tool for 3-D reconstruction and tracking of microtubules.},

Here, a linear stability approach is successfully developed to describe the thin film evolution which is also compared with experiments. Polystyrene films, with thickness ranging from few tens of nanometers up to several hundred of nanometers were patterned with NanoImprint lithography technique. Atomic force microscopy measurements were used to characterize smooth or steep shapes, respectively. Mechanical measurements of earlier stages of pattern reflow were directly accessible without any assumption, contrary to the diffraction method usually employed. We show that by controlling the reflow process of any complex surface shape during the course of time, measurements of material parameters such as thin film viscosity, surface tension, or even Hamaker constant can be made possible.},

The plasma-treated surfaces were characterized by contact angle measurement, field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. For the sequentially plasma-treated surfaces, additional O"2 plasma treatment makes the surface more hydrophilic, leading to a larger droplet diameter as a result of surface etching. The diameters of the droplets on the surfaces plasma-treated with C"4F"8/O"2 gas mixture increase with raising the O"2 to C"4F"8 volume ratio up to 0.4; however, they tend to decrease at the volume ratio of 0.6 and then increase again with further addition of O"2. Measured contact angles are in good agreement with the variation of droplet diameters. The tendency of variation in morphology and F/C ratio of treated surfaces are also different depending on the plasma treatment process. The combined effects of F/C ratio and surface morphology play a major role in determining the surface wettability.},

Various microstructures were heated in ambient nitrogen gas to study the temperature effect on the thermal shrinkage of PDMS. The ramped heat-up and cool-down speeds of the temperature in ambient nitrogen gas were 10^oC/min to various maximum temperatures and 2^oC/min to room temperature, respectively. The three-dimensional shape of the PDMS structure was observed and measured with a scanning laser microscope. The shrinkage ratios of the PDMS samples heated to 300, 500, and 700^oC were approximately 10%, 13%, and 24%, respectively. There were small variations in shrinkage, which depended on the micropattern dimensions. The higher temperatures, such as 500 and 700^oC, were not optimum for the sequential replica molding process, because of locally cracked and bent shapes as well as increased surface roughness. Therefore, we generated and replicated PDMS molds/stamps using a 300^oC multi-step heat treatment process. During the multi-step heat treatment process, the microstructures became narrower and deeper, which may have been caused by differences in the thermal capacity within the embossed micropatterns region, the PDMS structure, and the curing process of the initial PDMS structure. Thus, the structure width decreased as the depth of the samples increased.},

The whole flowchart comprises the four main parts, of which image registration and image reconstruction are of great significance, materialized the following innovative ideas. Firstly, mutual information measure is combined with morphological gradient information to contain fewer erroneous maxima and lead to the global maximum when registration. Secondly, the hybrid optimizer combined Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Powell algorithm is proposed to restrain local maxima of mutual information function and to improve the registration accuracy. Thirdly, the multiresolution data structure based on Mallat decomposition not only improves the behavior of registration function, but also accelerates the algorithm speed. Finally, an improved Shear-Warp algorithm is proposed based on the sorted volumetric dataset for registered image stack, which can skip all of the transparent voxels and achieve faster speed. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel registration and reconstruction algorithms are effective and efficient to achieve the virtual three-dimensional gekko's cervical spinal cord successfully and the reconstruction result can be rotated, scaled, incised and measured arbitrarily, which is valuable to be applied to the other kinds of serial histology sections.},

abstract = {The local structure of an iron meteorite was analyzed using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and hard x-rays. The x-ray absorption fine-structure spectrum was obtained for each pixel in the PEEM image. The spectrum provides a wide variety of information, e.g., chemical composition, electronic structure, and lattice structure, in the interface region of the Widmanst\"{a}tten structure. The shape of the absorption edge and the radial distribution function indicate that the structural phase changes from body- to face-centered cubic phases as the Ni composition at the interface is increased. The use of PEEM and hard x-rays is an attractive approach for local structure analysis.},

abstract = {The change of the Si(112) surface morphology and structure induced by In adsorption, as well as the impact of In preadsorption on the growth kinetics and island morphology in Ge/Si(112) epitaxy, has been investigated by means of low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction. The intrinsically faceted Si(112) surface is smoothed upon In saturation. In contrast to a previously reported (7 \texttimes{} 1) reconstruction (reported in a recent work of Gai et al.), we observe a [(3 + x) \texttimes{} 1] superstructure, with x ≈ 1/2. This is attributed to the coexistence of (3 \texttimes{} 1) and (4 \texttimes{} 1) building blocks with In vacancies. The presence of such vacancy rows is confirmed by the saturation of the [(3 + x) \texttimes{} 1] structure at about 0.8 monolayers. Ge growth on In-saturated Si(112) leads to the formation of 3-D islands, the morphology of which depends on the growth temperature. At 450°C, isotropic and dashlike islands are observed, whereas at 500°C, larger islands with a triangular outline are found. The orientation of the side facets of these triangular islands have been identified to be (111), (013), and (103). The dependence of the island density on the growth temperature indicates an enhanced Ge surface diffusion, as compared with growth on bare Si(112).},

Depending on growth temperature, various island shapes can be formed. At low temperatures, polygonic islands are formed, consisting of both Ag(001) and Ag(111) crystal orientations. At higher temperatures, islands consist mostly of Ag(111) orientation and are predominantly of triangular shape. As the islands grow, it is possible that the crystalline composition of an island changes. We observed that Ag(001)-oriented areas convert into areas of Ag(111) orientation. The rotational orientation of the Ag islands with respect to the substrate is explained by a modified coincidence-site lattice approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, nanoscale anodic oxidation lithography using an atomic force microscope (AFM) is systematically studied on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Trends between the produced feature size and the corresponding process parameters, such as applied voltage, water meniscus length, tip speed during oxidation (hold time), and humidity are observed. By methodically varying these process parameters, the appropriate working ranges have been found to create features of various sizes based on the oxidation of the CNT structure. We have obtained feature sizes down to 58 nm by setting oxidation time per pixel to 20 ms corresponding to a tip speed of 1.50 μ m/s. Optimizing the tip speed during line scans was found to be critical in maintaining the presence of the water meniscus, which was often found to break above the tip speeds of 1 μm/s. In addition, a comparison of the results from employing this technique between CNT and graphene patterning is illustrated. Other factors affecting the reproducibility of the results are addressed in an endeavor to make the oxidization process more robust and repeatable.},

We perform scanning gate microscopy study to understand the local carrier scattering. It was found that geometric corrugations, defects and edges directly influence the local transport current.

Histology image classification is one of the important tasks in the bio-image informatics field and has broad applications in phenotype description and disease diagnosis. This study proposes a novel framework of histology image classification. The original images are first divided into several blocks and a set of visual features is extracted for each block. An array of C-RSPM Collateral Representative Subspace Projection Modeling models is then built that each model is based on one block from the same location in original images. Finally, the C-Value Enhanced Majority Voting CEWMV algorithm is developed to derive the final classification label for each testing image. To evaluate this framework, the authors compare its performance with several well-known classifiers using the benchmark data available from IICBU data repository. The results demonstrate that this framework achieves promising performance and performs significantly better than other classifiers in the comparison.},

Significant miniaturization of electro mechanical devices using MEMS fabrication technology has encouraged the creation of portable, miniature energy harvesters.

Having self-powered, miniature acoustic sensors allows noise detection monitoring systems to be self-sustaining. This paper illustrates an Aluminium doped Zinc Oxide (AZO) cantilever beam on stainless steel substrate with a top copper electrode. Design and finite element modelling of the design was conducted using Coventorware™. The AZO piezoelectric thin film was RF-sputtered on the stainless steel substrate. Characterizations were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the piezoelectric qualities and surface morphology, respectively. Experimental measurements indicate approximately 345.4 mV AC output voltage (open circuit voltage) is produced at vibration frequencies of 30 kHz. This is in accordance with the Coventorware™ simulation results. This measured power level is sufficient to power a miniature wireless acoustic sensor nodes to monitor noise generated by aircrafts.},

This paper will present results of an improved process based on a new replication machine. Temperature stability and pressure distribution is highly improved, even at reduced cycle times. With an upgraded temperature range microthermoforming of high temperature polymers is possible. This technology is well suited for the replication of three-dimensional micro parts with multiscale features. Replication of hollow parts with multiscale features is also possible. Outer dimension in macroscopic length scale and functional design features in microscopic length scale are combined with nanoscale surface structures in an affordable technology.},

abstract = {In implantable medical systems, low-impedance electrode-tissue interface is important for maintaining signal quality for recording and effective charge transfer for stimulation. In this paper, we propose a novel hemispherical biocompatible and flexible microelectrode arrays (MEAs) which were fabricated by the process of micro electrical mechanical system (MEMS). Compared with conventional planar microelectrodes, the interface impedance of hemispherical microelectrodes decreased due to their increased surface area. Parylene C thin film with good biocompatibility and flexibility was chemical vapor deposited as packaging material for decreasing nerve tissue damage. Pt-black coatings were electroplated by applying current pulses in H2PtCl6 solution on electrode sites for the further decrease of interface impedance. Moreover, the geometrical and electrical properties of these MEAs were demonstrated by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an electrochemical workstation. Experimental results showed that the interface impedance decreased by about 34% compared with conventional planar microelectrodes, and significantly decreased by 84% with Pt-black coatings on electrode sites compared with those uncoated microelectrodes.},

abstract = {Stretching single DNA molecules by confinement in nanofluidic channels has attracted a great interest during the last few years as a DNA analysis tool. We have designed and fabricated a sealed micro/nanofluidic device for DNA stretching applications, based on the use of the high throughput NanoImprint Lithography (NIL) technology combined with a conventional anodic bonding of the silicon base and Pyrex cover. Using this chip, we have performed single molecule imaging on a bench-top fluorescent microscope system. Lambda phage DNA was used as a model sample to characterize the chip. Single molecules of λ-DNA stained with the fluorescent dye YOYO-1 were stretched in the nanochannel array and the experimental results were analysed to determine the extension factor of the DNA in the chip and the geometrical average of the nanochannel inner diameter. The determination of the extension ratio of the chip provides a method to determining DNA size. The results of this work prove that the developed fabrication process is a good alternative for the fabrication of single molecule DNA biochips and it allows developing a variety of innovative bio/chemical sensors based on single-molecule DNA sequencing devices.},

Three-dimensional images of fluorescently labeled collagen are obtained by confocal microscopy, and the network geometry is extracted using a 3D network skeletonization algorithm. Each fiber is modeled as an elastic beam that resists stretching and bending, and each crosslink is modeled as torsional spring. The stress–strain curves of networks at three different densities are compared with rheology measurements. The model shows good agreement with experiment, confirming that strain stiffening of collagen can be explained entirely by geometric realignment of the network, as opposed to entropic stiffening of individual fibers. The model also suggests that at small strains, crosslink deformation is the main contributer to network stiffness, whereas at large strains, fiber stretching dominates. As this modeling effort uses networks with realistic geometries, this analysis can ultimately serve as a tool for understanding how the mechanics of fibers and crosslinks at the microscopic level produce the macroscopic properties of the network. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Simultaneously, we improve the suppression of small, unwanted detail in the background. We extend the theory of attribute filters to hyperconnectivity and provide a fast algorithm to implement the new method. The new version is only marginally slower than the standard Max-Tree algorithm for connected attribute filters, and linear in the number of pixels or voxels. It is two orders of magnitude faster than anisotropic diffusion. The method is implemented in the form of a filtering rule suitable for handling both increasing (size) and nonincreasing (shape) attributes. We test this new framework on nonincreasing shape filters on both 2D images from astronomy, document processing, and microscopy, and 3D CT scans, and show increased robustness to noise while maintaining the advantages of previous methods.},

This method is designed such that it does not violate the practical linear observability condition and, more importantly, it does not require the computationally expensive cross correlation statistics between multiscale variables that are typically needed in standard filtering approach. The proposed filtering algorithm comprises of a ''macro-filter'' that borrows ideas from the Heterogeneous Multiscale Methods and a ''micro-filter'' that reinitializes the fast microscopic variables to statistically reflect the unbiased slow macroscopic estimate obtained from the macro-filter and macroscopic observations at asynchronous times. We will show that the proposed micro-filter is equivalent to solving an inverse problem for parameterizing differential equations. Numerically, we will show that this microscopic reinitialization is an important novel feature for accurate filtered solutions, especially when the microscopic dynamics is not mixing at all.},

Although progress in imaging technology has enabled the automation of cell counting for many different cell types, this process still has to be done manually in the case of images of embryonic stem cells. In this paper, we present a new automatic algorithm to detect and count embryonic stem cells in fluorescence microscopy images that identifies pluripotent stem cells cultured in vitro. Our approach uses luminance information to generate a graph-based image representation. The cell pattern is defined as a subgraph, and a graph-mining process is applied to detect the cells. The method is tolerant to variations in cell size and shape. Moreover, it can easily be parameterized to handle different image groups resulting from distinct differentiation protocols. The paper presents numerical results from tests made on a database with more than two hundred images, including EB cryosection, embryoid body cell migration, murine embryonic stem cell colonies under murine embryonic fibroblast, and neurosphere images. The results from our algorithm were validated by expert biologists, and provide good precision, recall and F-measure. Finally, a comparative study with the widely used watershed algorithm is presented.},

The comparison of IS, Raman, SEM, XRD, and TSC results reveals the increase of the size of nanoparticles upon inducing 1% of Li in Fe2O3 matrix followed by the decrease of the size of nanoparticles in the case of samples with 10% Li, as well as the decrease (increase) of conductivity, respectively. These changes are explained by the structural and morphological changes caused by the impact of Li+ ions in the charge transfers.

The most Al-rich composition of the contact provided a low specific contact resistance (mid 10-8 Ωcm2) upon annealing at 600 °C for 15 s, but it exhibited poor thermal stability due to oxidation of excess elemental Al remaining after annealing, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. On the other hand, less Al-rich contacts required higher annealing temperatures (850 or 900 °C) to reach a minimum specific contact resistance but exhibited better thermal stability. A spread in the specific contact resistance from contact to contact was tentatively attributed to the different facets that were contacted on the GaN nanowires with a triangular cross-section.},

The RuOx metal nanocrystals with an average diameter of 7nm and a highdensity of 0.7\texttimes{}1012/cm2 are observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy after a postdeposition annealing temperature at 1000°. The density of RuOx nanocrystal is decreased (slightly) by increasing the annealing temperatures, due to agglomeration of multiple nanocrystals. The RuO3 nanocrystals and Hf-silicate layer at the SiO2/HfO2 interface are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. For postdeposition annealing temperature of 1000°, the memory capacitors with a small equivalent oxide thickness of ∼9 nm possess a large hysteresis memory window of &gt;5V at a small sweeping gate voltage of ±5V. A promising memory window under a small sweeping gate voltage of ∼3 V is also observed due to charge trapping in the RuOx metal nanocrystals. The program/erase mechanism is modified Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling of the electrons and holes from Si substrate. The electrons and holes are trapped in the RuOx nanocrystals. Excellent program/erase endurance of 106 cycles and a large memory window of 4.3 V with a small charge loss of ∼23% at 85° are observed after 10 years of data retention time, due to the deep-level traps in the RuOx nanocrystals. The memory structure is very promising for future nanoscale nonvolatile memory applications.},

The structure andmorphology of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 powders were characterized to be in the single cubic phase and spherical shape via X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer, and BET surface area testing technique. The average size of particles wasmeasured to be less than 20 nm, and the specific surface area was 85.4m2/g. The TG-DTA investigation was used to reveal the possibly chemical reaction mechanism during the synthesis process. The activity of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 oxide solution in three-way catalysts was also valued in this work.},

The structure of these nanoparticles is investigated using transmission electron microscopy, which shows that the Au nanoparticles are spherical in shape with a narrow size distribution which ranges from 8 to 15 nm. Colloidal dispersion of gold nanoparticles in cyclohexane exhibits absorption bands in the ultraviolet-visible range due to surface plasmon resonance, with absorption maximum at 530 nm. Fluorescence spectra of gold nanoparticles also show an emission peak at 610nm when illuminated at 450 nm. UV-Vis spectroscopy reveals that these nanoparticles remain stable for 10 days.},

The morphology of the nanofiber mat using scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the obtained fiber had an average diameter of around 15-328 nm. The nanofiber was characterized by FTIR spectra, TGA, and DSC. The nanofiber containing drug showed initial fast release. It released about 55% of its drug content within the first two hours. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber containing drug was examined against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus. The nylon-6 nanofiber exhibited high inhibitory effects against the microbes. The results clearly indicate that the antimicrobial activity of the electrospun nylon-6 nanofiber containing drug varies with the species of the organisms used. Thus, the study ascertains the value of the use of electrospun nanofiber, which could be of considerable interest to the development of new antimicrobial materials. The microbes, examined by SEM, were totally deformed and exhibited severe destruction. Abnormal cell division was observed at high frequencies among cells that tried to divide in the presence of the nanofiber. Many cells were enlarged, elongated, empty ghosts, or fragmented, consistent with the extremely low viability.},

The three observed Raman peaks at 475, 633, and 774 cm-1 indicate the typical rutile structure of the SnO2, which is in agreement with the X-ray diffraction results, and other peaks of impurity are not found. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the nanobelts have a high degree of crystallinity, without typical imperfects in it.

The structure and morphology were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, while the scintillation properties of the nanoparticles were determined by means of X-ray and 241 Am irradiation. The unique aspect of scintillation of nanoparticles is related to the migration of carriers in the nanoscintillator. Our results showed that even nanoparticles as small as ∼4nm in size effectively scintillate, despite the diffusion length of e-h pairs being considerably larger than the nanoparticles themselves, and suggest that nanoparticles can be used for radiation detection.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, polymer/clay nanocomposites have been an area of intensive research due to their capacity to improve the properties of the polymer resin. These nanocharged polymers exhibit a complex rheological behavior due to their dispersed structure in the matrix. Thus, to gain fundamental understanding of nanocomposite dispersion, characterization of their internal structure and their rheological behavior is crucial. Such understanding is also key to determine the manufacturing conditions to produce these nanomaterials by liquid composite molding (LCM) process. This paper investigates the mix of nanoclays particles in an unsaturated polyester resin using three different dispersion techniques: manual mixing, sonication, and high shear mixing (HSM). This paper shows that the mixing method has a significant effect on the sample morphology. Rheology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) characterization techniques were used to analyze the blends morphology and evaluate the nanoclays stacks/polymer matrix interaction. Several phenomena, such as shear thinning and premature polymer gelification, were notably observed.},

This paper presents two procedures that successfully produce a powder consisting of equiaxed zinc oxide nanoparticles: one using a polyethylene glycol- (PEG-) assisted solvothermal method and the other by calcination of zinc oxalate obtained from a microemulsion-mediated method. In the latter, zinc-substituted aerosol OT (AOT) is used as a surfactant. The samples are characterized by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Both synthesis techniques produce nanoparticles with similar sizes in the range of 10 to 20 nm. Dense aggregates observed in the calcined powder are infrequent in the case of the solvothermal method.},

The structural and morphological characterization shows that the CoO has cubic face (fcc) and the particles deposited uniformly on the external surface of the carbon nanotubes. In the annealed materials, the NMR shows that the fcc and hcp metallic Co phases coexist with a significant percentage of stacking faults. The magnetic measurements indicated that the CoO/MWNTs composite is largely composed of CoO nanoparticles with uncompensated surface spins.

In vitro sucrose increases protein stability and forces partially unfolded structures to refold. Thin films of sucrose (C12H22O11) were deposited on thin cut glass substrates by the thermal evaporation technique (P ∼ 10-5 torr). Characteristics of thin films were put into evidence by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential thermal analysis and thermal gravimetric analysis (TG/DTA). The experimental results confirm a uniform deposition of an adherent layer. In this paper we present a part of the characteristics of sucrose thin films deposited on glass in medium vacuum conditions, as a part of a culture medium for osteoblast cells. Osteoblast cells were used to determine proliferation, viability, and cytotoxicity interactions with sucrose powder and sucrose thin films. The osteoblast cells have been provided from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Centre. The outcome of this study demonstrated the effectiveness of sucrose thin films as a possible nontoxic agent for biomedical applications.},

Two concentrations of aqueous solution of precipitating agent sodium hydroxide were used under different dosing times on microemulsion. Characterization by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy allowed us to identify particles with an acicular rod-like morphology and a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure as small as 8.5 and 30nm in average diameter and length, respectively. Productivities much higher than those typical in the preparation of zinc oxide nanoparticles via reverse microemulsions were obtained. Particle size was the same at the two studied sodium hydroxide concentrations, while it increases as dosing time of the precipitant agent increases. It is believed that the surfactant film on the microemulsion channels restricts the particle diameter growth.},

By introducing a thermal-annealing process above the glass-transition temperature of poly (methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), the profile of indented nanopatterns has been dramatically improved by abatement of the tip-induced debris. This eliminates the main problem of the previous AFM-based tip-ploughing lithography method, namely the debris formation during the nanoplough and trench refilling by debris. We are able to reproducibly fabricate nanopatterns down to 40 nm. Meanwhile, the AFM-tip lifetime has been increased substantially. In particular, the adhesion between the PMMA layer on the edge of trenches and the substrate is significantly improved to enable reliable pattern transfer into GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures by wet-chemical etching. Functional nanodevices with a lateral feature size of 100 nm to an etching depth of 70 nm are demonstrated using the method.},

In order to evaluate the SAW characteristics of ZnO films on a 3C-SiC buffer layer, the two-port SAW resonators, based on inter-digital transducer (IDT)/ZnO/3C-SiC/Si and IDT/ZnO/Si structures, were fabricated and measured within a temperature range of 25-135^oC. The resulting 3C-SiC buffer layer improved the insertion loss by approximately 7.3dB within the SAW resonator and enhanced the temperature stability with TCF=-22ppm/^oC up to 135^oC in comparison to that of TCF=-45ppm/^oC within a temperature range of 25-115^oC of the ZnO/Si structure.},

The task of comparing these two approaches and explaining how they are related is a major challenge for applied mathematics. It is known that kinetic models such as the Boltzmann and Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equations can theoretically yield continuum models such as the equations of Euler or Navier-Stokes via the Hilbert and Chapman-Enskog expansions. Despite these theoretical results, mathematical modeling using the kinetic approach is not straightforward, in particular when it comes to numerical approximations. Various difficulties arise when attempting to adopt an appropriate kinetic numerical algorithm to obtain results comparable to solutions of continuum models. In this work we address a small aspect of this problem. The one-dimensional Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation and its shock forming initial and boundary conditions are considered. A numerical algorithm to simulate a shock formation is developed, discussed and the results are compared to a similar process based on a continuum model. Both approaches are evaluated and compared numerically.},

abstract = {This paper reports an in-depth study of a hybrid microassembly technique that combines a robotic micromanipulator and a water droplet self-alignment, which greatly improves the performance of robotic microassembly. The method is experimentally studied on a custom-made microrobotic test platform adapted for the experiments. Four important measures of the microassembly technique are investigated--yield, capability, accuracy, and speed. Yield is studied by a large number of tests with random process parameters and statistical-modeling methods. Accuracy is measured by studying the final assembly results under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Capability is assessed by testing parts of various sizes and shapes. Using a high-speed camera, the duration and trajectories of droplet self-alignment of the hybrid assembly process are studied. The experimental results indicate that such a hybrid assembly technique has very low requirements on the precision, which is comparable with the dimensions of the micropart, of the handling robot while being able to achieve micrometer precision. Moreover, successful assembly can be easily achieved with part sizes that range from 50 to 300 µm. The experiments also show that parts of different sizes can be reliably assembled together using the proposed method.},

abstract = {The tip asymmetry of a bevel-tip needle results in the needle naturally bending when it is inserted into soft tissue. This enables robotic needle steering, which can be used in medical procedures to reach subsurface targets inaccessible by straight-line trajectories. However, accurate path planning and control of needle steering require models of needle-tissue interaction. Previous kinematic models required empirical observations of each needle and tissue combination in order to fit model parameters. This study describes a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, which can be used to predict needle behavior and optimize system design based on fundamental mechanical and geometrical properties of the needle and tissue. We first present an analytical model for the loads developed at the tip, based on the geometry of the bevel edge and material properties of soft-tissue simulants (gels). We then present a mechanics-based model that calculates the deflection of a bevel-tipped needle inserted through a soft elastic medium. The model design is guided by microscopic observations of needle-gel interactions. The energy-based formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters, and the geometry and material properties of the needle. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in experimental studies of robotic needle insertion.},

abstract = {Multiscale resolution imaging and manipulation are essential for applications ranging from defect screening in circuits to nanoscale manipulation, patterning, and lithography. In this paper, we introduce a variant of scanning thermal microscopy to image surfaces at both the micro- and nanoscale. Electrothermal imaging at the microscale is performed in a completely out-of-contact, i.e., “noncontact” or “off-contact,” mode with a microscale heater, followed by higher resolution nanoscale imaging in contact mode with a nanoscale probe tip. Using this methodology, the imaging and manipulation functions of a single probe can be decoupled completely. This off-contact imaging mode is useful for avoiding tip wear and can be performed safely at high velocities. We demonstrate imaging of microscale features at speeds of up to 2 mm/s. The lateral resolution is determined by the dimensions of the heater used for imaging. For the flying heights and heater dimensions used here, the 1-σ lateral spatial resolution limit in the off-contact mode is less than 10 μm for 10-nm-tall features. A silicon nanowire attached to microscale electrodes is imaged to demonstrate the efficacy of this scheme.},

We have just started to comprehend the true reality of the structures of our universe, planet Earth, and the human mind and body. In superstring theory the final elements of an atom are superstrings, which are microscopically tiny continuously vibrating loops of energy. The way in which the string vibrates in space-time and the geometry of the space-time determine the properties of the elementary particle. The latest scientific research and discoveries validate the undeniable strong effect of vibrational frequencies on the human body, especially the brain. Recent studies by the renowned neuroscientist Dr. Llin's Chair, Neuroscience &amp; Physiology, N.Y.U. School of Medicine have shown that abnormal brain rhythms actually explain a variety of medical disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, tinnitus, and depression. It is likely that deep brain stimulation, or the implantation of electrodes into particular regions of the brain, works due to changing the abnormal rhythms. Therefore, the transdisciplinary approach to science and technology is necessary for further studies directed towards the recognition and use of vibrational frequencies to treat and cure different disorders in the human body and mind, and in general to develop new technology and tools to achieve desired functions in our planet and universe.},

In this paper the medium is a three-dimensional small-scale randomly layered medium with slow macroscopic variations. The main objective here is to set forth a framework for analysis of cross correlations of waves generated by noise sources and propagating in such a medium and, moreover, to use this framework to design estimators for macroscale medium features. The noise sources are located at the bottom of a random medium slab and generate a random wave field that is scattered by the rapid random fluctuations of the medium and then recorded at the surface. Taking into account the pressure release boundary conditions at the surface, this situation corresponds to the so-called daylight configuration. The analysis is carried out in the asymptotic framework where the typical wavelength is small compared to the scale of the macroscopic variations of the background medium and large compared to the decoherence length of the microscopic random fluctuations of the medium. It is shown that the cross correlation of the waves recorded at the surface contains statistically stable information about the macroscopic background medium.},

abstract = {One of the captivating characteristics of social insects, in spite of their rudimentary individual constitution, is the ability by which they have to solve complicated problems in an elastic and robust way. This includes elasticity which ensures the adaptation of the insect system to the unpredictable changes of their environment, and robustness which guarantees a functioning continuity of the system, in spite of the possible failure of a certain number of its elements in the achievement of their individual missions. From this point of view, fields of research have emerged over the past decades, with the aim of trying to reveal the secret behind the relationship between individual and society, so perfectly designed in nature. Collective robotics is one of those fields where we try to find microscopic rules allowing a group of autonomous robots, mobile and with limited capacity, to carry out a specific macro-task, such as exclusive positioned heap formation. The idea, behind this, is to use a model of oriented reactive agent simulation, to seek the relations which can link the local perceptions of the simulated robots with their basic actions, in order to make the above mentioned gathering task a success. An evolutionary approach is used for this purpose, making it possible to discover the functional control relations of these simulated robots. An analogy with the precepts specific to the ant community is established and results of simulation indicating the effectiveness of the detected rules are presented.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenge of realizing full-body behaviors in scalable modular robots. We present an experimental study of a biologically inspired approach to organize the morphology and control of modular robots. The approach introduces a nested hierarchy that decomposes the complexity of assembling and commanding a functional robot made of numerous simple modules. The purpose is to support versatility, scalability, and provide design abstraction. The robots we describe incorporate anatomy-inspired parts such as muscles, bones, and joints, and these parts in turn are assembled from modules. Each of those parts encapsulates one or more functions, e.g., a muscle can contract. Control of the robot can then be cast as a problem of controlling its anatomical parts rather than each discrete module. To validate this approach, we perform experiments with micron-scale spherical catom modules in simulation. The robots we simulate are increasingly complex and include snake, crawler, quadruped, cilia surface, arm-joint-muscle, and grasping robots. We conclude that this is a promising approach for future microscopic many-modules systems, but also that it is not applicable to relatively weak and slow homogeneous systems such as the centimeter-scale ATRON.},

abstract = {Out-of-plane microlens, as its in-plane counterpart, is an important micro optics component that can be used in building integrated micro-optic systems for many applications. In earlier publications from our group, an ultra violet (UV) lithography based technique for out-of-plane microlens fabrication was reported. In this paper, we report a replication technology for time-efficient fabrication of out-of-plane microlens made of a curable polymer, NOA73. Microlens of cured SU-8 polymer was fabricated using a unique tilted UV lithography process, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was molded using the resulting SU-8 master to form a negative mold, curable polymer NOA73 was then casted in the PDMS mold and out-of-plane microlens replica made of NOA73 was finally obtained after curing. The entire replication process took less than 5 h. Since PDMS negative mold was reusable, multiple replications of the microlens could be done with the same mold and each replication only took about 30 min. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images showed that NOA73 microlens replica had almost identical shape as the SU-8 master. In Comparison to the SU-8 microlens, microlens replica of UV curable polymer had slightly longer focal length and smaller numerical aperture due to the lower refractive index of NOA73. In addition, NOA73 microlens replica also had improved spectral transmission. Because of its compatibility with soft lithography technique, the reported replication process may also be used to integrate out-of-plane microlens into micro-opto-electro-mechanical-systems (MOEMS) and BioMEMS chips.},

The optical microscope and alpha-stepper profiler were used to examine the morphology and profile of LGP microstructure. The optical luminance and uniformity of LGP were measured using BM9 luminance meter in comparison with commercial product. The light uniformity and luminance of the cone-like LGP microstructure reach 75---80% and 2,800---3,000 cd/cm2, respectively which meet the requirements of commercial LGP.},

Firstly, we detail the mathematical model written as a conservative hyperbolic partial differentiel system of equations, and then we recall how to obtain the corresponding kinetic formulation. Then we build the kinetic scheme ensuring an upwinding of the source term due to the topography performed in a close manner described by Perthame and Simeoni (2001) [1] and Botchorishvili et al. (2003) [2] using an energetic balance at microscopic level. The validation is lastly performed in the case of a water hammer in an uniform pipe: we compare the numerical results provided by an industrial code used at EDF-CIH (France), which solves the Allievi equation (the commonly used equation for pressurised flows in pipes) by the method of characteristics, with those of the kinetic scheme. It appears that they are in a very good agreement.},

abstract = {Motivation: Single-particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) typically produces density maps of macromolecular assemblies at intermediate to low resolution (~5–30 \r{A}). By fitting high-resolution structures of assembly components into these maps, pseudo-atomic models can be obtained. Optimizing the quality-of-fit of all components simultaneously is challenging due to the large search space that makes the exhaustive search over all possible component configurations computationally unfeasible.Results: We developed an efficient mathematical programming algorithm that simultaneously fits all component structures into an assembly density map. The fitting is formulated as a point set matching problem involving several point sets that represent component and assembly densities at a reduced complexity level. In contrast to other point matching algorithms, our algorithm is able to match multiple point sets simultaneously and not only based on their geometrical equivalence, but also based on the similarity of the density in the immediate point neighborhood. In addition, we present an efficient refinement method based on the Iterative Closest Point registration algorithm. The integer quadratic programming method generates an assembly configuration in a few seconds. This efficiency allows the generation of an ensemble of candidate solutions that can be assessed by an independent scoring function. We benchmarked the method using simulated density maps of 11 protein assemblies at 20 \r{A}, and an experimental cryoEM map at 23.5 \r{A} resolution. Our method was able to generate assembly structures with root-mean-square errors &lt;6.5 \r{A}, which have been further reduced to &lt;1.8 \r{A} by the local refinement procedure.Availability: The program is available upon request as a Matlab code package.Contact:alber@usc.edu and m.topf@cryst.bbk.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Online.},

Only by combining all these techniques for analysing TaNx films synthesised with varying nitrogen content in the deposition chamber can a proper evaluation of the microstructure and the chemical composition be done.

Better quality and reproducibility of apertures are demonstrated through optical throughput measurement of the probes. The fabrication of apertures having complex shapes is also demonstrated. The process includes such novel elements as the use of local oxidation of silicon and the use of an aluminium - compatible release etch.

This study aims to correlate hemodynamics with wall histology and wall mechanics by examining the flow field in AVS with computational fluid dynamics using experimental data taken from in vivo experiments. Input data to the computational model were obtained in vivo one month after AVS creation; adjacent vessels were submitted to histological and mechanical examination. The 3-D shunt geometry was determined using biplane angiography. Ultrasound measurements of flow rates were performed with perivascular flow probes and pressures were recorded through intravascular catheters. These data were considered as boundary conditions for calculation of the unsteady flow field. Numerical findings are suggestive of strong Dean vortices toward both vein flow exits, verified by color Doppler. The high wall shear stresses (WSSs) and their gradients appear to be related to areas of IH and vessel wall stiffening, as evidenced in preliminary histological and mechanical studies of the venous wall. Additionally, suture line hyperplasia seems to be aggravated by the high WSS gradients noted at the transition line from graft to vein.},

abstract = {The growth behavior of plasma enhanced atomic layer deposited (PEALD) ruthenium (Ru) thin film was systematically studied in the context of its application to a copper diffusion barrier. The Ru layer was grown on bare Si and a 30nm bottom wide nano-patterned trench with an aspect ratio of 4. Bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium [Ru(EtCp)"2] was used as a precursor and NH"3 was used as a plasma enhanced reactant, respectively. To obtain optimal deposition conditions, a Ru thin film was grown on non-patterned bare Si and ALD grown TaN substrate. The process parameters were precisely controlled, resulting in a uniform Ru film layer at 8-inch full wafer scale with a growth temperature of 290^oC and 230mTorr of working pressure. The experimental results showed typical ALD grown thin film characteristics with a linear relation between film thickness and number of cycles. The growth rate was saturated at 0.35A/cycle for TaN and 0.33A/cycle for Ru. Based on the optimal conditions obtained from the non-patterned wafer, Ru thin film was deposited on 30nm bottom width nano-patterned Si and TaN/Si trench with an aspect ratio of 4 to investigate the conformity. The conformity was measured to be 0.86 on Si and 0.97 on the TaN/Si trench, which indicates excellent step coverage. The physical properties of the Ru/TaN bilayer studied by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that a dense amorphous phase Ru thin film layer was successfully grown using PEALD. Our study indicated that reliable self-limited ALD characteristics and excellent conformal deposition of the Ru/TaN bilayer on both bare substrate and the 30nm wide nano-patterned trench.},

abstract = {The ground-state helium-4 beam employed by the microscopy technique discussed in this article interacts exclusively with the atoms in the topmost sample-monolayer. Its low-energy (tens of meV) and chemical inertness make the beam an almost 'ideal' imaging probe in the sense that a sample surface can be imaged without alteration by the probe. The microscopy technique therefore has promising applications in the imaging of fragile samples and metrology. In this article we present a fabrication process for the diffraction-based focusing element (Fresnel Zoneplate) in such a setup. Zoneplates made previously for this purpose have suffered from low transmission, a problem we have solved with our new process. In addition, we have measured the first-order diffraction efficiency of three zoneplates fabricated with this process. The efficiency of a zoneplate with 388@mm diameter was close to 70% of the theoretically predicted value. We believe the reduction stems mainly from misalignment between the writefields used to pattern the zoneplate. The fabricated zoneplates of 190@mm diameter, which we patterned using a single writefield, have close to the theoretically predicted transmission characteristics; a result that has not been achieved before for neutral atom Fresnel lenses.},

abstract = {Pathological examination of a biopsy is the most reliable and widely used technique to diagnose bone cancer. However, it suffers from both inter- and intra- observer subjectivity. Techniques for automated tissue modeling and classification can reduce this subjectivity and increases the accuracy of bone cancer diagnosis. This paper presents a graph theoretical method, called extracellular matrix (ECM)-aware cell-graph mining, that combines the ECM formation with the distribution of cells in hematoxylin and eosin stained histopathological images of bone tissues samples. This method can identify different types of cells that coexist in the same tissue as a result of its functional state. Thus, it models the structure-function relationships more precisely and classifies bone tissue samples accurately for cancer diagnosis. The tissue images are segmented, using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, to compute spatial coordinates of cell nuclei as the nodes of corresponding cell-graph. Upon segmentation a color code is assigned to each node based on the composition of its surrounding ECM. An edge is hypothesized (and established) between a pair of nodes if the corresponding cell membranes are in physical contact and if they share the same color. Hence, multiple colored-cell-graphs coexist in a tissue each modeling a different cell-type organization. Both topological and spectral features of ECM-aware cell-graphs are computed to quantify the structural properties of tissue samples and classify their different functional states as healthy, fractured, or cancerous using support vector machines. Classification accuracy comparison to related work shows that the ECM-aware cell-graph approach yields 90.0% whereas Delaunay triangulation and the simple cell-graph approach achieves 75.0 and 81.1% accuracy, respectively.},

They are caused by traffic incidents such as accidents, disabled cars, construction activities and other unusual events. Three different major traffic conditions can be occurred: "Flow," "Dense" and "Congested". Objective of this research is to identify the current traffic condition by examining the traffic measurement parameters. The earlier researches have dealt only with speed and volume by ignoring occupancy. In our study, the occupancy is another important parameter of classification. The previous works have used multiple sensors to classify traffic condition whereas our work uses only single microwave sensor. We have extended Multiple Linear Regression classification with our new approach of Estimating with Error Prediction. We present novel algorithms of Multiclassification with One-Against-All Method and Multiclassification with Binary Comparison for multiple SVM architecture. Finaly, a non-linear model of backpropagation neural network is introduced for classification. This combination has not been reported on previous studies. Training data are obtained from the Corsim based microscopic traffic simulator TSIS 5.1. All performances are compared using this data set. Our methods are currently installed and running at traffic management center of 2.Ring Road in Istanbul.},

abstract = {Si"xCr"yC"zB"v thin films with several compositions have been studied for integration of high precision resistors in 0.8@mm BICMOS technology. These resistors, integrated in the back-end of line, have the advantage to provide high level of integration and attractive electrical behavior in temperature, for analog devices. The film morphology and the structure have been investigated through transmission electron microscopy analysis and have been then related to the electrical properties on the base of the percolation theory. According to this theory, and in agreement with experimental results, negative thermal coefficient of resistance (TCR) has been obtained for samples with low Cr content, corresponding to a crystalline volume fraction below the percolation threshold. Samples with higher Cr content exhibit, instead, a variation of the TCR as a function of film thickness: negative TCR values are obtained for thickness lower than 5nm, corresponding to a crystalline volume fraction below the percolation threshold; positive TCR are obtained for larger thickness, indicating the establishment of a continuous conductive path between the Cr rich grains. This property seems to be determinant in order to assure the possibility to obtain thin film resistors almost independent on the temperature.},

abstract = {Titanium oxide (TiO"2) has been extensively applied in the medical area due to its proved biocompatibility with human cells [1]. This work presents the characterization of titanium oxide thin films as a potential dielectric to be applied in ion sensitive field-effect transistors. The films were obtained by rapid thermal oxidation and annealing (at 300, 600, 960 and 1200^oC) of thin titanium films of different thicknesses (5nm, 10nm and 20nm) deposited by e-beam evaporation on silicon wafers. These films were analyzed as-deposited and after annealing in forming gas for 25min by Ellipsometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman Spectroscopy (RAMAN), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Ti-K edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES). Thin film thickness, roughness, surface grain sizes, refractive indexes and oxygen concentration depend on the oxidation and annealing temperature. Structural characterization showed mainly presence of the crystalline rutile phase, however, other oxides such Ti"2O"3, an interfacial SiO"2 layer between the dielectric and the substrate and the anatase crystalline phase of TiO"2 films were also identified. Electrical characteristics were obtained by means of I-V and C-V measured curves of Al/Si/TiO"x/Al capacitors. These curves showed that the films had high dielectric constants between 12 and 33, interface charge density of about 10^1^0/cm^2 and leakage current density between 1 and 10^-^4A/cm^2. Field-effect transistors were fabricated in order to analyze I"DxV"D"S and logI"DxBias curves. Early voltage value of -1629V, R"O"U"T value of 215M@W and slope of 100mV/dec were determined for the 20nm TiO"x film thermally treated at 960^oC.},

abstract = {Automated cell phenotype image classification is related to the problem of determining locations of protein expression within living cells. Localization of proteins in cells is directly related to their functions and it is crucial for several applications ranging from early diagnosis of a disease to monitoring of therapeutic effectiveness of drugs. Recent advances in imaging instruments and biological reagents have allowed fluorescence microscopy to be extensively used as a tool to understand biology at the cellular level by means of the visualization of biological activity within cells. However, human classification of fluorescence cell micrographs is still subjective and very time consuming, thus an automated approach for the systematic determination of protein subcellular locations from fluorescence microscopy images is required. Existing approaches concentrated on designing a set of optimal features and then applying standard machine-learning algorithms. This paper takes into consideration the best methods proposed in the literature and focuses on the study of ensemble machine learning techniques for cell phenotype image classification. Two techniques are tested for the classification: a random subspace of Levenberg-Marquardt neural networks and a variant of the AdaBoost. Each of these two methods are tested with different feature sets, moreover the fusion between the two ensembles is studied. The best ensemble tested in this work obtains an outstanding 97.5% accuracy in the 2D-Hela dataset, which to the best of our knowledge is the best performance obtained on this dataset (the most used benchmark for comparing automated cell phenotype image classification approaches).},

abstract = {Ta-Si-N thin films were fabricated by using reactive magnetron cosputtering at different Si/Ta power ratios and nitrogen (N"2) to total gas (Ar+N"2) flow ratios (FN"2%=FN"2/(FAr+FN"2)x100%). Both levels of high-vacuum furnace annealing (FA) and low vacuum rapid thermal annealing (RTA) were performed to investigate the thermal stability of films. The microstructure, morphology and electrical property of the Ta-Si-N thin films were characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and four-point probe method, respectively. Ta-Si-N thin films at low FN"2% could endure temperature up to 900^oC for 1h under high-vacuum FA at 6.5x10^-^3Pa while their phase and morphology had changed under RTA at 750-900^oC for 1min at 2.6Pa. The resistivity increased with increasing both FN"2% and Si/Ta power ratios. However, the variation percentage of resistivity of Ta-Si-N films at high-temperature annealing decreased with increasing Si/Ta power ratio and inversely increased with increasing FN"2%. In brief, the thermal stability of Ta-Si-N films increased with increasing level of vacuum and Si/Ta power ratio. Increasing FN"2% and Si/Ta power ratio could enhance the thermal stability of films at RTA but also increased the resisitivity of films. Therefore, Ta-Si-N films prepared at 2 FN"2% and Si/Ta power ratio of 2/1 can be a good candidate for the application of diffusion barrier with low resistivity, low variation percentage and high stability of microstructure.},

In addition to the differences in nanoindentation loading-unloading curve shapes, nanohardness values associated with the cracked contact surfaces were 40% lower.

abstract = {To achieve a magnetic recording density of 1 Tb/in2, the required head-disk spacing is expected to be less than 2---3 nm. However, a critical issue in achieving such an ultra-low spacing is the dynamic instability of the head-disk interface (HDI), that is, the experimentally observed hysteresis of the flying sliders. It is important to clarify the interactive forces between the sliders and disk surfaces in a nanometer HDI. In addition, the adhesive forces between the thermally protruding magnetic head writer pole tip, which exists in the most commercially available recording head, and the lubricant film have also become very important. Therefore, in this study, the interactions between the probes of an environmentally controlled atomic force microscope (AFM) and ultra-thin liquid lubricant films were studied as a model experiment, resulting in the acquisition of fundamental knowledge related to the adhesive forces as well as the slider hysteresis. Subsequently, the effect of humidity on the force curve characteristics was investigated by varying the lubricant film thickness. As a result, it was found that the probe touchdown occurred earlier as the humidity increased, with its driving force suggested to be the force of the lubricant meniscus formed on the AFM probe. The probe touchdown occurred earlier for lubricants with a higher mobility. The adhesive force gradually increased with the humidity and was at its minimum for a one monolayer film thickness, independent of the lubricant materials. On the other hand, the elongation of the lubricant meniscus increased with the humidity. Therefore, the probe takeoff occurred later as the humidity increased. Accordingly, the hysteresis increased with the humidity and was mainly dependent on the elongation of the meniscus.},

abstract = {A novel and simple chemical method was developed to fastly synthesize Au nanoplates with size of micrometers and tens of nanometers in thickness. The synthesis was carried out within 30 minutes by thermal reduction of precursors (HAuCl4) in the presence of binary surfactants Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in ethylene glycol (EG) solution. The presence and concentration of PVP and CTAB in the growth solution play important roles in the fast formation of Au nanoplates. The obtained Au nanoplates exhibit strong surface plasmon absorption in the near-infrared region (NIR), displaying a considerable dependence on the shape and size. Characterizations by Transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffraction indicated that the nanoplates are single crystals with (111) planes as two basal surfaces. Explanations for the nuclei formation and crystal growth behind anisotropic Au nanoplates were proposed.},

abstract = {Gold nanostructures with shapes of rod, dumbbells, and dog bone have been fabricated by an improved seed-mediated method. It is found that the pH change (the addition of HNO3 or HCl) and the presence of Ag+ ions have a great influence on the growth process and aspect ratios of these Au nanocrystals. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra for the Au colloidal show that the transverse plasmon absorption band locates at ∼520 nm, while the longitudinal plasmon absorption band shifts in a wide spectra region of 750-1100 nm. The obtained Au nanostructures have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffractometer. Based on the characterizations and FDTD simulations, most of the obtained Au nanorods are single crystals, possessing an octagonal cross-section bounded by {110} and {100} faces. One model for the anisotropic growth has been proposed. It is found that slow kinetics favor the formation of single-crystalline Au nanorods.},

The results showed that CDTs can enter into cytoplasm of L02 cell via endocytosis and nonendocytic ways. Large aggregation of CDTs went into cell by endocytosis and finally formed an endocytic vesicle with membrane boundary. Tiny aggregation of CDTs entered into cell cytoplasm via channels similar to that for lung-blood substance exchange in the alveolar-airway barrier. In addition, tiny aggregation of CDTs was observed in nucleus, and maybe CDTs could pass through the nucleus envelope via the channels provided by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Results from MTT assay, fluorescence microscope, and TEM observations showed that the cell viability, cell morphology, cell growth, and cell division periods could not be obviously impaired when cells were exposed to CDTs of different concentration from30 to 150 µgmL-1 without UV irradiation. However, large vacuoles containing CDTs were found in cytoplasm, some structure changes were observed in mitochondria, and smooth envelope around the nucleus was shrank and deformed.},

abstract = {TiO2 thin films were deposited on unheated silicon wafers (100) and glass slides by a pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system. The effects of both an operating pressure and deposition time on film structure, surface morphology, and optical property were studied. The film structure and microstructure were characterized by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) technique and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surface morphology was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The optical property of the TiO2 thin films was determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The water contact angle measurement was also used to determine hydrophilicity of the films after exposed to UV light. The results suggested that the TiO2 thin film at less than 40 nm was amorphous. As the thickness was increased, the mixture of anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 began to form. By reducing the operating pressure during the film deposition, the rutile phase component can also be enhanced. Both the increased film thickness and decrease operating pressure were the critical factors to improve the hydrophilicity of the TiO2 thin films.},

In this study, we report a new method for the deposition and growth of 2,2- biimidazole-based nanorods on mica substrates by employing a complex solution of silver nitrate (I) and 2,2-biimidazole. The morphology and electrical polarizability of the prepared nanorods are investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and noncontact electrostatic force microscopy (EFM). The experimental results show highly polarizable and singly separated nanorods oriented in three preponderant directions. In addition, we show that the active K+ ions on the mica surface are required for the formation of these nanorods. Additionally, these potassium ions are a critical factor in controlling the nucleation and morphology of nanostructures.},

Thermal properties of these composite materials have been studied as a function of silica, indicating that thermal stability of the chitosan film is enhanced. Dynamical mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) has been carried out to measure the shift in the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the composites from the maxima of the α transition curves. The glass transition temperature and the storage modulus show an increase with increasing silica content. The maximum increase in the Tg value, that is, 159.37°C, is seen with 30 wt% silica. A gradual increase of 3.0 GPa in the modulus relative to the pure polymer is observed.},

Nanocomposites are fabricated by mixing the clay particles using various combinations of mechanical mixing, high-shear dispersion, and ultrasonication. Clay morphology is characterized using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Specimens of both neat epoxy and the epoxy-clay nanocomposite are subjected to two environmental conditions: combined UV radiation and condensation on 3-hour repeat cycle and constant temperature-humidity, for a total exposure duration of 4770 hours. The presence of nanoscale clay inhibits moisture uptake, as demonstrated by exposure to constant temperature-humidity. Nonetheless, both materials lose mass under exposure to combined UV radiation and condensation due to the erosion of epoxy by a synergistic process. Surprisingly, the epoxy-clay specimens exhibit greater mass loss, as compared to neat epoxy. Mechanical testing shows that either environment does not significant affect the flexure modulus of either material. On the other hand, both materials undergo degradation in flexural strength when exposed to either environment. However, the epoxy-clay nanocomposite retains 37% more flexure strength than the neat epoxy after 4072 hours of exposure.},

The understanding of virus formation, evolution, stability, and interaction with host cells is of great importance to the scientific community and public health. Typically, a virus complex in association with its aquatic environment poses a fabulous challenge to theoretical description and prediction. In this work, we propose a differential geometry-based multiscale paradigm to model complex biomolecule systems. In our approach, the differential geometry theory of surfaces and geometric measure theory are employed as a natural means to couple the macroscopic continuum domain of the fluid mechanical description of the aquatic environment from the microscopic discrete domain of the atomistic description of the biomolecule. A multiscale action functional is constructed as a unified framework to derive the governing equations for the dynamics of different scales. We show that the classical Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid dynamics and Newton's equation for the molecular dynamics can be derived from the least action principle. These equations are coupled through the continuum-discrete interface whose dynamics is governed by potential driven geometric flows.},

abstract = {This paper reports a processing technology of natural nanorod materials. Palygorskite is a type of natural nanorod hydrous clay mineral, and its basic unit is about 20-40 nm in diameter and 1-5 ??m in length. Low-cost single crystals of palygorskite can be produced in mass by simply adding freeze process into traditional extrusion treatment. The dispersion state of palygorskite was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size distribution, SEM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and viscosity techniques. The effects of the freeze process and treatment time on the dispersive quality of palygorskite were also studied. The results indicated that the new approach was efficient to disperse palygorskite ore into nanometer-scale particles and the crystal bundles of palygorskite into single crystals. Moreover, the new approach had much lower breakage of the long fine fiber of palygorskite compared with the dry process. The freeze process had remarkable influence on the improvement of the dispersion of palygorskite ore. The viscosity of the sample treated with the freeze process was enhanced twice from 472 to 3894 mpa??s, which was about 2.6 times that of the sample treated without the freeze process. The treated samples showed very uniform fibers about 20-40 nm in width and 1-5 ??m in length, as observed from TEM, which is in good agreement with the perfect rod-shaped crystals of palygorskite. In addition, the treated samples showed XRD patterns similar to that of the untreated palygorskite ore, which suggests that the treated samples retained their original structure.},

abstract = {The local electrical conductivity of aluminum thin film with dimensions from micron to submicron was quantitatively measured by a four-point atomic force microscope (AFM) technique. The technique is a combination of the principles of four-point probe method and standard AFM. A silicon nitride based AFM probe with a V-shaped two-dimensional sliced structure tip was patterned by using conventional photolithography method. The probe was then etched to four parallel electrodes isolated from each other, for the purpose of performing current input and electrical potential drop measurement. The spacing between electrodes is smaller than 1.0 μm, which facilitates the quantitative electrical conductivity measurement of ultrathin film. The four-point AFM probe technique is capable of measuring surface topography together with local conductivity simultaneously. The technique was applied to a series of 99.999% aluminum thin films with thicknesses from micron to submicron. The repeatable measurements demonstrate the capability of this technique and its possible extension to be used for fast in situ electrical properties characterization of submicron interconnects that widely applied in nanosensors and nanodevices.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for real-time highway traffic condition assessment using vehicle kinetic information, which is likely to be made available from vehicle-infrastructure integration (VII) systems, in which vehicle and infrastructure agents communicate to improve mobility and safety. In the proposed VII framework, the vehicle onboard equipment and roadside units (RSUs) collaboratively work, supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm, to determine the occurrence and characteristics of an incident. Two AI paradigms are examined: 1) support vector machines (SVMs) and 2) artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each RSU then assesses the traffic condition based on the information from multiple vehicles traveling on its supervised highway segment. As a case study, this paper developed a model of the VII-SVM framework and evaluated its performance in a microscopic traffic simulation environment for a highway network in Spartanburg, SC. The performance of the VII-SVM was compared with the performance of the corresponding VII-ANN framework, and both frameworks were found to be capable of classifying the travel experience using the kinetic data generated by each vehicle. The performance of the VII-SVM framework, in terms of its detection rate, false-alarm rate, and detection times, was also found to be superior to a baseline California-type incident-detection algorithm. Moreover, the framework provided additional information, including an estimate of the incident location and the likely number of lanes blocked, which will be helpful for implementing an appropriate response strategy. The proposed VII-AI framework thus provides a reliable alternative to traditional traffic sensors in assessing traffic conditions.},

abstract = {The study and development of transportation systems have been a focus of attention in recent years, with many research efforts directed in particular at modelling traffic behaviour from both macroscopic and microscopic points of views. Although many statistical regression models of road traffic relationships have been formulated, they have proven to be unsuitable due to multiple and ill-defined traffic characteristics. Alternative methods such as neural networks have thus been sought but, despite some promising results, their design remains problematic and implementation is equally difficult. Another salient issue is that the opaqueness of trained networks prevents understanding the underlying models. Hybrid neuro-fuzzy rule-based systems, which combine the complementary capabilities of both neural networks and fuzzy logic, constitute a more promising technique for modelling traffic flow. This paper describes the application of a specific class of neuro-fuzzy system known as the Pseudo Outer-Product Fuzzy-Neural Network using Truth-Value-Restriction method (POPFNN-TVR) for modelling traffic behaviour. This approach has been shown to perform better on such problems than similar architectures. The results obtained highlight the capability of POPFNN-TVR in fuzzy knowledge extraction for modelling inter-lane relationships in a highway traffic stream, as well as in generalizing from sample data, as compared to traditional feed-forward neural networks using back-propagation learning. The model thus obtained automatically can be understood, analysed, and readily applied for transportation planning.},

abstract = {Confocal microscopy is widely used in neurobiology for studying the three-dimensional structure of the nervous system. Confocal image data are often multi-channel, with each channel resulting from a different fluorescent dye or fluorescent protein; one channel may have dense data, while another has sparse; and there are often structures at several spatial scales: subneuronal domains, neurons, and large groups of neurons (brain regions). Even qualitative analysis can therefore require visualization using techniques and parameters fine-tuned to a particular dataset. Despite the plethora of volume rendering techniques that have been available for many years, the techniques standardly used in neurobiological research are somewhat rudimentary, such as looking at image slices or maximal intensity projections. Thus there is a real demand from neurobiologists, and biologists in general, for a flexible visualization tool that allows interactive visualization of multi-channel confocal data, with rapid fine-tuning of parameters to reveal the three-dimensional relationships of structures of interest. Together with neurobiologists, we have designed such a tool, choosing visualization methods to suit the characteristics of confocal data and a typical biologist's workflow. We use interactive volume rendering with intuitive settings for multidimensional transfer functions, multiple render modes and multi-views for multi-channel volume data, and embedding of polygon data into volume data for rendering and editing. As an example, we apply this tool to visualize confocal microscopy datasets of the developing zebrafish visual system.},

abstract = {Image segmentation remains one of the major challenges in image analysis. Many segmentation algorithms have been developed for various applications. Unsatisfactory results have been encountered in some cases, for many existing segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we introduce three modified versions of the conventional moving k-means clustering algorithm called the fuzzy moving k-means, adaptive moving k-means and adaptive fuzzy moving k-means algorithms for image segmentation application. Based on analysis done using standard images (i.e. original bridge and noisy bridge) and hard evidence on microscopic digital image (i.e. segmentation of Sprague Dawley rat sperm), our final segmentation results compare favorably with the results obtained by the conventional k-means, fuzzy c-means and moving k-means algorithms. The qualitative and quantitative analysis done proved that the proposed algorithms are less sensitive with respect to noise. As such, the occurrence of dead centers, center redundancy and trapped center at local minima problems can be avoided. The proposed clustering algorithms are also less sensitive to initialization process of clustering value. The final center values obtained are located within their respective groups of data. This enabled the size and shape of the object in question to be maintained and preserved. Based on the simplicity and capabilities of the proposed algorithms, these algorithms are suitable to be implemented in consumer electronics products such as digital microscope, or digital camera as post processing tool for digital images.},

The morphology of the organic monolayers deposited on Si substrates was investigated by atomic force microscopy. The molecular coverage of ODM deposited on p-Si is poorer than that of TDA on n-Si substrate. The ideality factors of the p-Si/ODM and n-Si/TDA diodes were found to be 1.66 and 1.48, respectively. The electrical results show that the tridecylamine monolayer passivated junction has a lower ideality factor. The ideality factor indicates clear dependence on two different type functional groups R-SH (Thiol) and R-NH"2 (Amin) groups and it increases with different functional groups of organic molecule. The barrier height @f"b value of the n-Si/TDA diode is smaller than that of p-Si/ODM diode, as a result of chain length of the SAM organic molecules. The interface state density D"i"t values of the diodes were determined using conductance technique. The n-Si/TDA diode has the smaller interface state density according to p-Si/ODM diode. We have evaluated that the organic molecules control the electronic parameters of metal/semiconductor diodes and thus, organic modification helps to get one step closer towards to new organic assisted silicon based microelectronic devices.},

abstract = {Performing microstructure simulation of technical casting processes suffers from the strong interdependency between latent heat release due to local microstructure formation and heat diffusion on the macroscopic scale: local microstructure formation depends on the macroscopic heat fluxes and, in turn, the macroscopic temperature solution depends on the latent heat release, and therefore on the microstructure formation, in all parts of the casting. A self-consistent homoenthalpic approximation to this micro-macro problem is proposed, based on the assumption of a common enthalpy-temperature relation for the whole casting which is used for the description of latent heat production on the macroscale. This enthalpy-temperature relation is iteratively obtained by phase-field simulations on the microscale, thus taking into account the specific morphological impact on the latent heat production. This new approach is discussed and compared to other approximations for the coupling of the macroscopic heat flux to complex microstructure models. Simulations are performed for the binary alloy Al-3at%Cu, using a multiphase-field solidification model which is coupled to a thermodynamic database. Microstructure formation is simulated for several positions in a simple model plate casting, using a one-dimensional macroscopic temperature solver which can be directly coupled to the microscopic phase-field simulation tool.},

abstract = {Game traffic depends on two main factors, the game protocol and the gamers' behavior. Based on a few popular real-time multiplayer games this paper investigates the latter factor showing how a set of typical game phases--e.g., player movement, changes in the environment--impacts traffic on different observation levels. The nature of human behavior has such a high impact on traffic characteristics that it influences the traffic both at a macroscopic--e.g., traffic rate--and at a microscopic--payload content--level. First, by understanding the nature of this impact a user behavior detection algorithm is introduced to grab specific events and states from passive traffic measurements. The algorithms focus on the characteristics of the traffic rate, showing what information can be gathered by observing only packet header information. Second, as an application of our method some results, including a detailed analysis of measurements taken from an operational broadband network, are presented. Third, a novel model and an algorithm are introduced to extend the Deep Packet Inspection traffic classification method with the analysis of non-fix byte signatures, which are not considered in current methods. The model captures the variation of the dynamic byte segments and provides parameters for the algorithm. The introduced algorithm exploits the spatial and temporal correlation by examining and extracting the correlation structure of the traffic and constructing signatures based on the observed correlation. The algorithm is evaluated by examining proprietary gaming traffic and also other known non-gaming protocols.},

abstract = {As these As transistors are scaled to nanometer dimensions, the discreteness of the dopants becomes increasingly important. Transistors of 3 times 3 nm2 cross section contain, on average, approximately one dopant atom per nanometer of length, making any self-averaging impossible. The individual random dopants act as localized scatterers whose distribution, and therefore, impact on the electron transport, varies from device to device. This is complemented by electrostatic variation in the potential that controls the threshold voltage and the dominant current paths. The current density is greatly influenced by resonances associated with the attractive potential of the donors and screening effects. In this paper, for the first time, a full 3-D nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) simulation in the effective mass approximation has been used to study the influence of individual discrete donors in the source/drain on the I-V characteristics of a narrow n-channel Si nanowire transistor. We have compared devices with microscopically different configuration of dopants. The simulated variations in the I-V curves are analyzed with reference to the behavior of the transmission coefficients. We have highlighted the importance of resonance states when solving the NEGF and Poisson equations self-consistently.},

This paper proposes the utilization of a computer-aided diagnosis system based on a supervised classification algorithm from the artificial immune systems to assist the task of thyroid malignancy diagnosis. The core of the proposed algorithm is the so-called BoxCells, which are defined as parallelepipeds in the feature space. Properly defined operators act on the BoxCells in order to convert them into individual, elementary classifiers. The proposed algorithm is applied on FNA data from 2016 subjects with verified diagnosis and has exhibited average specificity higher than 99%, 90% sensitivity, and 98.5% accuracy. Furthermore, 24% of the cases that are characterized as "suspicious" by FNA and are histologically proven nonmalignancies have been classified correctly.},

abstract = {The emergence of new microscopy techniques in combination with the increasing resource of bioimaging data has given fresh impetus to utilizing image processing methods for studying biological processes. Cell tracking studies in particular, which are important for a wide range of biological processes such as embryonic development or the immune system, have recently become the focus of attention. These studies typically produce large volumes of data that are hard to investigate manually and therefore call for an automated approach. Due to the large variety of biological cells and the inhomogeneity of applications, however, there exists no widely accepted method or system for cell tracking until today. In this article, we present our publicly available DYNAMIK software environment that allows users to compute a suit of cell features and plot the trajectory of multiple cells over a sequence of frames. Using chemotaxis and Ras pathways as an example, we show how users can employ our software to compute statistics about cell motility and other cell information, and how to evaluate their test series based on the data computed. We see that DYNAMIK's segmentation and tracking compares favorably with the output produced by other software packages.

We developed two macroscopic models by taking two different perspectives: A Stock &amp; Flow model, which is simple to implement and fast to simulate, and a spatially resolved model based on diffusion processes. These two models were compared concerning their prediction quality and their analytical power: One model allowed easy identification of the major feedback loops governing the swarm behavior. The other model allowed analysis of the expected shapes and positions of observable robot clusters. We found a high correlation in the challenges posed by both modeling techniques and we highlighted the inherent problems of inferring emergent macroscopic rules from a microscopic description of swarm behavior.},

abstract = {To obtain development information of individual plant cells, it is necessary to perform in vivo imaging of the specimen under study, through time-lapse confocal microscopy. Automation of cell detection/marking process is important to provide research tools in order to ease the search for special events, such as cell division. In this paper we discuss an automatic cell detection approach for Arabidopsis thaliana based on segmentation, which selects the best cell candidates from a starting watershed-based image segmentation and improves the result by merging adjacent regions. The selection of individual cells is obtained using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, based on a cell descriptor constructed from the shape and edge strength of the cells' contour. In addition we proposed a novel cell merging criterion based on edge strength along the line that connects adjacent cells' centroids, which is a valuable tool in the reduction of cell over-segmentation. The result is largely pruned of badly segmented and over-segmented cells, thus facilitating the study of cells. When comparing the results after merging with the basic watershed segmentation, we obtain 1.5% better coverage (increase in F-measure) and up to 27% better precision in correct cell segmentation.},

abstract = {We prove for generic steady solutions of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) models that the variation of the numerical errors is set by specific combinations (called ''magic numbers'') of the relaxation rates associated with the symmetric and anti-symmetric collision moments. Given the governing dimensionless physical parameters, such as the Reynolds or Peclet numbers, and the geometry of the computational mesh, the numerical errors remain the same for any change of the transport coefficients only when the ''free'' (''kinetic'') anti-symmetric rates and the boundary rules are chosen properly. The single-relaxation-time (BGK) model has no free collision rate and yields viscosity dependent errors with any boundary scheme for hydrodynamic problems. The simplest and most efficient collision operator for invariant errors is the two-relaxation-times (TRT) model. As an example, this model is able to compute viscosity independent permeabilities for any porous structure. These properties are derived from steady recurrence equations, obtained through linear combinations of the LB evolution equations, in which the equilibrium and non-equilibrium components are directly interconnected via finite-difference link-wise central operators. The explicit dependency of the non-equilibrium solution on the relaxation rates is then obtained. This allows us, first, to confirm the governing role of the ''magic'' combinations for steady solutions of the Stokes equation, second, to extend this property to steady solutions of the Navier-Stokes and anisotropic advection-diffusion equations, third, to develop a parametrization analysis of the microscopic and macroscopic closure relations prescribed via link-wise boundary schemes.},

abstract = {A numerical scheme is presented for accurate simulation of fluid flow using the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) on unstructured mesh. A finite volume approach is adopted to discretize the LBE on a cell-centered, arbitrary shaped, triangular tessellation. The formulation includes a formal, second order discretization using a Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) scheme for the terms representing advection of the distribution function in physical space, due to microscopic particle motion. The advantage of the LBE approach is exploited by implementing the scheme in a new computer code to run on a parallel computing system. Performance of the new formulation is systematically investigated by simulating four benchmark flows of increasing complexity, namely (1) flow in a plane channel, (2) unsteady Couette flow, (3) flow caused by a moving lid over a 2D square cavity and (4) flow over a circular cylinder. For each of these flows, the present scheme is validated with the results from Navier-Stokes computations as well as lattice Boltzmann simulations on regular mesh. It is shown that the scheme is robust and accurate for the different test problems studied.},

This analysis provides a way of linking two features of particular interest in software systems: first the microscopic distribution of defects within components and second the macroscopic distribution of component sizes in a typical system. The former has been studied extensively, but the latter much less so. This paper shows that subject to an external constraint that the total number of defects is fixed in an equilibrium system, commonly used defect models for individual components directly imply that the distribution of component sizes in such a system will obey a power-law Pareto distribution. The paper continues by analyzing a large number of mature systems of different total sizes, different implementation languages, and very different application areas, and demonstrates that the component sizes do indeed appear to obey the predicted power-law distribution. Some possible implications of this are explored.},

Polymers such as CPE are water-soluble multicomponent molecules that combine semiconductor and light harvesting properties and they have been successfully used for fluorescence sensing. We have developed a software tool capable of reconstructing topological images in sequential fashion to provide precise statistical data about the aggregations and composition of deposited material. Atomic force microscopy has been used to analyze various processes of polymer-DNA formation. In this paper, we present a new approach to image analysis and processing of atomic force microscopy (AFM) data.

abstract = {Karyotype analysis is a widespread procedure in cytogenetics to assess the possible presence of genetics defects. The procedure is lengthy and repetitive, so that an automatic analysis would greatly help the cytogeneticist routine work. Still, automatic segmentation and full disentangling of chromosomes are open issues. We propose an automatic procedure to obtain the separated chromosomes, which are then ready for a subsequent classification step. The segmentation is carried out by means of a space-variant thresholding scheme, which proved to be successful even in presence of hyper- or hypofluorescent regions in the image. Then, the tree of choices to resolve touching and overlapping chromosomes is recursively explored, choosing the best combination of cuts and overlaps based on geometric evidence and image information. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method on routine data acquired with different microscope-camera setup at different laboratories: from 162 images of 117 cells totaling 6683 chromosomes, 94% of the chromosomes were correctly segmented, solving 90% of the overlaps and 90% of the touchings.

abstract = {This paper presents a distributed-parameters-based modeling framework for piezoresistive microcantilever (MC)-based force sensors used in a variety of cantilever-based nanomanipulation processes. Current modeling practices call for a simple lumped-parameters approach rather than modeling the piezoresistive MC itself. Owing to the widespread applications of such MCs in nanoscale force sensing or non-contact atomic force microscopy with nano-Newton to pico-Newton force measurement requirements, precise modeling of the piezoresistive MCs is essential. Instead of the previously used lumped-parameters modeling, a distributed-parameters modeling framework is proposed and developed here to arrive at the most complete model of the piezoresistive MC including tip-mass, tip-force and base movement considerations. In order to have online control and real-time sensor feedback, a closed-form model of the piezoresistive MC, which expresses the MC's piezoresistive output voltage as a function of tip force and base motion, is highly desirable. Along this line of reasoning, a closed-form model for the piezoresistive MC is presented. Following mathematical modeling, both numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed distributed-parameters model when compared with the previously reported lumped-parameters modeling approach. Utilizing the developed model, a modified robust controller with perturbation estimation is adopted to target the problem of slow imaging acquisition and manipulation at the nanoscale. It is shown that the proposed controller can stabilize such nanomanipulation process in less than a second. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the stability and performance characteristics of the designed controller. Such modeling and control development could pave the way for MC-based nanomanipulation and nanopositioning.},

abstract = {Bright field imaging of biological samples stained with antibodies and/or special stains provides a rapid protocol for visualizing various macromolecules. However, this method of sample staining and imaging is rarely employed for direct quantitative analysis due to variations in sample fixations, ambiguities introduced by color composition and the limited dynamic range of imaging instruments. We demonstrate that, through the decomposition of color signals, staining can be scored on a cell-by-cell basis. We have applied our method to fibroblasts grown from histologically normal breast tissue biopsies obtained from two distinct populations. Initially, nuclear regions are segmented through conversion of color images into gray scale, and detection of dark elliptic features. Subsequently, the strength of staining is quantified by a color decomposition model that is optimized by a graph cut algorithm. In rare cases where nuclear signal is significantly altered as a result of sample preparation, nuclear segmentation can be validated and corrected. Finally, segmented stained patterns are associated with each nuclear region following region-based tessellation. Compared to classical non-negative matrix factorization, proposed method: (i) improves color decomposition, (ii) has a better noise immunity, (iii) is more invariant to initial conditions and (iv) has a superior computing performance. contact: hchang@lbl.gov},

The measurement results of the field emission properties of ZnO nanostructures showed that different morphologies of ZnO nanostructures had a significant effect on their field emission properties; ZnO nanowires exhibited the best electron field emission ability among the three kinds of nanostructures, and this was attributed to a high field-enhancement factor and dense emission sites.},

For this purpose, circular shaped structures were realized, and the influence of the implanted Ga dose (ranging from 10^1^5 to 10^1^7cm^-^2) and of the patterned area dimension (diameters ranging from 1 to 4@mm) on the damage were examined. It is shown that the extension of the lateral damage around FIB milled structures is much larger than the area of the purposely irradiated regions (up to a factor of 5) and increases with both, Ga dose and pattern diameter. Besides, the unique capability of SCM and SSRM techniques for the detection of FIB induced damage is demonstrated. In particular, it is shown that their high sensitivity to low densities of defects allows detecting larger damaged areas compared to Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) topography maps.},

The micro-machined, piezoresistive, tactile sensor array has been successfully fabricated by the use of a polymer MEMS process.

abstract = {In nanoimprint lithography (NIL), a mold is coated with an antisticking layer for preventing resin from adhering to it. A fluorinated self-assembled monolayer (F-SAM) is mainly used as the antisticking layer. The temperature of the mold in thermal NIL increases around the glass transition temperature of the resin. It is therefore important to assess the durability of the antisticking layer against heat. We evaluated the releasing effect of F-SAMs with and without annealing by using measurements obtained from the surface free energy and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Furthermore, we examined the surface chemical composition and the surface morphology of F-SAMs with and without annealing using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). From these results, we confirmed that the releasing effect of F-SAM deteriorated due to thermal decomposition when annealing over 500^oC. However, we found that F-SAMs annealed at 500^oC had a sufficiently large releasing effect in nanoimprinting.},

An atomic force microscopy (AFM), a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are utilized to confirm the formation height and the surface topography of the transferred patterns after the imprinting process. The formation height ratio is utilized as an index for analyzing the quality of formation. The experimental results illustrate that those factors obviously effect the formation.

However, the scale of this problem presents a challenge for automatic registration methods. In this paper we present a novel method for efficient automatic registration using graphics processing units (GPUs) and parallel programming. Comparing a C++ CPU implementation with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) libraries and pthreads running on GPU we achieve a speed-up factor of up to 4.11 with a single GPU and 6.68 with a GPU pair. We present execution times for a benchmark composed of two sets of large-scale images: mouse placenta (16  K  16  K  pixels) and breast cancer tumors (23  K  62  K  pixels). It takes more than 12 hours for the genetic case in C++ to register a typical sample composed of 500 consecutive slides, which was reduced to less than 2 hours using two GPUs, in addition to a very promising scalability for extending those gains easily on a large number of GPUs in a distributed system.},

From the results obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), drug loaded copolymer nanoparticles were found to exhibit a spherical shape and their mean diameter appeared in the range of 180-200 nm. Fourier Transformation-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra indicated that no chemical interaction between the drug and the matrix could be justified, while Wide-Angle X-Ray Diffraction (WAXD) patterns proved a low degree of crystallinity of Nimodipine in the nanoparticles.

abstract = {In the context of virtualized-reality-based telemicromanipulation, this paper presents a visual calibration technique for an optical microscope coupled to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The accuracy and flexibility of the proposed automatic virtual calibration method, based on parallel single-plane properties, are outlined. In contrast to standard approaches, a 3-D virtual calibration pattern is constructed using the micromanipulator tip with subpixel-order localization in the image frame. The proposed procedure leads to a linear system whose solution provides directly both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the geometrical model. Computer simulations and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and promising results have been obtained. Based on the proposed calibration techniques, a 3-D virtual microenvironment of the workspace is reconstructed through the real-time imaging of two perpendicular optical microscopes. Our method provides a flexible, easy-to-use technical alternative to the classical techniques used in micromanipulation systems.},

abstract = {The two main topics with respect to better gallium nitride (GaN)-based optoelectronic device performance are the improvement of crystal quality and of light extraction. Concerning the first topic, the epitaxial growth of GaN-related materials has to be improved. Since native substrates with good quality are still expensive, foreign substrates like sapphire or silicon which are much cheaper are used, but they introduce a lattice as well as a thermal mismatch leading to detrimental crystal defects. Several approaches to reduce the defect density exist, but in most cases they are coupled with a much higher technological effort. We present an alternative solution to decrease the defect density by the growth of GaN nanostructures, where the small footprint and high aspect ratio leads to a much lower influence of the substrate. Metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy of GaN nanostructures and InGaN/GaN multi-quantum wells was carried out in a vertical reactor with close-coupled showerhead. Studies on the morphologic properties have been carried out by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to reveal the influence of growth parameters and material composition. Cathodoluminescence measurements show the good optical properties of the GaN as well as of the InGaN/GaN structures.},

abstract = {Flow through porous media is ubiquitous, occurring from large geological scales down to the microscopic scales. Several critical engineering phenomena like contaminant spread, nuclear waste disposal and oil recovery rely on accurate analysis and prediction of these multiscale phenomena. Such analysis is complicated by inherent uncertainties as well as the limited information available to characterize the system. Any realistic modeling of these transport phenomena has to resolve two key issues: (i) the multi-length scale variations in permeability that these systems exhibit, and (ii) the inherently limited information available to quantify these property variations that necessitates posing these phenomena as stochastic processes. A stochastic variational multiscale formulation is developed to incorporate uncertain multiscale features. A stochastic analogue to a mixed multiscale finite element framework is used to formulate the physical stochastic multiscale process. Recent developments in linear and non-linear model reduction techniques are used to convert the limited information available about the permeability variation into a viable stochastic input model. An adaptive sparse grid collocation strategy is used to efficiently solve the resulting stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). The framework is applied to analyze flow through random heterogeneous media when only limited statistics about the permeability variation are given.},

The syntheses were based on the decomposition of aqueous KMnO4 in presence of HCl for birnessite-type and acidified MnSO4 for cryptomelane-type manganese dioxide under soft hydrothermal conditions. They were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. XRD patterns show the formation of birnessite for the first synthesis and a mixture of cryptomelane and birnessite-types MnO2 for the second synthesis. XRD data revealed that the Hoffmeister anions have a significant effect on the nanostructures of birnessite. The sulphate ion-treated birnessite has the smallest crystals, whereas the chloride ion-treated birnessite has the largest crystals. Their TEM and HRTEM studies revealed a transformation from nanoplatelet morphology for chloride-treated samples to nanofibrous morphology for sulphate-treated birnessite. For the cryptomelane nanostructures, Hoffmeister anions also show a profound effect on their crystalline structures as determined by XRD analyses revealing a transformation of the cryptomelane phase to birnessite phase of MnO2. This transformation is also supported by TEM and HRTEM studies.},

abstract = {The present paper addresses the following question: can a simple regulatory bone remodeling model predict effects of unloading conditions on the trabecular bone morphology? In an attempt to answer this question, rat tail-suspension was chosen as a model that mimics the microgravity environment. Over 23 days, histomorphometric analysis was carried out on cross-sections of tibias of the suspended animals. The slices were digitalized and images discretized to obtain osteocyte distribution and apparent bone density. Based on these experimental data, finite element simulations were conducted to evaluate the bone loss and the change in trabecular architecture similar to those observed after a spaceflight. The numerical model is driven by a remodeling law that takes into account the nonuniform osteocyte distribution that may itself provide mechanoreception. We used the bone density rate of change from the remodeling theory and a time stepping algorithm witch are implemented in a finite element software. This approach takes into account the unloading effects on bone remodeling process and permits to confront experimental and numerical data. We showed that there is a good agreement between these data, particularly at the beginning of the simulated bone mass loss during the rat tail-suspension experiment. Indeed, we obtained a variation of 5.25% at day 7 (D7), 2.09% at day 13 (D13) and finally, 51.03% at day 23 (D23). Despite that last variation, the proposed theoretical model can be suitable to simulate the alteration of bone mineral density under the specific unloading conditions of the rat tail-suspension model.},

abstract = {Scanning acoustic microscopy is an imaging method in which the focused high frequency ultrasound is used to visualize the micro structures. The morphology and acoustic properties of the biological tissues can be evaluated using scanning acoustic microscope system. To determine thin tissues having micrometer thickness, the high acoustic frequency is required for conventional SAM. In practice the acoustic frequency is restricted by the penetration depth through the material. Characterization of thin sliced tissue is difficult, as the reflected signals from top and bottom are superimposed. In order to improve the axial resolution of conventional SAM, a technique based on sparse signal representation in overcomplete time---frequency dictionaries is investigated and among the great number of algorithms for finding sparse representation, we first apply matching pursuit (MP) and basis pursuit (BP) and then propose the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit (StOMP) algorithms to decompose the A-scan signal to an overcomplete Gabor dictionary. Different criteria are used for measuring the performance of these algorithms in C-scan imaging. The proposed method can separate closely space overlapping echoes beyond the resolution of conventional SAM systems and also the final results show that StOMP performs best overall in extracting the specific echo, since this algorithm is precise and fast.},

abstract = {Successful segmentation of a multilevel to a bilevel microscopic cell image rather frequently gives rise to touching objects which need to be separated in order to perform object specific measurements. The standard approach of dealing with this problem is a watershed decomposition of gradient, distance or low pass filtered transforms. However, if cell clustering is excessive, the cell size varies and cells have various shapes that are different from circles the watershed approaches produce unsatisfying results.We found a technique that splits cell clumps into meaningful parts. Since this method is based on the analysis of contour curvature on the scale space of Fourier coefficients relevant dominant points can be recognized. Based on an optimized heuristic approach pairs of these dominant points are recursively matched since splitted objects do not possess concavities respectively intrusions anymore. The advantages of this approach are (i) the independence of cell shapes which are clumped, (ii) the consideration of holes or background intensities within objects, (iii) the robustness in terms of convergence and a few parameters only to adapt to other families of decomposition problems.The objective of this contribution is to explain the algorithm, show its results using different examples from benchmark databases, self generated images and complex configurations of cell images.},

abstract = {The properties of the MgZnO nanocrystalline thin films deposited on c-Al"2O"3 substrates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at various oxygen partial pressures (Po"2) were thoroughly studied. It was found that the nanocrystalline films grown in the oxygen partial pressure range from 38 to 56Pa were all c-axis oriented. From the atomic force microscope (AFM) images and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, we could also find that both the surface morphologies and the optical properties of the MgZnO nanocrystalline thin films depended on the oxygen partial pressure greatly. Hall effect measurements confirmed the conversion of conduction type of MgZnO under a certain range of oxygen partial pressure. With the increase of oxygen content, the crystallinity of MgZnO nanocrystalline thin films was degraded to polycrystalline and the p-type MgZnO was produced when the oxygen partial pressure was larger than 50Pa. The hole concentration and mobility could reach to 9.71x10^1^7cm^-^3 and 2.44cm^2V^-^1s^-^1, and the resistivity was 2.87@Wcm while the oxygen partial pressure was 56Pa.},

The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ZnO(002) and (102) @w-scan rocking curves are 119 and 202arcsec, corresponding a high crystal quality. The status of the strain in ZnO thick film was particularly analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) @w-2@q scanning. The results show that the strain in ZnO film is compressive, which is also supported by Raman scattering spectroscopy.

The specific application is a study of the morphological change in a mouse placenta induced by knocking out the retinoblastoma gene. Result: This workflow includes four major components: (i) serial section image acquisition, (ii) image preprocessing, (iii) image analysis involving 2D pair-wise registration, 2D segmentation and 3D reconstruction, and (iv) visualization and quantification of phenotyping parameters. Several new algorithms have been developed within each workflow component. The results confirm the hypotheses that (i) the volume of labyrinth tissue decreases in mutant mice with the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene knockout and (ii) there is more interdigitation at the surface between the labyrinth and spongiotrophoblast tissues in mutant placenta. Additional confidence stem from agreement in the 3D visualization and the quantitative results generated. Availability: The source code is available upon request.},

abstract = {The cerebellum and basal ganglia are reciprocally connected with the cerebral cortex, forming many loops that function as distributed processing modules. Here we present a detailed model of one microscopic loop between the motor cortex and the cerebellum, and we show how small arrays of these microscopic loops (CB modules) can be used to generate biologically plausible motor commands for controlling movement. A fundamental feature of CB modules is the presence of positive feedback loops between the cerebellar nucleus and the motor cortex. We use nonlinear dynamics to model one microscopic loop and to investigate its bistable properties. Simulations demonstrate an ability to program a motor command well in advance of command generation and an ability to vary command duration. However, control of command intensity is minimal, which could interfere with the control of movement velocity. To assess these hypotheses, we use a minimal nonlinear model of the neuromuscular (NM) system that translates motor commands into actual movements. Simulations of the combined CB-NM modular model indicate that movement duration is readily controlled, whereas velocity is poorly controlled. We then explore how an array of eight CB-NM modules can be used to control the direction and endpoint of a planar movement. In actuality, thousands of such microscopic loops function together as an array of adjustable pattern generators for programming and regulating the composite motor commands that control limb movements. We discuss the biological plausibility and limitations of the model. We also discuss ways in which an agent-based representation can take advantage of the modularity in order to model this complex system. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Shape and size of these nanomaterials were observed by transmission electron microscope and atomic force microscope. The particles are of rod shapes having diameters from 50 to 80 nm and lengths varying within the range 0.4-0.7 mum. Pellets of these nanorods were irradiated by 48 MeV7Li3+ ions at different fluences in the range 1times1011-1times1014 ions/cm2 (with corresponding doses in the range 0.679-679 kGy) and their thermoluminescence (TL) properties have been studied. The TL glow curves are observed to have prominent peaks at around 588 K along with smaller one at around 410 K. The TL intensity of the former is found to increase with increasing the fluence, while that of the latter decreases. These behaviors are in contrast with those of the peaks induced by 137Cs gamma-rays. This modification in case of irradiation by ion beam has been attributed to the change in population of the luminescent/trapping centers due to the use of highly energetic ions. From these results, it is suggested that the nanorods of LiF:Mg,Cu,P might be used as detectors for mixed fields radiations such as space radiations.},

abstract = {In low resolution structures of biological assemblies one can often observe conformational deviations that require a flexible rearrangement of structural domains fitted at the atomic level. We are evaluating interpolation methods for the flexible alignment of atomic models based on coarse models. Spatial interpolation is well established in image-processing and visualization to describe the overall deformation or warping of an object or an image. Combined with a coarse representation of the biological system by feature vectors, such methods can provide a flexible approximation of the molecular structure. We have compared three well-known interpolation techniques and evaluated the results by comparing them with constrained molecular dynamics. One method, inverse distance weighting interpolation, consistently produced models that were nearly indistinguishable on the alpha carbon level from the molecular dynamics results. The method is simple to apply and enables flexing of structures by non-expert modelers. This is useful for the basic interpretation of volumetric data in biological applications such as electron microscopy. The method can be used as a general interpretation tool for sparsely sampled motions derived from coarse models.

Also, the thermal diffusivity of green coffee samples was measured by open cell PA technique, in order to study the relation of this parameter with the bean cellular structure, which was looked through an optical microscopy.

abstract = {Radio frequency magnetron sputtered Ba"0"."6"5Sr"0"."3"5TiO"3 (BST) thin films were etched in CF"4/Ar/O"2 plasma by magnetically enhanced reactive ion etching technique. The etching characteristics of BST films were characterized in terms of microstructure and electrical properties. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction results indicate that the microstructure of the etched BST film is degraded because of the rugged surface and lowered intensities of BST (100), (110), (111) and (200) peaks compared to the unetched counterparts. Dielectric constant and dielectric dissipation of the unetched, etched and postannealed-after-etched BST film capacitors are 419, 346, 371, 0.018, 0.039 and 0.031 at 100kHz, respectively. The corresponding dielectric tunability, figure of merit and remnant polarization are 19.57%, 11.56%, 17.25%, 10.87, 2.96, 5.56, 3.62@mC/cm^2, 2.32 and 2.81@mC/cm^2 at 25V, respectively. The leakage current density of 1.75x10^-^4 A/cm^2 at 15V for the etched BST capacitor is over two orders of magnitude higher than 1.28x10^-^6 A/cm^2 for the unetched capacitor, while leakage current density of the postannealed-after-etched capacitor decreases slightly. It means that the electrical properties of the etched BST film are deteriorated due to the CF"4/Ar/O"2 plasma-induced damage. Furthermore, the damage is alleviated, and the degraded microstructure and electrical properties are partially recovered after the etched BST film is postannealed at 923K for 20min under a flowing O"2 ambience.},

abstract = {Our interest is the integration of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in electronic devices (IC, NEMS). In the scope of this work, we present a study on the preparation of the catalyst Ni particles from ultrathin films and the synthesis of carbon nanotubes by the chemical vapour deposition method. For the preparation, we use a cold-wall CVD reactor especially designed for handling samples up to a size of a 4'' wafer. We show the influence of different process conditions like temperature, initial layer thickness of catalyst and substrate on particle formation characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We show that the optimization of process conditions in the catalyst preparation phase is constitutive for dense CNT films. Regarding the application of CNTs as electrical interconnects, we studied the arrangement of nanoparticles on Al and TiN supporting layer. Furthermore, we fabricated the first test structures for the selective growth of CNTs out of contact holes on a Cu/TiN metallization layer system. The growth of multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) was performed with thermal CVD with ethylene as a precursor gas and hydrogen as supporting gas mixed in a nitrogen gas flow. The effects of growth condition on the quality and morphology of the CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The influence of temperature, gas composition and substrate on CNT growth will be presented. We managed to grow dense CNTs even at temperatures as low as 500^oC.},

The Fluorospot assay adapted this analysis to two products per cell, and this has now been extended to three-color measurement of both mouse and human cytokine-secreting cells. Due to the increased data complexity, and particularly the need to define single-, double- and triple-producing cells, it is critical to objectively quantify spot number, size, intensity, and coincidence with other spots. An automated counting program, Exploraspot, was therefore developed to detect and quantify Fluorospots in automated fluorescence microscope images. Morphological parameters, including size, intensity, location, circularity and others are calculated for each spot, exported in FCS format, and further analyzed by gating and graphical display in popular flow cytometry analysis programs. The utility of Exploraspot is demonstrated by identification of single-, double- and triple-secreting T cells; tolerance of variable background fluorescence; and estimation of the numbers of genuine versus random multiple events.},

The effects of various parameters such as ultrasonic frequency, feed concentration, sonication time, surfactant, and applied ultrasonic power on sonofragmentation were investigated. Sub-100 nm particle production by sonofragmentation was validated via three metrics, i.e., laser particle size analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and turbidimetry. There is a significant change in color and shape of alumina ceramic particles as a result of sonofragmentation. Higher size reduction ratios are obtained at lower frequencies and at higher input power. Submicrometer particle generation increases as concentration of the feed particles increases, indicating that attrition by interparticle collision is a significant mechanism. The shape of the particles changes from angular to spherical as sonofragmentation time increases. Probe-type sonication produces fragmentation effects that are less uniform than those induced by tank-type ultrasonics. Surfactant plays a significant role in preventing agglomeration, especially as finer fragments are produced with prolonged sonication.},

abstract = {Many diseases are a result of, or are associated with, abnormal blood flow. Usually, these abnormalities are caused by unhealthy red blood cells with modified shape which have difficulty traversing the microvessels. Unfortunately, experimental approaches to these problems are limited due to difficulties in isolating the critical determinants of flow in vivo or in vitro. Computer models overcome these problems, but most strive only to reproduce the macroscopic, continuum aspect of blood flow by making many simplifying assumptions. Unfortunately, these models cannot address the relationship between microscopic, cellular flow dynamics and macroscopic, bulk blood rheology. Here, we demonstrate the wide applicability of a novel, computational model for simulating blood flow that includes each blood cell explicitly. This fully 3D model accounts for cell membrane dynamics and reproduces rest shapes accurately. This model allows us to: (i) extract empirical relationships for use in macroscopic models and (ii) simulate various disease states to identify potential targets for therapy. We show here that the model accurately reproduces the well-documented flow relationships for healthy blood, and also predicts the abnormalities in blood rheology exhibited by malaria and sickle cell patients.},

Experimental results indicated that the chamber idleness at 270^oC resulted in significant Al"2Cu precipitation and hillock growth for the Al-Cu films, which enhanced the occurrence rate of the microcorrosion-induced bridging defects and caused yield degradation on production line while post-deposition annealing at 400^oC for 30min was proven to effectively regain good yield for the chamber-idled wafers. The yield recovery could be attributed to the fast Al"2Cu dissolution and hillock mitigation at the annealing temperature. The electrical sheet resistance of the Al-Cu films would somewhat increase due to the formation of the Al"3Ti phase during annealing, but the Al"2Cu precipitates and surface hillocks formed during chamber idleness would scarcely change the electrical property of the films. This study suggests that the evolutions of second phase and surface hillocks can be controlled by the processing duration and post-deposition treatment rather than the deposition temperature or Cu addition amount of Al-Cu alloy.},

abstract = {This work contributes to the development of microscopic traffic performance models in the airport. It enhances the existing models and develops new ones. An important contribution of this research is the empirical work, i.e. estimating models using statistically rigorous methods and microscopic data collected from real traffic. With the ever increasing congestion at airports around the world, studies into ways of maximizing infrastructures capacity and minimizing delay costs while meeting the goals of the airlines are necessary. The methodology applied for the calculation of runway capacity start from the traffic data elaboration of the Naples International Airport: we have been determined this aim from the airline pattern in the above airport. The hourly capacity is calculated as the inverse of the headway of consecutive aircraft operation; this is drawn with an average of the time headway in the "critical periods". The determination of the "capacity periods" it happens in three phases: in the first one we are drawn by the sample the stationary periods; in the second we are considered, of these, only those with the lowest averages time headway, these are called "critical" periods; subsequently we are examined only that (critical periods) had time length less than the 60 minutes and that have an average of time headway that it is almost attested around to a constant value. The stationary periods, as it says the same definition, are characterized by the relatives constant time headway, in other words there aren't meaningful phenomenon of increase or diminution of the traffic flow. The critical periods are static periods that are found on the traffic flow curve defined "critic", this curve we have obtained to envelop some values that mark the lower limit of the diagram defined time length vs. averages of the static periods. Defined the critical periods we have been determined the experimental headway curves and we compared with those theoretical. Of such experimental curves we have been considered the characteristics values: the average and the standard deviation. In this way we have determined a matrix of the average time headway both for operations flight that for type of airplane. The following step has been that to define and to implement the analytical model. We suggest a mathematic algorithm that is able to optimize, a posteriori, the flight operation under the delay restraint. The algorithm determines the best sequence of aircrafts that minimizes the delays and it maximizes the runway capacity. The proposed methodology, even if determine an evident improvement of the runway capacity, in the respect of thresholds of acceptable average delays (constrain), represents an initial methodological phase that will desirably conclude in the determination of a "dynamic" model, that is able to assist the inspectors' job in way real-time, assigning, opportunely, an excellent sequence of the successions of flight operations.},

abstract = {Under mechanical load, the reaction of polymers with a low molecular weight features small time constants. To test their actual behaviour in a thermal imprint, two polystyrenes (PS 10kg/mol, PS 30kg/mol) were imprinted under partial cavity filling conditions. The imprints were inspected regarding recovery and physical self-assembly of the polymer by means of an optical microscope. The results show that such low molecular weight polymers obviously are not suited for thermal imprint. In contrast to polymers with higher molecular weight, physical self-assembly and recovery occur at an identical imprint temperature, so that processing conditions for defect-free imprint cannot be identified. In case of a polymer with higher molecular weight this is possible by adequate choice of the processing temperature.},

The lenses are made from single crystal silicon membranes, which have uniform thermal conductivity and homogeneous thermal expansion. Silicon Fresnel zone plates with an outermost zone width down to 30nm were produced by means of electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching. They were tested in conventional synchrotron light sources in a full-field transmission X-ray microscope and in a scanning transmission X-ray microscope. Features below 35nm were resolved. High resolution in combination with ability to withstand high heat load radiation make them a potential candidate for the new generation of X-ray sources based on the free electron laser principle.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet light irradiation of PS microbeads can be used for controlling the solvent uptake and release upon exposure to its vapor. The irradiation leads to additional fracture and crosslinking of PS chains thus reducing the amount of solvent uptake significantly. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that this effect is pronounced in a shell of the PS microbeads having a thickness in the range of 1-2µm. In addition, this shell shows considerable fluorescence when excited between 300nm and 500nm that is attributed to lower molecular weight fragments of PS. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies of small tracers diffusion in a microbead core have revealed that the swelling of the core is not altered by the UV exposure, and the UV crosslinking effects are limited to the shell only. Chemically and UV cross-linked PS beads keep their shapes even after numerous swelling cycles in saturated toluene vapors.},

Self-alignment is essential to minimize the contribution to the parasitic series source/drain resistance (RSD) from the access region between the ohmic contact and the gate, whilst retaining the overall electrostatic integrity of the device. In this work, a blanket Si3N4 was deposited by room temperature inductively coupled plasma chemical vapour deposition (ICP-CVD) and etched by reactive ion etching in a SF6/N2 based chemistry. Conditions were optimised to ensure low damage to the underlying device layer stack. This process has successfully produced thin Si3N4 spacers for fabricating self-aligned GaAs MOSFETs. The sheet resistance of III-V MOSFET materials was monitored as a function of etch parameters to assess the impact of damage related effects on the electronic characteristics of the underlying material. The etching profile and the sheet resistance of the device layer structures were characterised by using scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and sonogage, respectively.},

abstract = {The rupture of thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) plaques is a major cause of acute coronary events. A TCFA has a trombogenic soft lipid core, shielded from the blood stream by a thin, possibly inflamed, stiff cap. The majority of atherosclerotic plaques resemble a TCFA in terms of overall structural composition, but have a more complex, heterogeneous morphology. An assessment of the material distribution is vital for quantifying the plaque's mechanical stability and for determining the effect of plaque-stabilizing pharmaceutical agents. We describe a new automated inverse elasticity method, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) modulography, which is capable of reconstructing a heterogeneous Young's modulus distribution. The elastogram (i.e., spatial strain distribution) of the plaque is the input for the method, and is measured using the clinically available technique, IVUS elastography. Our method incorporates a novel divide-and-conquer strategy, allowing the reconstruction of TCFAs as well as heterogeneous plaques with localized regions of soft, weakened tissue. The method was applied to ex vivo elastograms, which were simulated from the cross sections of postmortem human coronary plaques. To demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the method, measured elastograms from human atherosclerotic coronary arteries were analyzed. One elastogram was measured in vitro; the other, in vivo . The method approximated the true Young's modulus distribution of all simulated plaques, while the in vitro reconstruction was in agreement with histology. In conclusion, the IVUS modulography in combination with the IVUS elastography has strong potential to become an all-encompassing modality for detecting plaques, for assessing the information related to their rupture-proneness, and for imaging their heterogeneous elastic material composition.},

abstract = {In this paper we present some enrichment techniques for the modeling of heterogeneous media in the presence of singularities such as cracks which overcome long-standing problems associated with the assumption of local periodicity in traditional asymptotic homogenization methods. An octree partition of unity method (OctPUM) is developed to solve the macroscopic problem. In this technique the geometry is discretized using hierarchical data structures known as quadtrees and octrees in two- and three-dimensions, respectively and the approximation functions, generated using the partition of unity approach, are compactly supported on n-dimensional cubes. OctPUM is in-between finite elements and meshfree methods in character and is computationally more efficient than pure meshfree techniques. Solutions near crack tips may be obtained without excessive local refinements using localized enrichment functions. In order to compute the microscopic fields near the crack edge within the macroscale computations, a structural enrichment-based homogenization method is introduced in which the approximation space of the OctPUM at the macroscopic scale is enriched by functions generated at the microscopic scale using the asymptotic homogenization technique. Several example problems in one- and two-dimensional analysis, including one involving realistic microstructures, are solved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the enrichment strategies.},

We apply learning vector quantization (LVQ) to the feature vectors obtained for 320 heads that were labelled as intact or damaged using stains. A LVQ system with four prototypes (two for each class) allows us to classify cells with an overall test error of 6.8%.

First the bath stability and deposit characteristics were studied. Fabrication of micro specimens were then carried out on silicon substrates covered with novolac as well as thick PMMA resist for LIGA. Effects of different parameters like current density, nickel ion and tungsten ion concentration in the bath, deposition time etc. on the deposit characteristics and current efficiency were studied. The deposited Ni---W samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy depressive X-ray spectroscopy, light optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Results show that during a few tens of hours of deposition, ammonia loss from the covered bath used is minimal and the bath remains stable. Selection of proper bath and deposition parameters allows a window for the deposition of crack free, thick, nano crystalline nickel---tungsten alloys. Using the optimum parameters, it has been possible to fabricate Ni-12 at% W micro tensile specimens with a nominal thickness of 120 μm by the LIGA process.},

Thus, even though there have been many workflow modeling and management methods, they have limitations to deal with the special characteristics of PDP. We define PWF-nets based on timed colored Petri nets for the workflow management of PDP and propose a method of organizing PWF-nets that are composed of workflow patterns. Considering the characteristics of PDP, PWF-nets are somewhat complex unlike existing workflow modeling because they manage necessary information related to dynamic workflow execution. Thus, we define transition behaviors and function primitives to support the construction of workflow patterns for PWF-nets. These workflow patterns can be microscopically handled and can be adapted for the dynamic and uncertain environment related to data and time. Next, we discuss the soundness and properties of the PWF-net and introduce an example of implementation. Additionally, we can check errors or abnormal executions of workflow and evaluate the lead time of PDP through our program for the PWF-net.},

abstract = {Motivation:  There is extensive interest in automating the collection, organization and analysis of biological data. Data in the form of images in online literature present special challenges for such efforts. The first steps in understanding the contents of a figure are decomposing it into panels and determining the type of each panel. In biological literature, panel types include many kinds of images collected by different techniques, such as photographs of gels or images from microscopes. We have previously described the SLIF system ( http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu) that identifies panels containing fluorescence microscope images among figures in online journal articles as a prelude to further analysis of the subcellular patterns in such images. This system contains a pretrained classifier that uses image features to assign a type (class) to each separate panel. However, the types of panels in a figure are often correlated, so that we can consider the class of a panel to be dependent not only on its own features but also on the types of the other panels in a figure.  Results:  In this article, we introduce the use of a type of probabilistic graphical model, a factor graph, to represent the structured information about the images in a figure, and permit more robust and accurate inference about their types. We obtain significant improvement over results for considering panels separately.

The surface topography and internal defect under different process conditions were studied. An internal defect named "hollow" was observed in microstructures made without vacuum. To investigate the morphology (crystal and phase), the microstructures samples were cut to slices with 10 μm thickness along the filling direction. Results of polarized light microscopic observation reveal that these microstructures also represent "skin-core" morphology, i.e. a highly oriented non-crystalline skin layer, a shear zone with column crystal essentially parallel to the injection direction and a spherulites core. However the morphology distribution of microstructures is different from the macroscopic structure: the non-crystalline layer is much thinner, the ratio of skin layer (non-crystalline and column crystal layer) to core thickness is very big, there is no change of spherulites dimension from skin to center. So the microstructures must have a special mechanical performance differ from the macroscopic parts.},

However, it is also very difficult to design robust nonlinear filters that respond exclusively to features of interest and that are, at the same time, equivariant with respect to translation and rotation. This paper proposes a new class of rotation-equivariant nonlinear filters that is based on the principle of group integration. These filters become efficiently computable by an iterative scheme based on repeated differentiation of products and summations of intermediate results. The relations of the proposed approach to Volterra filters and steerable filters are shown. In the context of detection problems, the filter may be interpreted as some kind of generalized Hough transform. The experiments show that the new filter can be used for enhancing noisy contours and rapid object detection in microscopical images. In the detection context, our experiments show that the proposed filter is definitely superior to alternative approaches, when high localization accuracy is required.},

abstract = {Thin films of InSb were grown on p-type porous silicon (PSi) (111) substrates by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to obtain monocrystalline InSb epilayer on a PSi substrate for low cost device applications. The structural characterization of the devices was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that InSb monocrystalline epilayer was successfully grown onto PSi. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of n-InSb/p-PSi heterojunction devices were measured in the temperature range of 298-398K. The measurements indicate that these heterojunctions have good rectifying characteristics. The estimated zero-bias barrier height @f"B"O and the ideality factor @h show strong temperature dependence. The conventional Richardson plot exhibits linear behavior in the entire temperature range indicating that the conduction seems to be predominantly due to thermionic emission mechanism. In addition, the capacitance-voltage characteristics are investigated at frequency of 1MHz. The built-in potential of the heterojunction is determined after eliminating the effect of the capacitance effect of the interface state caused by the lattice mismatch.},

abstract = {Epitaxial strontium titanate (SrTiO"3 or STO) thin films were prepared by an off-axis pulsed laser deposition technique on neodymium gallate (NdGaO"3 or NGO) substrates held at temperature of 820^oC. This technique allows different film growth rates in a deposition. Coplanar capacitors were fabricated and dielectric responses were measured at 1MHz and at 2GHz, and from 300K to 4K. The electric field tunability of the dielectric constant and loss tangent were taken with a range of electric field. The structure and morphology of the films were analyzed using high-resolution X-ray diffractometry and atomic force microscopy, respectively. The results showed that the films are crystalline with (100) orientation and the grains are columnar. Increased in-plane grain size and reduced surface to volume ratio were found to play a major role in improved performance of the film coplanar capacitors. The film with the growth rate of approximate 40A/min showed the highest change in the dielectric constant with an electric field of 4V/@mm. The film also showed the largest in-plane grain size of about 3000A.},

abstract = {Building a digital three dimensional representation of a human brain is a challenging task. Such a model provides insights into the microstructure of cortical layering and columns. The presented work is based on a complete dissected and preserved human brain that has been serially sectioned at a coronal resolution that is suitable for single cell detection. More than 6000 sections have been generated and exist as digital images. To obtain a valuable three dimensional representation, morphology preserving affine linear and nonlinear registration schemes are necessary steps. To rebuild a serially sectioned brain, reference images derived from a non deformed object, e.g., MRI or block face images, are necessary for a faithful affine linear and nonlinear registration. In the case of block face images the brain regions must be separated from highly variable background regions to obtain a suitable stack of segmentation images. Among the image segmentation algorithms we found fuzzy c-means techniques as a promising starting point for a sophisticated segmentation framework of either gray level or color images within 2- and 3-dimensions. With respect to algorithmic complexity and computation cost, two fuzzy c-means algorithms were implemented. A proper image preprocessing strategy turned out to be necessary for accurate and robust segmentation results. Primarily, the algorithms work in a parametric resp. supervised mode. Additionally, an automatic mode helps to explore the parameter space within a reasonable range and to compare the segmentation result with an optimal one, provided by an expert. By minimizing the differences we can set up parameters that are used for series of adjacent images. So, it is possible to obtain optimal segmentations independent of illumination disturbances, artifacts and defocusing. We present a complete high resolution and accurate segmentation of the first complete human brain that was sectioned, photographed and digitized at histologic resolution. Based on these images, a succeeding 3D representation is presented. Finally, a segmented and spatially correct straightened data set is available now for coregistration tasks together with the high resolution histologic data set.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computer vision approach to automated rapid-throughput taxonomic identification of stonefly larvae. The long-term objective of this research is to develop a cost-effective method for environmental monitoring based on automated identification of indicator species. Recognition of stonefly larvae is challenging because they are highly articulated, they exhibit a high degree of intraspecies variation in size and color, and some species are difficult to distinguish visually, despite prominent dorsal patterning. The stoneflies are imaged via an apparatus that manipulates the specimens into the field of view of a microscope so that images are obtained under highly repeatable conditions. The images are then classified through a process that involves (a) identification of regions of interest, (b) representation of those regions as SIFT vectors (Lowe, in Int J Comput Vis 60(2):91–110, 2004) (c) classification of the SIFT vectors into learned “features” to form a histogram of detected features, and (d) classification of the feature histogram via state-of-the-art ensemble classification algorithms. The steps (a) to (c) compose the concatenated feature histogram (CFH) method. We apply three region detectors for part (a) above, including a newly developed principal curvature-based region (PCBR) detector. This detector finds stable regions of high curvature via a watershed segmentation algorithm. We compute a separate dictionary of learned features for each region detector, and then concatenate the histograms prior to the final classification step. We evaluate this classification methodology on a task of discriminating among four stonefly taxa, two of which, Calineuria and Doroneuria, are difficult even for experts to discriminate. The results show that the combination of all three detectors gives four-class accuracy of 82% and three-class accuracy (pooling Calineuria and Doro-neuria) of 95%. Each region detector makes a valuable contribution. In particular, our new PCBR detector is able to discriminate Calineuria and Doroneuria much better than the other detectors.},

abstract = {Ammonia-citrate bath has been investigated for the deposition of nano crystalline Ni–W alloy micro components using the LIGA process. First the bath stability and deposit characteristics were studied. Fabrication of micro specimens were then carried out on silicon substrates covered with novolac as well as thick PMMA resist for LIGA. Effects of different parameters like current density, nickel ion and tungsten ion concentration in the bath, deposition time etc. on the deposit characteristics and current efficiency were studied. The deposited Ni–W samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy depressive X-ray spectroscopy, light optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Results show that during a few tens of hours of deposition, ammonia loss from the covered bath used is minimal and the bath remains stable. Selection of proper bath and deposition parameters allows a window for the deposition of crack free, thick, nano crystalline nickel–tungsten alloys. Using the optimum parameters, it has been possible to fabricate Ni-12 at% W micro tensile specimens with a nominal thickness of 120&nbsp;μm by the LIGA process.},

Different morphologies were observed for different substrate temperatures, but otherwise identical growth conditions. The experimental measurements reveal the evolutions of the crystalline states and bond structures following the substrate temperatures. Besides, different substrate materials also affected the tungsten oxide nanostructures. Bundles of wire-type tungsten oxide nanowires with a length of up to 5mm were obtained on Al2O3 substrate. Furthermore, the sensitive properties of the super long nanowires to the gas and different temperature were investigated. The dependence of the sensitivity of tungsten oxide nanowires to the methane as a function of the time was obtained. The sensitive properties of the tungsten oxide nanowires have almost linear relationship with the temperature.},

The morphology, composition, and structure of the product CuO nanowires were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and UV-Visible absorption. Selected oxidation processes have been monitored using a thermogravimetric analyzer.

Vitamin B2 was used as reducing agent as well as capping agent due to its high-water solubility, biodegradability, and low-toxicity compared with other reducing agents. The average particle size of nanoprticle was found to be Ag (average size 6.1±0.1 nm) and Pd (average size 4.1±0.1 nm) nanoparticles in ethylene glycol and Ag (average size 5.9±0.1 nm, and average size 6.1±0.1) nanoparticles in acetic acid and NMP, respectively. The formation of noble multiple shape nanostructures and their self assembly were dependent on the solvent employed for the preparation. When water was used as solvent media, Ag and Pd nanoparticles started to self-assemble into rodlike structures and in isopropanol Ag and Pd nanoparticles yielded wire-like structures with a thickness in the range of 10 to 20 nm and several hundred microns in length. In acetone and acetonitrile medium, the Ag and Pd nanoparticles are self-assembled into a regular pattern making nanorod structures with thicknesses ranging from 100 to 200nm and lengths of a few microns. The so-synthesized nanostructures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and UV spectroscopy. The ensuing Ag and Pd nanoparticles catalyzed the reactions of aniline and pyrrole to generate polyaniline and polypyrrole nanofibers and may find various technological and biological applications. This single-step greener approach is general and can be extended to other noble metals and transition metal oxides.},

The structure and morphology of the resulting membranes were investigated by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The effects of the type of the antisolvent and the presence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) on membrane morphology and the crystal structure developed within the membranes were studied. The crystallization of the PVDF upon immersion precipitation occurred predominantly in the α-phase when water is used as the antisolvent or in the absence of the carbon nanotubes. On the other hand, β-phase crystallization of the PVDF was promoted upon the use of ethanol as the antisolvent in conjunction with the incorporation of the MWNTs. The morphology and the total crystallinity of the PVDF membranes were also affected by the incorporation of the MWNTs and the antisolvent used, suggesting that the microstructure and the ultimate properties of the PVDF membranes can be engineered upon the judicious selection of crystallization conditions and the use of carbon nanotubes.},

The prepared nanoclusters, characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), have shown a constant spherical morphology with a size dimension of 5-6 nm in diameter. After their synthesis, no morphological evolution and irreversible aggregation process has been observed after a storage in CH2Cl2 at low temperature for a period up to six months long. Cu T6SH nanoparticles have been investigated by UV-Visible (UV-Vis) and Fourier transmission infrared (FTIR) spectroscopes to characterize the alkylthiophenes monolayer conformations and the particles optoelectronic properties. The UV-Vis reveals the lack of the surface plasmonic band, previously observed in Cu-nanosized clusters at about 556-570 nm, and shows a wide-band centered at 293 nm, probably due to the high-conformational surface ordering of thiophene rings on the Cu core. The results highlight the importance of the modifications ported to the well-known one-phase synthetic reactions to obtain a clear lack, even after a storage of six months, of any irreversible aggregation that has always characterized chain thiophene-protected metallic nanoparticles.},

The process pressure (PP) and substrate temperature (TS) at which deposition occurred were varied systematically between 0.26 Pa-1.60 Pa and between 15.0°C-600°C, respectively, and their effects on the chemical composition, surface morphology, and preferred orientation were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The EDS analysis confirms increasing nitrogen content with increasing PP and TS. The SEM images reveal a uniform and crystallized surface morphology as well as a closely packed cross-sectional morphology for all crystalline films and a loosely packed cross-sectional morphology for amorphous films. Films produced at lower PP and TS have a pyramidal surface morphology which transitions to a columnar and stratified structure as PP and TS increase. The XRD analysis confirms the existence of only the δ-TiN phase and the absence of other nitrides, oxides, and/or sillicides in all cases. It also indicates that at lower PP and TS, the preferred orientation relative to the substrate is along the (111) planes, and that it transitions to a random orientation along the (200), (220), and (311) planes as PP and TS increase and these results correlate with and qualify those observed by SEM.},

abstract = {The effect of mechanical stirring on the morphology of hexagonal layer-structure birnessite nanoparticles produced from decomposition of KMnO4 in dilute aqueous H2SO4 is investigated, with characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and N2 adsorption (BET). Mechanical stirring during an initial stage of synthesis is shown to produce black birnessite containing nanofibers, whereas granular particulates of brown birnessite are produced without stirring. This is the first reduction synthesis of black birnessite nanoparticles with dendritic morphology without any use of organic reductant, and suggests that a particular morphology can arise from structural preferences of Mn in acidic conditions rather than particular organic reactants. These results enlighten the possibility of synthesizing nanoparticles with controlled size and morphology.},

abstract = {Motivation: Automated identification of cell cycle phases captured via fluorescent microscopy is very important for understanding cell cycle and for drug discovery. In this article, we propose a novel cell detection method that utilizes both the intensity and shape information of the cell for better segmentation quality. In contrast to conventional off-line learning algorithms, an Online Support Vector Classifier (OSVC) is thus proposed, which removes support vectors from the old model and assigns new training examples weighted according to their importance to accommodate the ever-changing experimental conditions.Results: We image three cell lines using fluorescent microscopy under different experiment conditions, including one treated with taxol. Then, we segment and classify the cell types into interphase, prophase, metaphase and anaphase. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed system in image segmentation and cell phase identification.Availability: The software and test datasets are available from the authors.

In particular, this is true when dealing with microscopic images of cells and vessels. To facilitate the automation of cell screening, we have developed methods based on vector quantization and Markov model for classification of cellular phases using time-lapse fluorescence microscopic image sequences. Because of ambiguity inherently existing in the labeling of cell-phase feature vectors, we proposed to use relaxation labeling technique to reduce uncertainty among cell-phase models having overlapping properties. To further improve the classification rate we applied a fuzzy fusion strategy for combining individual results obtained from multiple classifiers. Our proposed image-classification methods can be useful for the task of high-content cell-cycle screening which is essential for biomedical research in the study of structures and functions of cells and molecules.},

abstract = {Motivation: Determining locations of protein expression is essential to understand protein function. Advances in green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion proteins and automated fluorescence microscopy allow for rapid acquisition of large collections of protein localization images. Recognition of these cell images requires an automated image analysis system. Approaches taken by previous work concentrated on designing a set of optimal features and then applying standard machine-learning algorithms. In fact, trends of recent advances in machine learning and computer vision can be applied to improve the performance. One trend is the advances in multiclass learning with error-correcting output codes (ECOC). Another trend is the use of a large number of weak detectors with boosting for detecting objects in images of real-world scenes.Results: We take advantage of these advances to propose a new learning algorithm, AdaBoost.ERC, coupled with weak and strong detectors, to improve the performance of automatic recognition of protein subcellular locations in cell images. We prepared two image data sets of CHO and Vero cells and downloaded a HeLa cell image data set in the public domain to evaluate our new method. We show that AdaBoost.ERC outperforms other AdaBoost extensions. We demonstrate the benefit of weak detectors by showing significant performance improvements over classifiers using only strong detectors. We also empirically test our method's capability of generalizing to heterogeneous image collections. Compared with previous work, our method performs reasonably well for the HeLa cell images.Availability: CHO and Vero cell images, their corresponding feature sets (SSLF and WSLF), our new learning algorithm, AdaBoost.ERC, and Supplementary Material are available at http://aiia.iis.sinica.edu.tw/ Contact: chunnan@iis.sinica.edu.tw Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

By properly selecting growth temperature, three kinds of nanostructure, islands, pits and ripples were formed. For growth temperature of 400-450^oC, the surface morphologies were governed by islands; but, for the growth temperature of 500^oC, the formation of surface ripples instead of islands was presumably due to the combination effect of temperature-controlled surface kinetics and strain effect. On the other hand, the observation of enhanced growth of pits upon a high-temperature annealing (at 685^oC for 90s) indicated that the strained InP epitaxial film would be morphologically stabilized by taking the form of pits formation.},

Mieussens, A smooth transition between kinetic and hydrodynamic equations, Journal of Computational Physics 209 (2005) 665-694] in which we presented an automatic domain decomposition method for the solution of gas dynamics problems which require a localized resolution of the kinetic scale. The basic idea is to couple the macroscopic hydrodynamics model and the microscopic kinetic model through a buffer zone in which both equations are solved. Discontinuities or sharp gradients of the solution are responsible for locally strong departures to local equilibrium which require the resolution of the kinetic model. The buffer zone is drawn around the kinetic region by introducing a cut-off function, which takes values between zero and one and which is identically zero in the fluid zone and one in the kinetic zone. In the present paper, we specifically consider the possibility of moving the kinetic region or creating new kinetic regions, by evolving the cut-off function with respect to time. We present algorithms which perform this task by taking into account indicators which characterize the non-equilibrium state of the gas. The method is shown to be highly flexible as it relies on the time evolution of the buffer cut-off function rather than on the geometric definition of a moving interface which requires remeshing, by contrast to many previous methods. Numerical examples are presented which validate the method and demonstrate its performances.},

Such biosignatures are important for vaccine validation and to provide risk stratification to a population such as for the identification of individuals who are exposed to biological or chemical agents and who are at high risk for developing an infection. The research goal is to detect broad based biosignature models and is initially focused on developing effective computer-augmented pathology tied to animal models developed at the University of New Mexico (UNM). Using lung tissue from infected and na\i{}¨ve mice, feature extraction from images of the tissue under a specialized microscope, and Bayesian networks to analyze the data sets of features, we were able to differentiate normal from diseased samples and viral from bacterial samples in mid to late stages of infection. This effort has shown the potential effectiveness of computer-augmented pathology in this application. The extended research intends to couple analysis of serum, microarray analysis of organs, proteomic data and the pathology. The rational for the current invasive procedure on animal models is to facilitate the development of data analysis and machine learning techniques that can eventually be generalized to the task of discovering non-invasive and early stage biosignatures for human models.},

The fabricated samples have been characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, silica optical fiber, and quartz crystal microbalance transducers have been simultaneously exposed at room temperature to toluene and xylene individual vapors in the ppm range. For each transducer type, a time division multiplexing approach has been exploited, enabling the simultaneous interrogation of up to 8 optical and 6 acoustic probes, respectively. The results obtained indicate that both optical and acoustic sensors provide very high reproducibility and sensitivity either towards toluene or xylene, with a resolution of few hundreds of ppb. Furthermore, sensitivities and response times turned out to be dependent on the particular analytes used for the vapors testing. Both transducer types demonstrate a similar response time, while with regard the recovery time, the optical detection seems to be significantly faster than the electrical counterpart. The effect of the SWCNTs monolayers number on sensors sensitivity and response time has also been investigated, demonstrating the possibility to enhance the performances of the proposed transducers by tailoring the geometric properties of the sensitive nanomaterial.},

For high order optimality systems under natural boundary conditions, it is shown that the convergence criteria of Hackbusch (Iterative Solution of Large Sparse Systems of Equations. Springer, Berlin, 1993) are met. Specifically, the Galerkin formalism is used together with a multi-colored ordering of unknowns to permit vectorization of a symmetric successive over-relaxation on image processing systems. The geometric multigrid procedure is situated as an inner iteration within an outer Newton or lagged diffusivity iteration, which in turn is embedded within a pyramidal scheme that initializes each outer iteration from predictions obtained on coarser levels. Differences between results obtainable by finite displacements and by optical flows are elucidated. Specifically, independence of image order can be shown for optical flow but in general not for finite displacements. Also, while autonomous optical flows are used in practice, it is shown explicitly that finite displacements generate a broader class of registrations. This work is motivated by applications in histological reconstruction and in dynamic medical imaging, and results are shown for such realistic examples.},

abstract = {This paper describes a microsimulation program developed to study freeway ramp merging phenomena under congested traffic conditions. The results of extensive macroscopic and microscopic studies are used to establish a model for the behavior of merging drivers. A theoretical framework for modeling the ramp and freeway lag driver acceleration-deceleration behavior guided the model development. This methodology uses the stimuli-response psychophysical concept as a fundamental rule and is formulated as a modified form of the conventional car-following models. Data collected at the two merging points are used to calibrate the hypothesized ramp and freeway lag vehicle acceleration models. Drawing on this behavioral model, the freeway merging capacity simulation program (FMCSP) is developed to simulate actual traffic conditions. This model evaluates the capacity of a merging section for a given geometric design and flow condition. Validation of FMCSP is performed using the observed flow, vehicle trajectories, and lane-changing maneuvers. The simulation model is applied to investigate a variety of merging strategies. The results indicated that the FMCSP is capable of simulating the actual traffic conditions of congested freeway ramp merging sections and will aid in the development of traffic management strategies for complex freeway ramp merging areas.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses showed that the Hf metal layer transformed into HfO"2 during the post-deposition annealing process. It appears that the HfO"2 layer formed by the oxidation of Hf metal provided the underlying ALD HfO"2 layer with the nucleation sites necessary to decrease the grain-boundary density of the crystallized HfO"2 film. The decrease in the grain-boundary density resulted in a reduction in the Hf-silicate formation and interfacial layer growth during post deposition annealing. This eventually resulted in a smaller increase in the capacitance equivalent thickness (CET) and high-k characteristics in the CET vs. leakage current density curve even after post deposition annealing at 1000 ^oC.},

These results suggest that a strong reaction with the Ge substrate may take place so that a La-Ge-O compound may form over the entire film thickness reducing the k-value.

abstract = {Controlled aggregation of tetrakis-(4-(hexadecyl oxy)-phenyl) porphyrin and its copper(II)-complex was studied in mix-solvent system at room temperature. Structure of the aggregates was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-visible spectroscopy. TEM results indicated the formation of organized nanostructures from the porphyrin derivative and its corresponding copper(II)-complex. XRD results showed that the bulk and nanostructured free porphyrin derivatives had the similar crystalline morphology. UV-visible-NIR spectroscopic data showed broad red-shifted Soret band, indicating JJ aggregation among the monomer units. Conjugate effect of lateral pipi interaction among the tetrapyrrole cores and hydrophobic interaction among the long alkane chains substituted in the peripheral phenyl rings is believed to lead to the organized nanostructures. Effect of solvent ratio on the aggregate structure is also revealed.},

Characterization of phase composition and crystallite structure of the barriers was performed by XRD, the film morphology was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the composition profiles of the as-deposited and annealed samples of Cu/Zr-N/Si were identified by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). It is evident that the Zr-N film structure is very sensitive to the deposition conditions. Cu/Zr-N/Si contact systems showed better thermal stability so that the Cu"3Si phase could not be detected. It is indicated from the comparison analysis results that the Zr-N film showed better thermal stability with increasing N"2 flow ratio and/or negative substrate bias.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of learning with incomplete information as exemplified by learning with delayed reinforcement. We study a two phase learning scenario in which a phase of Hebbian associative learning based on momentary internal representations is supplemented by an ‘unlearning’ phase depending on a graded reinforcement signal. The reinforcement signal quantifies the success-rate globally for a number of learning steps in phase one, and ‘unlearning’ is indiscriminate with respect to associations learnt in that phase. Learning according to this model is studied via simulations and analytically within a student–teacher scenario for both single layer networks and, for a committee machine. Success and speed of learning depend on the ratio λ of the learning rates used for the associative Hebbian learning phase and for the unlearning-correction in response to the reinforcement signal, respectively. Asymptotically perfect generalization is possible only, if this ratio exceeds a critical value λ c , in which case the generalization error exhibits a power law decay with the number of examples seen by the student, with an exponent that depends in a non-universal manner on the parameter λ. We find these features to be robust against a wide spectrum of modifications of microscopic modelling details. Two illustrative applications—one of a robot learning to navigate a field containing obstacles, and the problem of identifying a specific component in a collection of stimuli—are also provided.},

abstract = {We have studied the effect of deviations from doping uniformity in source and drain on the performance of sub-20 nm silicon double-gate MOSFET devices. The study is motivated by recent direct observation of such inhomogeneities in small MOSFET devices. The model assumes a continuous charge distribution with randomly located regions of high doping. Individual dopants are not resolved. Impurity scattering in the source and drain regions is neglected. The current-voltage characteristics are computed for devices that differ only in the microscopic arrangement of the randomly distributed high doping regions. We have also studied devices that differ in the number of these clusters. An ensemble of devices with fluctuating numbers of clusters has been constructed based on a Gaussian distribution centered on the mean cluster number derived from the average doping concentration in the source/drain. The impact of high doping clusters, particularly on charge injection, has been studied in detail for the first time using full quantum simulation based on the 2D nonequilibrium Green function approach coupled self-consistently to Poisson's equation. We have assumed an average lateral symmetry for the double-gate MOSFET. Therefore, we only consider inhomogeneities in doping in the plane of the simulation. The devices studied have 12 nm channel lengths which allows the approximation of ballistic quantum transport through the self-consistent electrostatic potential landscape of the device. The computed current-voltage characteristics are monotonic and they are most strongly affected by the fluctuations in the total number of high doping regions. Fluctuations in the spatial configuration of clusters have a lesser effect. Threshold voltages shifts around 100 mV and on-current fluctuations around 50% are obtained from the simulations. However, the subthreshold slope remains almost independent of the microscopic cluster distribution. The on-current variations are considerably larger than- those predicted from classical modeling.},

Based on these measured features of traffic breakdown at the bottleneck as well as on the Kerner-Klenov microscopic traffic model in the context of the author's three-phase traffic theory, critical discussions of earlier traffic flow models for freeway control simulations and of ALINEA methods of Papageorgiou for feedback on-ramp metering are made. An alternative congested pattern control approach to feedback on-ramp metering ANCONA introduced by the author in 2004 is numerically studied. In ANCONA, congestion at the bottleneck is allowed to set in. However, ANCONA maintains speeds within a congested pattern higher than about 60 km/h and prevents upstream propagation of the pattern. To reach these goals, after traffic breakdown has occurred spontaneously at the bottleneck, ANCONA tries to return to free flow via reduction of on-ramp inflow. A critical comparison of ANCONA with ALINEA and UP-ALINEA is made},

abstract = {To meet the demand of an increasing storage density, the lubricant film for the head disk interface (HDI) needs to be thinner and stronger. In recent years, a new head/disk system, such as the contact type, has been proposed. It is reported that PFPE Zdol coated on a magnetic disk is dewetted and microdroplets are formed due to polar interactions. This makes a flying magnetic head unstable, therefore, the physics and chemistry of the dewetting phenomenon are topics of current interest. We investigated the formation and development of microdroplets using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and an optical microscope. First, we observed the disk surface coated with PFPE Zdol by AFM. From the cross section images of the microdroplets, we found that the microdroplets had a shape similar to a sphere. With this finding, we estimated the contact angle of the microdroplets in each image. The results showed that the contact angle of the microdroplet gradually decreased with time, which indicated the existence of a PFPE thin film in the dewetted area. The thickness of the PFPE film in the dewetted area was then measured using an elliposometer. Next, we investigated the variation in the number and the average diameter of the microdroplets during dewetting using images observed by the optical microscope. The total surface area change was also calculated from the observed results, and it was found that the total surface area, namely the sum of the microdroplet surfaces and dewetted area, was reduced by the development of the microdroplets.},

The height of the oxide ridge can be controlled with sub-nanometer accuracy by the applied voltage and the width can be controlled by the tip radius. The depth and width of the groove can be controlled by adjusting the height and width of the ridge. Nanostructures with a very small height or depth (about 50 nm wide and &lt; 1 nm high or deep) can be fabricated by our method.

In a few years, electrical junctions will reach a depth of ~20nm and the electrical characteristics of these junction conditions the working of a transistor. However, this downscaling has not been followed by a parallel downscaling of the characterization techniques. As a matter of fact, the spreading resistance probe (SRP) technique commonly used for carrier profiling is not suited anymore for ultra-shallow junction profiling, mainly because of the dimensions of the measurement tool. We have thus developed a new concept, the NanoProfiler, based on the downscaling of the SRP technique to atomic force microscopy (AFM) concept. This paper presents the first achievements towards the practical realization of such a novel promising technique: realization of double sharp tips with sub-micron spacing, and of cantilevers with integrated conducting channels to individually connect both tips to the outside world for data acquisition. We separately designed two fabrication processes for making double tips with sub-micron spacing and for making cantilevers with integrated conducting channels, thus proving the feasibility of the NanoProfiler concept.},

We suggest items and nanopatterns that can be applied to the reliability assessment tests.

In comparison, we show that an ordered array of P dots ~6 nm in diameter and containing ~50 P atoms separated by ~4 nm shows nonlinear I-V, characteristic of a series of metallic dots separated by tunnel barriers. These results highlight the use of STM lithography to pattern ordered dopants in silicon down to the sub-10 nm scale},

abstract = {Saliency is an important perceptual cue that occurs at different levels of resolution. Important attributes of saliency are symmetry, continuity, and closure. Detection of these attributes is often hindered by noise, variation in scale, and incomplete information. This paper introduces the iterative voting method, which uses oriented kernels for inferring saliency as it relates to symmetry. A unique aspect of the technique is the kernel topography, which is refined and reoriented iteratively. The technique can cluster and group nonconvex perceptual circular symmetries along the radial line of an object's shape. It has an excellent noise immunity and is shown to be tolerant to perturbation in scale. The application of this technique to images obtained through various modes of microscopy is demonstrated. Furthermore, as a case example, the method has been applied to quantify kinetics of nuclear foci formation that are formed by phosphorylation of histone gammaH2AX following ionizing radiation. Iterative voting has been implemented in both 2-D and 3-D for multi image analysis},

It is found that C-AFM working at normal operational voltages causes severe damage and subsequent negative charge trapping in the oxide. Permanent hillocks are seen in the topography of stressed regions. The height of these features is determined rather by the applied voltage than the electric field. Electrostatic repulsion between tip and sample and Si epitaxy underneath the oxide are the two most probable causes of this feature. The immediate physical damage caused in the oxide during high field C-AFM measurements is a possible showstopper for use of the C-AFM to investigate differences in pristine interface states. SCM operates at lower voltages, yielding less oxide damage and is able to indicate the interface state density variations through hysteresis in the dC/dV vs. V curves.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach based on conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM) for nano-scale mapping in laterally inhomogeneous metal-semiconductors Schottky contacts. For ultra-thin (1-5nm) metal films with resistivity exceeding by about two orders of magnitude the bulk value, the current localization under the tip (10-20nm diameter) occurs. By spectroscopic analysis of the current-voltage characteristics for different tip positions, the 2D Schottky barrier height (SBH) distribution is obtained with ~0.1eV energy resolution. The method was applied to explain the experimentally observed SBH lowering in macroscopic Au/4H-SiC diodes, in the presence of a not uniform SiO"2 layer at the SiC/Au interface. Nano-scale mapping on the oxide free Au/4H-SiC contact demonstrates a SBH distribution peaked at 1.8eV and with tails from 1.6eV to 2.1eV. When ~2nm not uniform SiO"2 layer is intentionally grown on SiC before contact formation, the Au/SiO"2/4H-SiC SBH distribution exhibits a 0.3eV lowering in the peak and a broadening (tails from 1.1eV to 2.1eV), thus explaining the macroscopically observed average effect.},

Aim of the work is a brief discussion of the starting-points for inline process inspection within a direct LIGA technology using deep X-ray lithography for the production of micromechanical gear wheels with critical dimensions of ~35 μm width at ~1 mm height as well as to show methodic and technical measuring possibilities. Firstly, results of the determination of residual solvent content distribution within ultra-thick SU-8 films are shown obtained from refracted near field optical measurements. Furthermore, the capability of X-ray computer tomographic imaging is discussed and measurements for the determination of the three-dimensional shape of high aspect ratio microstructures are practically demonstrated with microscopic and interferometric optical methods. Finally, first results demonstrate the potential of the optical coherence tomography for several further important measurement tasks, among others, e.g. for the imaging of the distribution of mechanical stress at the resist---substrate interface. The results show that much information which is essential in the LIGA process can be achieved with recently available measurement methods. However, further development of non-destructive measurement techniques would be desirable for an effective inline process control of mass production of micromechanical parts.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental objectives of computer vision is to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) structure of objects from two-dimensional (2D) images. Shape from focus (SFF) is the problem of reconstructing the depth of the scene changing actively the optics of the camera until the point of interest is in focus. The point in focus gives information about its depth through the thin lens Gaussian law. Previous SFF algorithms use 2D window for finding the best focused points. In this paper, we propose to use 3D window for finding the best focused points. The new SFF algorithm is applied on the camera mounted microscope for developing an auto-grinding equipment of LCD color filters. In order to develop thin and bright displays, TFT-LCD is used nowadays. In the manufacturing process of TFT-LCD panels, cells and color filters are put together. The protrusion which is generated by combining the two unequal sizes (difference in microns) of glasses in the construction of LCD panels causes a big problem. Therefore, the protrusion is cut to the proper height before the two glasses are put together. Usually, the number of cells in a typical TFT/LCD display is in millions. The time for the checking and cutting of protrusions greatly affects the cost of manufacturing. We, therefore, propose the use of the proposed SFF algorithms for the said problem for fast and accurate process},

abstract = {Strain has significance for both the growth characteristics and material properties of thin epitaxial films. In this work, the method of lattice statics is applied to an epitaxial system with cubic symmetry, using harmonic potentials. The energy density and force balance equations are written using a finite difference formalism that clearly shows their consistency with continuum elasticity. For simplicity, the atomic interactions are assumed to be maximally localized. For a layered material system with a material/vacuum interface and with surface steps, force balance equations are derived, and intrinsic surface stress at the material/vacuum interface is included by treating the atoms at the surface as having different elastic properties. By defining the strain relative to an appropriately chosen nonequilibrium lattice, as in the method of eigenstrains, analytic formulas in terms of microscopic parameters are found for the local force field near a step and for the macroscopic monopole and dipole moment forces due to a step. These results provide an atomistic validation of the Marchenko-Parshin formula for the dipole moment in terms of the elastic surface stress.},

abstract = {The availability of increased computing power will make possible new classes of biological models that include detailed representations of proteins and protein complexes with spatial interactions. We develop such a model of the interaction of actin and myosin within one pair of thick and thin filaments in the cardiac sarcomere. The model includes explicit representations of actin, myosin, and regulatory proteins. Although this is not an atomic-scale model, as would be the case for molecular dynamics simulations, the model seeks to represent spatial interactions between protein complexes that are thought to produce characteristic cardiac muscle responses at larger scales. While the model simulates the microscopic scale, when model results are extrapolated to larger structures, the model recapitulates complex, nonlinear behavior such as the steep calcium sensitivity of developed force in muscle structures. By bridging spatial scales, the model provides a plausible and quantitative explanation for several unexplained phenomena observed at the tissue level in cardiac muscles. Model execution entails Monte-Carlo-based simulations of Markov representations of calcium regulation and actin-myosin interactions. While most of the results presented here are preliminary, we suggest that this model will be suitable to serve as a basis for larger-scale simulations of multiple fibers assembled into larger sarcomere structures.},

abstract = {Nanomanipulation using the atomic force microscope (AFM) has been extensively investigated for many years. But the efficiency and accuracy of AFM-based nanomanipulation are still major issues due to the nonlinearities and uncertainties in nanomanipulation operations. The deformation of the cantilever caused by manipulation force is one of the most major nonlinearities and uncertainties. It causes difficulties in accurately controlling the tip position, and results in missing the position of the object. The softness of the conventional cantilevers also causes the failure of manipulation of sticky nano-objects because the tip can easily slip over the nano-objects. In this paper, an active atomic force microscopy probe is used as an adaptable end effector to solve these problems by actively controlling the cantilever's flexibility or rigidity during nanomanipulation. A control voltage is applied to the piezo layer of the adaptable end effector to exert a reverse bending moment on the cantilever to balance the bending moment caused by the interaction force during manipulation. Thus, the adaptable end effector is controlled to maintain straight shape during manipulation. A detailed model of the adaptable end effector is presented in the paper. Control of the adaptable end effector employing an optimal LQR control law is derived and implemented. The experimental results verify the validity of the model and effectiveness of the controller. The nanomanipulation results also prove the increased efficiency of AFM-based nanomanipulation using the adaptable end effector},

abstract = {Current approaches to study the system response of the different modes of dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) use model simplification such as single mode approximations or are based on the nontrivial solution of the equation of motion. As an alternative to these approaches, the transfer function analysis gives a more complete description of system dynamics considering the cantilever as an extended vibrating structure. In order to describe the dynamics correctly, the precise experimental configuration has to be taken into account. This includes distinguishing between point loads (mechanical tip sample interaction) and distributed loads induced, e.g., by inertial driving or electrostatic forces. In this work we focus on a transfer function study of two different AFM configurations, the point force and distributed force driven cantilever. Exact analytical expressions of the infinite dimensional transfer function are derived for both possible system outputs: cantilever deflection and slope, which correspond to an interferometric and a light lever deflection detection system, respectively. Frequency response and transfer function infinite product expansion are obtained for the case where system outputs are set at the free end of the cantilever. In the frequency response, it is reflected the full complexity of cantilever dynamics affected by the presence of an infinite number of poles and zeros. An analytical expression for all the zeros and poles of the system is obtained. Using the transfer function, system dynamics are analyzed obtaining modal and antiresonant cantilever shapes along with its step response. From the frequency response, pole-zero investigations, and system dynamics, it is shown that both cantilever actuation and output measurement affect AFM operation. Transfer function analysis of AFM cantilevers improves the possibility of model-based AFM operation to increase imaging and manipulation performance},

In this study, we carried out the selective deposition of HfO2 nano-thin films on Si(100) substrates by combination of muCP using octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Single molecular precursor of Hf(OtBu) 4 was used for the growth of HfO2 nano-films, and the deposition was carried out between 150degC and 400degC at a pressure of 3times10-2 torr. The as-grown films were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) measurement. It is expected that the combination of muCP of SAM and MOCVD is a better method for fabricating the HfO 2 thin films between micro and nano sizes},

The model is aimed at a full understanding of the functioning of the device down to microscopic level. The simulation consists briefly of following the transport histories of individual carriers. The time of free flight, the frequencies of the various types of interaction between the lattice and the carriers and the scattering angles have distinct stochastic distributions. By choosing random numbers with the same distributions, it is possible to simulate carrier transport. After a review of semiconductor physics, the details of the method is explained. This is followed by examples, mainly from simulation of GaAs MESFET's, to demonstrate some of the abilities of the model. The distributions of the carriers and fields are used to explain physical phenomena such as substrate currents and negative differential resistivity. The only parameters that enter the calculations are those describing the geometry of the device and those fundamental to the semiconductor, such as material constants, the phonon spectra and the band structure. Any adjustable, geometry dependent parameters do not enter the model.},

abstract = {We present a new analytical model to predict the spatial location of amorphous phases in ion-implanted single-crystalline silicon using results of multidimensional Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach is based on the concept of the critical damage energy density. Additionally, the self-annealing of radiation damage during ion implantation is taken into account because this effect is crucial for a correct prediction of amorphization. Two aspects of self-annealing are considered, namely, the temperature and the spatial dependence. The latter is related to the local damage energy density, which is simulated by one-, two-, and three-dimensional modules of our Monte Carlo program MCIMPL of the technology CAD framework VISTA. Therefore, the formation and the shape of amorphous regions in single-crystalline silicon can be predicted as a result of Monte Carlo simulations of ion implantation. The suggested model accurately reproduces the results of direct microscopic observations (XTEM measurements) of amorphous layers in silicon after a silicon self-implantation, which are available for a temperature range of 82-296 K},

The most critical singularity is determined in terms of crack initiation according to a criterion combining stress intensity and energy release rate conditions. In these interconnects, crack initiation appears to be intrinsically governed by energy release conditions, so that short cracks are very difficult to initiate or propagate. The absence of detectable cracks after bending is in good agreement with this prediction.},

A recursive solution for the probability distribution of binding of dNTPs is developed for a single cycle and is used to calculate expected yield for a multicycle PCR. The model is able to reproduce important features of the PCR amplification process quantitatively. With a set of favorable reaction conditions, the amplification of the target sequence is fast enough to rapidly outnumber all side products. Furthermore, the final yield of the target sequence in a multicycle PCR run always approaches an asymptotic limit that is less than one. The amplification process itself is highly sensitive to initial concentrations and the reaction rates of addition to the template strand of each type of dNTP in the solution.},

Ostwald ripening is studied here through the use of a mesoscopic model which is a stochastic partial integrodifferential equation that is derived from a spin exchange Ising model. This model is studied through the use of recently developed and benchmarked spectral schemes for the simulation of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations. The typical cluster size is observed to grow like t1/3 over range of times with faster growth at later times.

abstract = {In this paper we propose an approach in which interactive visualization and analysis are combined with batch tools for the processing of large data collections. Large and heterogeneous data collections are difficult to analyze and pose specific problems to interactive visualization. Application of the traditional interactive processing and visualization approaches as well as batch processing encounter considerable drawbacks for such large and heterogeneous data collections due to the amount and type of data. Computing resources are not sufficient for interactive exploration of the data and automated analysis has the disadvantage that the user has only limited control and feedback on the analysis process.In our approach, an analysis procedure with features and attributes of interest for the analysis is defined interactively. This procedure is used for off-line processing of large collections of data sets. The results of the batch process along with ``visual summaries'' are used for further analysis. Visualization is not only used for the presentation of the result, but also as a tool to monitor the validity and quality of the operations performed during the batch process. Operations such as feature extraction and attribute calculation of the collected data sets are validated by visual inspection. This approach is illustrated by an extensive case study, in which a collection of confocal microscopy data sets is analyzed.},

abstract = {It is well known for almost half a century that bones contain microcracks. Very little is known about the crack growth behaviour of very small cracks, e.g. the stage before they become macroscopically long. The aim of this work was to investigate the dynamic crack growth behaviour of sub-millimetre microcracks in cortical bone. It was found that slow stable crack growth occurs in specimens subjected to static loading conditions. Crack growth direction was dominated by the local fibre orientation of the bones. Crack angles varied between 10 and 36 degrees of the long axis of the bone. Short cracks were found to show periods of rapid growth followed by intervals of temporary crack arrest. Histological analysis showed that crack arrest occurred due to vascular canals in the bone. During these periods of crack arrest, crack opening displacements increased until the local strain was sufficient to overcome these features. These observations indicate a mechanism for growth of small cracks in bone at constant stress, involving microstructural barriers, time-dependent deformation of material near the crack tip and strain-controlled propagation.},

First, motivation for stress-strain analysis of SMCs is presented. Problems of their structure, geometry, constitutive models and initial (stress-free) state are analyzed on the basis of anatomical, histological and physiological knowledge. Various types of computational FE models of SMCs are presented; their constitutive models are identified on the basis of published mechanical tests carried out with SMCs cultured in vitro. Results of two models are presented; the former is a homogeneous model of the cell tension test with hyperelastic constitutive relations of the cell material. The latter model is more complex, it comprehends cortical and deep cytoskeleton, modelled as a tensegrity structure, and homogeneous linear elastic nucleus and remaining cytoplasm; it is used in computational modelling of indentation test. Perspectives, assumptions and limitations of computational modelling of SMCs under physiological load are discussed.},

abstract = {Miscible fluid mixtures, like pouring honey into water, Coca Cola into strong wine, are common phenomena in our daily life. While two miscible fluids are mixed together, their appearances in terms of colors and shapes will change due to their mixing interaction. The interaction between the mixture components could be regarded as a combination of the diffusing process and demixing process. If the former dominates the interaction, it is miscible; otherwise, it is immiscible. The complex microscopic interplay between the mixture components makes the simulation highly challenging. So far, there have been some dedicated research in computer graphics dealing with immiscible mixtures, but few works have been done focusing on miscible mixtures. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a two-fluid lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), called TFLBM, applied to miscible binary mixtures. Different from other similar methods, the viscous and diffusing properties of the fluid in our work are considered separately, so that the physical insight is exposed more clearly and rationally. In addition, the operation of LBM is mostly a linear local computation, and graphics processing unit (GPU) has been utilized to achieve real-time simulation.

This architecture is based on the competitive layer model (CLM), a dynamic feature binding model, which is applicable on a wide range of perceptual grouping and segmentation problems. A predefined target segmentation can be achieved as attractor states of this linear threshold recurrent network, if the lateral weights are chosen by Hebbian learning. The weight matrix is given by the correlation matrix of special pattern vectors with a structure dependent on the target labeling. Generalization is achieved by applying vector quantization on pair-wise feature relations, like proximity and similarity, defined by external knowledge. We show the successful application of the method to a number of artifical test examples and a medical image segmentation problem of fluorescence microscope cell images.},

abstract = {A real-time augmented reality (AR) user interface for nanoscale interaction and manipulation applications using an atomic force microscope (AFM) is presented. Nanoscale three-dimensional (3-D) topography and force information sensed by an AFM probe are fed back to a user through a simulated AR system. The sample surface is modeled with a B-spline-based geometry model, upon which a collision detection algorithm determines whether and how the spherical AFM tip penetrates the surface. Based on these results, the induced surface deformations are simulated using continuum micro/nanoforce and Maugis-Dugdale elastic contact mechanics models, and 3-D decoupled force feedback information is obtained in real time. The simulated information is then blended in real time with the force measurements of the AFM in an AR human machine interface, comprising a computer graphics environment and a haptic interface. Accuracy, usability, and reliability of the proposed AR user interface is tested by experiments for three tasks: positioning the AFM probe tip close to a surface, just in contact with a surface, or below a surface by elastically indenting. Results of these tests showed the performance of the proposed user interface. This user interface would be critical for many nanorobotic applications in biotechnology, nanodevice prototyping, and nanotechnology education},

Vertically aligned freestanding carbon nanofibers are produced by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and their deflection under applied voltage is measured using an optical microscope. The deflection is compared with a static force balance model, which successfully predicts the switching behavior assuming a nanofiber modulus of 40 GPa, which is consistent with independent modulus measurements made in our laboratory. The model is then extended to explore constraints for implementing a vertically aligned nanotube switch into present CMOS process flow. Carbon nanofibers of less than 40 nm in diameter, which may be grown by current PECVD technology, are shown to be acceptable for device integration for current and future CMOS scaling. To accommodate varying tube sizes and architectures, a basic scaling relationship is developed to relate CMOS via parameters and nanofiber characteristics to programming voltage},

The phenomenon of dedifferentiation, which occurs as cells develop towards malignancy is also well described. To identify an epithelial tumor-specific proteomic profile as well as to measure the proximities between we used data from tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue microdissected from head and neck and colon cancer samples which were analyzed using ProteinChip technology and performed a bioinformatic meta-analysis on the resulting four complex datasets.  Results:  All four groups could be identified based on their proteomic signatures and the tumor tissues were found to be more similar to one another than to the normal epithelial tissue from which they progressed. This study shows at the proteomic level that changes in the histological features of tumors as compared to the tissues from which they arise are reflected in the convergence of proteomic pattern during the development to cancer.

abstract = {Domain reference ontologies represent knowledge about a particular part of the world in a way that is independent from specific objectives, through a theory of the domain. An example of reference ontology in biomedical informatics is the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), an ontology of anatomy that covers the entire range of macroscopic, microscopic, and subcellular anatomy. The purpose of this paper is to explore how two domain reference ontologies--the FMA and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontology, can be used (i) to align existing terminologies, (ii) to infer new knowledge in ontologies of more complex entities, and (iii) to manage and help reasoning about individual data. We analyze those kinds of usages of these two domain reference ontologies and suggest desiderata for reference ontologies in biomedicine. While a number of groups and communities have investigated general requirements for ontology design and desiderata for controlled medical vocabularies, we are focusing on application purposes. We suggest five desirable characteristics for reference ontologies: good lexical coverage, good coverage in terms of relations, compatibility with standards, modularity, and ability to represent variation in reality.},

The geometrical cell structure was described by means of statistical distributions of the cell area, cell aspect ratio and cell orientation. The cell orientation and cell aspect ratio were calculated based on the moments of inertia (area moments) and least-square ellipse fitting, respectively.

Hereafter, some behavioral parameters like alternating steps showed an increase in occurence, while others remained stable. Sensory function was observed within the 7 weeks time frame. Nerve tissue had bridged the 10-mm gap within 7 weeks. The average nerve fiber surface area increased significantly in time. In situ degradation of the nerve conduit was fully going on at week 7 and tubes had collapsed by then. At weeks 15 and 21, the knitted tube wall structure was completely surrounded by macrophages and giant cells, and matrix was penetrating the tube wall.

abstract = {Motivation:  The CEBS data repository is being developed to promote a systems biology approach to understand the biological effects of environmental stressors. CEBS will house data from multiple gene expression platforms (transcriptomics), protein expression and protein--protein interaction (proteomics), and changes in low molecular weight metabolite levels (metabolomics) aligned by their detailed toxicological context. The system will accommodate extensive complex querying in a user-friendly manner. CEBS will store toxicological contexts including the study design details, treatment protocols, animal characteristics and conventional toxicological endpoints such as histopathology findings and clinical chemistry measures. All of these data types can be integrated in a seamless fashion to enable data query and analysis in a biologically meaningful manner.  Results:  An object model, the SysBio-OM (Xirasagar  et al ., 2004) has been designed to facilitate the integration of microarray gene expression, proteomics and metabolomics data in the CEBS database system. We now report SysTox-OM as an open source systems toxicology model designed to integrate toxicological context into gene expression experiments. The SysTox-OM model is comprehensive and leverages other open source efforts, namely, the Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data ( http://www.cdisc.org/models/send/v2/index.html ) which is a data standard for capturing toxicological information for animal studies and Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium ( http://www.cdisc.org/models/sdtm/index.html ) that serves as a standard for the exchange of clinical data. Such standardization increases the accuracy of data mining, interpretation and exchange. The open source SysTox-OM model, which can be implemented on various software platforms, is presented here.  Availability:  A universal modeling language (UML) depiction of the entire SysTox-OM is available at http://cebs.niehs.nih.gov and the Rational Rose object model package is distributed under an open source license that permits unrestricted academic and commercial use and is available at http://cebs.niehs.nih.gov/cebsdownloads .

abstract = {Arradiance is developing a novel approach for achieving the high brightness and intra-field beam uniformity required for volume production electron beam maskless lithography. The goal is to utilize an electron multiplying array operating in saturation to amplify, stabilize and control the output of an array of cold cathodes. The authors discuss advancements in both theoretical and experimental methods to characterize and optimize the channel structure of silicon based microchannel amplifiers (MCAs) operating both near and in deep saturation. Combined with experimental data from fabricated prototypes, this paper reports the recent results of new methodologies in modeling on both a macroscopic and a microscopic scale. This will enable the prediction and optimization of key operational parameters. In addition, new experimental methodologies have been developed to quantify the transfer characteristics of individual channels within large arrays. These new methods offer the high level of predictive capability required for both device optimization and fabrication control necessary to achieve lithography level source performance.},

abstract = {We present here the latest results of our manufacturable miniature scanning electron microscope (miniSEM) development effort that incorporates a micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) electrostatic microcolumn and a carbon nanotube (CNT) emitter. The microcolumn is designed for a beam diameter of 10-20nm at the sample with beam energy of 1keV at currents of up to 1nA and a 100@mm field of view (FOV). The microcolumn components are fabricated on a single 50@mm thick silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer and are assembled to the pre-fabricated, self-aligning sockets to realize an inexpensive and compact microcolumn. A new MEMS process presented here allows the microcolumn electrodes to withstand voltages in excess of +/-1kV which is the maximum design voltage for any electrode. We also present measured electron optic characteristics of an Einzel lens and an octupole deflector along with simulations. The operational testing of the entire microcolumn is currently in progress.},

The nanoscale dispenser consists of a silicon nitride atomic force microscope probe having an aperture in the apex of the hollow tip. This probe allows the deposition of individual ultrasmall droplets on a substrate, with volumes down to a few attoliters. The local deposition of liquid on a submicrometric scale can be used to induce a local modification of surface properties. Nanoscale dispensing was used to deposit an array of glycerol droplets on a self-organized micellar monolayer made of polystyrene-poly-2-vinylpyridine block-copolymers. The micelles had a poly-2-vinylpyridine core with a polystyrene corona. The presence of the glycerol droplets induced a local transformation in morphology and surface chemistry of the micellar monolayer. The area of the micellar film undergoing this reconfiguration was tuned by varying the deposition parameters during the nanoscale dispensing.},

The morphology of the sample was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements. The optical analysis of the samples after the dispersion of the NCs into the PMMA matrix and the exposure to the e-beam showed the successful localization of the colloidal NCs, whose emission properties were preserved.},

abstract = {Fresnel zone plate (FZP) lenses are, in many cases, essential elements to obtain X-ray microbeams in synchrotron light (SL) facilities. They have become a common optical device during the latest years. The increasing complexity of the relevant scientific problems is associated with an increasing demand on the optical performances of the X-ray microscopy to the point that the optical elements have to be tailored to fit the characteristics of the optical source and of the sample. This fact justifies a research effort to optimize and simplify the fabrication processes of such devices. However, FZP fabrication for X-ray wavelengths is not straightforward, since the involved dimensions are in the nanometer scale. A joint effort involving CELLS (consortium for the development of a synchrotron light source in Barcelona), the Optics Department of the Autonomous University and the Microelectronics Center in Barcelona has been recently undertaken in order to develop the processes for the fabrication of FZP lenses as X-ray focusing elements. In this paper, we present the first results using a very simple lift-off technique, which up to now allows the fabrication of FZP with sub-100nm resolution with 110nm metal rings.},

abstract = {The improvement of adhesion property of microresist pattern has been recognized as one important problem that needs to be solved in the nanoscale-device fabrication. As decreasing wavelength of the exposure source for miniaturizing the resist pattern, it is well known that the pattern shape is greatly distorted by the substrate reflection light. In this regard, the bottom anti-reflection coating (BARC) is effective to prevent the pattern distortion. The present authors focus on the resist pattern adhesion depending on the BARC materials. By the direct peeling method with atomic force microscope tip (DPAT) method, the adhesion property of line resist patterns on the BARC layers is measured quantitatively. It is clarified that the apex of line pattern is more likely to peel. Moreover, the resist pattern on the NCA4344 BARC indicates good adhesion as compared with that on ARC29A BARC. From these results, the NCA4344 should be one of the candidate materials as a suitable BARC material. Additionally, the DPAT method is effective for analyzing the adhesion and condensation properties of resist patterns quantitatively.},

Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates with pre-etched cavities provide freedom to MEMS design and enable manufacturing of advanced sensor structures (sensor structures that would be difficult or impossible with conventional substrates). Cavities with different shapes and sizes were etched on to the handle wafers. The etched handle wafers were bonded to unpatterned cap wafers in air or in vacuum. The bonding quality was evaluated with scanning acoustic microscopy and with HF-etching test. After bonding, the cap wafers were thinned down with grinding and polishing. The thickness variation of silicon diaphragm over the cavities was evaluated with cross-sectional SEM. The deflection of the Si film was measured with surface profilometry. To decrease the deflection and the thickness variation of the film, different support structures were placed inside the cavities.The bonding experiments carried out with patterned wafers showed that vacuum bonding results in slightly higher bonding energy than bonding in air. With large cavity fraction (80% of total wafer area), the air bonded samples had large void on the bonded interface. With smaller cavity fractions or with vacuum bonded samples, no such voids were found. Thinning studies showed that the thickness variation of the silicon diaphragm increases with increasing cavity dimensions and with decreasing SOI layer thickness. Thickness variation can be reduced with support structures under the Si membrane.},

Physico-chemical properties of smectite clays such as diffusivity of chemical species and adsorptivity on surface of clay mineral are characterized by crystalline structure of hydrated smectite minerals. To obtain the microscopic properties of the hydrated smectite, the molecular behavior is analyzed by a molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. We understand at least two types of adsorption are formed on the smectite surface; outer sphere complex and inner sphere complex. The inner sphere complex occurs on the edge sites of clay minerals. The amount of mono-layer of cations on the edge surface is considered as the adsorptivity of smectite in the microscopic level. A multiscale homogenization analysis (HA) is applied to extend the microscopic characteristics of the hydrated smectite to the macroscopic behavior. The diffusion and adsorption of a radioactive specie, cesium (Cs), is introduced by this analysis. The calculated results appear to be acceptable.},

abstract = {Miniaturized gas sensors or electronic noses to rapidly detect and differentiate trace amount of chemical agents are extremely attractive. In this paper, we report on the fabrication and characterization of a functional tin oxide nanoparticle gas sensor. Tin oxide nanoparticles are first synthesized using a convenient and low-cost mini-arc plasma source. The nanoparticle size distribution is measured online using a scanning electrical mobility spectrometer (SEMS). The product nanoparticles are analyzed ex-situ by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) for morphology and defects, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy for elemental composition, electron diffraction for crystal structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface composition. Nonagglomerated rutile tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles as small as a few nm have been produced. Larger particles bear a core-shell structure with a metallic core and an oxide shell. The nanoparticles are then assembled onto an e-beam lithographically patterned interdigitated electrode using electrostatic force to fabricate the gas sensor. The nanoparticle sensor exhibits a fast response and a good sensitivity when exposed to 100 ppm ethanol vapor in air.},

abstract = {This paper presents a shape-based approach in extracting thin structures, such as lines and sheets, from three-dimensional (3D) biomedical images. Of particular interest is the capability to recover cellular structures, such as microtubule spindle fibers and plasma membranes, from laser scanning confocal microscopic (LSCM) data. Hessian-based shape methods are reviewed. A synthesized linear structure is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the multiscale filtering approach in extracting closely positioned fibers. We find that the multiscale approach tends to fuse lines together, which makes it unsuitable for visualizing mouse egg spindle fibers. Single-scale Gaussian filters, balanced between sensitivity and noise resistance, are adopted instead. In addition, through an ellipsoidal Gaussian model, the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are quantitatively associated with the standard deviations of the Gaussian model. Existing shape filters are simplified and applied to LSCM data. A significant improvement in extracting closely positioned thin lines is demonstrated by the resultant images. Further, the direct association of shape models and eigenvalues makes the processed images more understandable qualitatively and quantitatively.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop an advanced diagnostic method for urinary bladder tumour grading. A novel soft computing modelling methodology based on the augmentation of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) with the unsupervised active Hebbian learning (AHL) algorithm is applied. Material and methods: One hundred and twenty-eight cases of urinary bladder cancer were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Histopathology, University Hospital of Patras, Greece. All tumours had been characterized according to the classical World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. To design the FCM model for tumour grading, three experts histopathologists defined the main histopathological features (concepts) and their impact on grade characterization. The resulted FCM model consisted of nine concepts. Eight concepts represented the main histopathological features for tumour grading. The ninth concept represented the tumour grade. To increase the classification ability of the FCM model, the AHL algorithm was applied to adjust the weights of the FCM. Results: The proposed FCM grading model achieved a classification accuracy of 72.5%, 74.42% and 95.55% for tumours of grades I, II and III, respectively. Conclusions: An advanced computerized method to support tumour grade diagnosis decision was proposed and developed. The novelty of the method is based on employing the soft computing method of FCMs to represent specialized knowledge on histopathology and on augmenting FCMs ability using an unsupervised learning algorithm, the AHL. The proposed method performs with reasonably high accuracy compared to other existing methods and at the same time meets the physicians' requirements for transparency and explicability.},

Therefore, the interface between metals and organic semiconductors deserves special attention. In situ Raman scattering was applied here to assess metal/organic interface formation. As model systems molecular layers of two perylene derivatives, viz. 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and N,N'-dimethyl 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic diimide (DiMe-PTCDI) were investigated. These layers were grown on S-GaAs(100) substrates by organic molecular beam deposition in ultra-high vacuum. Ag, In, and Mg were thermally evaporated onto the organic layers and the Raman spectra were recorded in situ. The results reveal that Ag and Mg form an abrupt interface while In strongly diffuses into the organic layers. Mg, on the other hand, undergoes strong chemical reaction with PTCDA. The experiments also benefit from a strong enhancement of the scattering intensity which is induced by the rough morphology of deposited metals. The enhancement factors as a function of nominal metal coverage and the subsequent attenuation at large metal coverages deliver valuable information on the metal morphology which is discussed in comparison to additional atomic force microscopy results.},

Although their spatial structures are known and abundant information on topology of binding to nAChR is obtained by labeling and mutagenesis studies, the accurate structure of the complex is not yet known. Here, we present a model for a short @a-neurotoxin, neurotoxin II from Naja oxiana (NTII), bound to Torpedo californica nAChR. It was built by comparative modeling, docking and molecular dynamics using ^1H NMR structure of NTII, cross-linking and mutagenesis data, cryoelectron microscopy structure of Torpedo marmorata nAChR [Unwin, N., 2005.

In complex with the receptor, NTII was located at about 30A from the membrane surface, the tip of its loop II plunges into the ligand-binding pocket between the @a/@c or @a/@d nAChR subunits, while the loops I and III contact nAChR by their tips only in a 'surface-touch' manner. The toxin structure undergoes some changes during the final complex formation (for 1.45rmsd in 15-25ps according to AMBER'99 molecular dynamics simulation), which correlates with NMR data. The data on the mobility and accessibility of spin- and fluorescence labels in free and bound NTII were used in MD simulations. The binding process is dependent on spontaneous outward movement of the C-loop earlier found in the AChBP complexes with @a-cobratoxin and @a-conotoxin. Among common features in binding of short- and long @a-neurotoxins is the rearrangement of aromatic residues in the binding pocket not observed for @a-conotoxin binding. Being in general very similar, the binding modes of short- and long @a-neurotoxins differ in the ways of loop II entry into nAChR.},

The scheme is simple to implement in three-dimensions. The results from our calculations show excellent agreement with two-dimensional microscopic solvability theory for pure material solidification. It is shown that the method predicts dendrite tip characteristics in excellent agreement with the theory.

Approximating the slow manifold, however, may be computationally as challenging as the original problem. If the system is defined by a legacy simulation code or a microscopic simulator, it may be impossible to perform the manipulations needed to directly approximate the slow manifold. In this paper we demonstrate that with the knowledge only of a set of “slow” variables that can be used to parameterize the slow manifold, we can conveniently compute, using a legacy simulator, on a nearby manifold. Forward and reverse integration, as well as the location of fixed points are illustrated for a discretization of the Chafee-Infante PDE for parameter values for which an Inertial Manifold is known to exist, and can be used to validate the computational results},

Previous work has demonstrated that automated classifiers can recognize the patterns of all major subcellular organelles and structures in fluorescence microscope images with high accuracy. However, since some proteins may be present in more than one organelle, this paper addresses a more difficult task: recognizing a pattern that is a mixture of two or more fundamental patterns. The approach utilizes an object-based image model, in which each image of a location pattern is represented by a set of objects of distinct, learned types. Using a two-stage approach in which object types are learned and then cell-level features are calculated based on the object types, the basic location patterns were well recognized. Given the object types, a multinomial mixture model was built to recognize mixture patterns. Under appropriate conditions, synthetic mixture patterns can be decomposed with over 80% accuracy, which, for the first time, shows that the problem of computationally decomposing subcellular patterns into fundamental organelle patterns can be solved.},

abstract = {Motivation:  Recent advances in confocal microscopy have allowed scientists to assess the expression, and to some extent, the interaction/colocalization of multiple molecules within cells and tissues. In some instances, accurately quantifying the colocalization of two or more proteins may be critical. This can require the acquisition of multiple Z plane images (Z stacks) throughout a specimen and, as such, we report here the successful development of a freeware, open-source image analysis tool, IMAJIN_COLOC, developed in PERL (v. 5.8, build 806), using the PERLMagick libraries (ImageMagick). Using a pixel-by-pixel analysis algorithm, IMAJIN_COLOC can analyze images for antigen expression (any number of colors) and can measure all possible combinations of colocalization for up to three colors by analyzing a Z stack gallery acquired for each sample. The simultaneous (i.e. in a single pass) analysis of three-color colocalization, and batch analysis capabilities are distinctive features of this program.  Results:  A control image, containing known individual and colocalized pixel counts, was used to validate the accuracy of IMAJIN_COLOC. As further validation, pixel counts and colocalization values from the control image were compared to those obtained with the software packaged with the Zeiss laser-scanning microscope (LSM AIM, version 3.2). The values from both programs were found to be identical. To demonstrate the applicability of this program in addressing novel biological questions, we examined the role of neurons in eliciting an immune reaction in response to viral infection. Specifically, we successfully examined expression of the chemokine RANTES in measles virus (MV) infected hippocampal neurons and quantified changes in RANTES production throughout the disease period. The resultant quantitative data were also evaluated visually, using a gif image created during the analysis.

abstract = {Nanostructures formed during submonolayer deposition of gold on clean c(8x2)InSb(001) surface in ultrahigh vacuum have been investigated with dynamic force microscopy (DFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). It is found that gold structures have predominantly the form of rectangular islands with edges oriented along &lt;110&gt; and &lt;1-10&gt; directions and their average size is dependent on the substrate temperature during evaporation. Upon annealing the initial rectangular shape of the islands is preserved but their average size is almost doubled. Furthermore, KPFM chemical imaging of the islands evidences that their composition is different from the composition of the homogeneous substrate. In addition, the change of the low energy electron diffraction pattern from c(8x2) to c(4x4) strongly suggests that the substrate surface between the islands has been converted from In-rich to Sb-rich, most likely due to alloying of the surface indium with gold in the islands.},

abstract = {Si(100) and (111) oriented silicon wafers were used as a substrate for metallic bilayers deposition of copper and gold. Cu/Au/Si structures were obtained by thermal evaporation and then heated below 400^oC in vacuum. These solid-state reactions occurred in the samples have been studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray dispersive energy analyzer (XDE). The study shows that heat treatment at 200^oC of the multilayered Cu/Au/Si structure leads to the formation and the co-existence of both Cu"3Si and Cu"4Si copper rich-silicides with the expansion of their respective cells, independently of the orientation of the substrate. The increasing of the annealing temperature until 400^oC leads to the growth of well-oriented crystallites corresponding to Cu"3Si and Cu"4Si silicides on Si(111) but only Cu"4Si crystallites with square and rectangular shapes on Si(100). The thermal stability of formed copper silicides after heat treatment at 400^oC during 30min for both Cu/Au/Si(100) and Cu/Au/Si(111) systems is analyzed.},

abstract = {Purpose: Glaucoma is a common ocular disease whose pathogenesis is hypothesized to involve biomechanical damage to optic nerve tissues. Here we describe a method for the construction of patient-specific models that can be used to evaluate the biomechanical environment within the optic nerve head. We validate the method using a virtual eye, and demonstrate its use in computing optic nerve head biomechanics. Methods: Human eyes were imaged and the optic nerve head region was processed to allow serial plastic histologic sections to be cut. These sections were photographed, unwarped and aligned so as to reconstruct three-dimensional patient-specific models incorporating sclera, pre- and post-laminar nerve, lamina cribrosa, and pia mater. Deformations, stresses and strains were computed in the resulting model using finite element techniques. Results: The approach successfully reconstructed patient-specific optic nerve head models. Reconstruction of a virtual eye showed excellent agreement between the true and reconstructed geometries, and between the deformations and strains computed on the true and reconstructed geometries. A sample reconstruction showed reasonable agreement between computed and measured retinal surface deformations. Conclusion: The technique presented here is viable and can be used to accurately compute human optic nerve head biomechanics.},

abstract = {Since 1985, we have been developing a scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) system for biomedical use and have been investigating the acoustic properties of various organs and disease states by using this SAM system. In biomedicine, SAM is useful for intraoperative pathological examination, study of low-frequency ultrasonic images, and assessment of biomechanics at a microscopic level. Recently, we have proposed a new concept -- acoustic microscopy -- using a single pulsed wave instead of continuous waves used in conventional SAM systems. In the present study, we compared two systems by measuring the same biological material. The sound speed image obtained by sound speed microscopy corresponded well to that obtained using a conventional SAM system. Lesions with hyaline degeneration showed a lower sound speed when compared with that of normal myocardium. Frequency domain analysis of amplitude and phase by both methods also showed similar characteristics. Although the data acquisition time of one frame was greater than that in conventional SAM, the total time required for calculation was significantly shorter. The SAM system can be applied to intraoperative pathological examination.},

The new segmentation scheme seeks the geodesic active contour of globally minimal energy under the sole restriction that it contains a specified internal point  p   int . This internal point selects the object of interest and may be used as the only input parameter to yield a highly automated segmentation scheme. The image to be segmented is represented as a Riemannian space  S  with an associated metric induced by the image. The metric is an isotropic and decreasing function of the local image gradient at each point in the image, encoding the local homogeneity of image features. Optimal segmentations are then the closed geodesics which partition the object from the background with minimal similarity across the partitioning. An efficient algorithm is presented for the computation of globally optimal segmentations and applied to cell microscopy, x-ray, magnetic resonance and cDNA microarray images.},

abstract = {Deep x-ray lithography in combination with electroforming is capable of producing high precision metal parts in small lot series. This study deals with a high aspect ratio structure with overall dimensions on the order of 10 mm 7 mm 1.5 mm, with the smallest line width being 150 μm. The lateral deviation from the design is to be kept to a minimum, preferably below 5 μm. To ensure adequate quality control, a semi-automated metrology technique has been established to measure all parts. While the paper will give a brief overview of all involved techniques, it focuses on the method to measure the top and bottom of the parts and the top of geometries following the process. The instrument used is a View Engineering Voyager V6 12 microscope, which is fully programmable. The microscope allows direct measurement of geometries but also is capable of saving all captured data as point clouds. These point clouds play a central role when evaluating part geometry. After measuring the part, the point cloud is compared to the computer aided design (CAD) contour of the part, using a commercially available software package. The challenge of proper edge lighting on a nickel alloy part is evaluated by varying lighting conditions systematically. Results of two conditions are presented along with a set of optimized parameters. With the introduced set of tools, process flow can be monitored by measuring geometries, e.g. linewidths in every step of the process line. An example for such analysis is given. After delivery of a large batch of parts, extensive numbers of datasets were available allowing the evaluation of the variation of part geometries. Discussed in detail is the deviation from part top to part bottom geometries indicating swelling of the PMMA mold in the electroplating bath.},

High resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements indicate that the thermo stability of LAO films in contact with silicon substrates is greatly affected by oxygen pressures, and thicker interfacial layer would be expected for LAO films deposited in high oxygen pressure. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) and leakage current measurements indicate that the effective oxide thickness, leakage current, flatband voltage and hysteresis loop characteristics are affected by the oxygen pressure during film fabrication. Larger EOT, lower leakage current and smaller hysteresis loop is expected to be obtained for LAO films deposited in higher oxygen pressure or lower vacuum. When oxygen pressure is below or equal to 0.1Pa, the absolute value of V"F"B increases with the decrease of oxygen pressure. When oxygen pressure is above 0.1Pa, the V"F"B value begins to decrease slowly.},

abstract = {In order to reduce the high cost of ownership and cost of consumables, we have collected the silica abrasive powders by filtering method after subsequent chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process for the recycling of abrasives. From this, we have studied the possibility of recycling reused silica abrasive through the analysis of particle size distribution and field emission scanning electron microscope measurements of abrasive powders. We annealed the collected abrasive powders to promote the mechanical strength of reduced abrasion force. Finally, we compared the CMP characteristics between self-developed KOH-based silica abrasive slurry and original slurry. Our experimental results show removal rate and planarity comparable to commercial products. Consequently, we can expect the saving of high cost slurry.},

abstract = {The edge roughness of lithographically defined resist features is an important aspect of the microfabrication of semiconductor devices. Previous work has demonstrated the dependence of the surface roughness of PMMA resist on developer composition and conditions; from which it was concluded that the origin of surface roughness was polymer phase separation during the development step. In this work, the same AFM microscopy technique is used to investigate edge roughness. For very steep edges, the AFM technique is unable to image the resist roughness close to the substrate due to shadowing by the higher parts of the resist. However, the change in dose at the feature edge can be lithographically controlled, which allows the edge roughness of steep features to be determined by extrapolation from AFM measurements on shallow exposure gradients. The effects of resist polymer re-deposition, due to phase separation at the rinse step, are clearly seen.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes with highly doped molded diamond tips have proven to increase the resolution of scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) measurements. There is consequently a need for probes with consistent characteristics. AFM probes with molded tips require the attachment of a holder piece for their manipulation. Because of the size of this holder piece, the probes are typically released from the backside of the substrate. We propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of topside release with a release after attachment of the holder piece. In this approach, the contact area between the holder piece and the substrate is reduced to a few bonding pads. The release chemical can then flow under the holder piece in between the pads. Since only the pads need to be underetched, the release time is greatly reduced.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to o study the evolution of postive HIV population for manifestation of AIDS, the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.For this purpose, we suggest a methodology to combine a macroscopic HIV positive population model with an individual microscopic model. The first describes the evolution of the population whereas the second the evolution of HIV in each individual of the population. This methodology is suggested by the way that experts use to conduct public policies namely, to act at the individual level to observe and verify the manifest population.The population model we address is a differential equation system whose transference rate from asymptomatic to symptomatic population is found through a fuzzy rule-based system. The transference rate depends on the CD4-level, the main T lymphocyte attacked by the HIV retrovirus when it reaches the bloodstream. The microscopic model for a characteristic individual in a population is used to obtain the CD4-level at each time instant. From the CD4 - level, its fuzzy initial value, and the macroscopic population model, we compute the fuzzy values of the proportion of asymptomatic population at each time instant t using the extension principle. Next, centroid defuzzification is used to obtain a solution that represents the number of infected individuals. This approach provides a method to find a solution of a non-autonomous differential equation from an autonomous equation, a fuzzy initial value, the extension principle, and center of gravity defuzzification. Simulation experiments show that the solution given by the method suggested in this paper fits well to AIDS population data reported in the literature.},

The operations do not have all the properties of classic erosion and dilation operations, in particular the properties of opening and closing. The metrological properties of the devised algorithm are presented, with an emphasis on measurement errors that result from the method used for the operation parameter selection.Sensitivity of the algorithm to additive noise of Gaussian distribution is studied, taking into special consideration the microscopic images obtained from the examination of biological cell structures. We also show the convergence of the devised algorithm and its sensitivity to the quality of image binarization.Some examples of segmentation of biological cell structure images obtained from implementations of the algorithm, both in the Matlab application with the Image Processing Toolbox and in Delphi, are shown.},

abstract = {This paper presented the fabrication and applications of an iron(III)-oxide nanoparticle/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cone as a component integrated in lab on a chip. The two main functions of this component were to capture magnetic microbeads in the microfluid and to mix two laminar fluids by generating disturbance. The iron(III)-oxide nanoparticle/PDMS cone was fabricated by automatic dispensing and magnetic shaping. Three consecutive cones of 300 µm in height were asymmetrically placed along a microchannel of 2 mm in width and 1.1 mm in height. Flow passing the cones was effectively redistributed for Renolds number lower than 3.45\texttimes{}10-3. Streptavidin-coated magnetic microbeads which were bound with biotin were successfully captured by the composite cones as inspected under fluorescence microscope. The process parameters for fabricating the composite cones were investigated. The fabricated cone in the microchannel could be applied in lab on a chip for bioassay in the future.},
