abstract = {Pathological image retrieval contributes to computer-aided diagnosis for breast cancer due to the fact that the retrieval results generally contain detailed diagnostic information (e.g. abnormal regions and diagnostic opinion from other doctors) which can offer some reference and assistance to the doctor during diagnosis process. In this paper, we present a novel pathological image retrieval approach based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) model. The method respectively utilizes SIFT features after visual saliency detection, and block Gabor features for the construction of two semantic codebooks, which not only can characterize the salient local invariant features and texture information under different scales and orientations in the pathological images, but also consider the high-level semantic features. Furthermore, we apply pLSA model to discover the latent topics in each codebook. Finally each pathological image is represented by the combination of topics from these two codebooks. The proposed method is evaluated on the pathological image database for breast cancer, which includes 5 categories (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, basal-like carcinoma, invasive breast cancer and low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma) and 110 cases for each category. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {Accurate classification on pathological images is a significant research focus such as for non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical classification model based on the labels' statistics for three NHL pathological images, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). First, each pathological image is converted onto the grayscale channel and then divided into 130 non-overlapped patches with 100100 pixels. Next, the sparse autoencoder (SAE), an unsupervised feature extraction method, is utilized to learn the representations of all patches and meanwhile texture features are extracted on these patches which are considered as the hand-craft features. Following this process, we can obtain a 680-dimension feature set. Finally, a hierarchical classification model trained by these 680-dimension features is applied to classify NHL as CLL, FL and MCL, where the label of each NHL pathological image is determined via the output labels of its 130 patches. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate the advantages of the proposed hierarchical classification model.},

abstract = {Pathological image analysis plays a significant role in effective disease diagnostics. Quantitative microscopy has supplemented clinicians with accurate results for diagnosis of dreaded diseases such as leukemia, hepatitis, AIDS, psoriasis. In this paper we present a texture based approach for automated leukemia detection. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease characterized by the accumulation of lymphoblast in the bone marrow. Texture features of the blood nucleus are investigated for diagnostic prediction of ALL. Other shape features are also extracted to classify a lymphocytic cell in the blood image into normal lymphocyte or lymphoblast (blasts). Initial segmentation is done using K-means clustering which segregates leukocytes or white blood cells (WBC) from other blood components i.e. erythrocytes and platelets. The results of K-means are used for evaluating individual cell shape, texture and other features for final detection of leukemia. A total of 108 blood smear images were considered for feature extraction and final performance evaluation is validated with the results of a hematologist.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address one very important industrial application of computer vision – automatic classification of materials. In our work, we have considered materials that are mixtures of two or more elements. Such materials are called alloys. It is observed at the microscopic level that an alloy is composed of small randomly distributed crystals of varying shapes and sizes called grains. Also, the color and hence the intensity of the grains vary in alloys. Generally, this shape-size-intensity distribution of the grains is different for different materials. This means micrographs obtained from different materials form texture-like images that differ from one material to another in appearance. Therefore, in principle, any texture analysis method may be used for material classification. In our method, we propose to extract textural features corresponding to grain geometry and intensity and use them for analysis and classification of alloys. These features are extracted via gray-scale morphological operations and are measured in terms of Size-Intensity-Diagram (SID) and Tri-variate Pattern Spectrum (TPS) coefficients. In our experiments, we achieved 83.43% and 89.43% classification accuracies in cases of SID and TPS, respectively. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for material classification which in turn confirms that our choice of features is indeed appropriate for the purpose.},

abstract = {The objective of semantic segmentation in microscopic images is to extract the cellular, nuclear or tissue components. This problem is challenging due to the large variations of these components features (size, shape, orientation or texture). In this paper we present an automatic technique to robustly identify the epithelial nuclei (crypt) against interstitial nuclei in microscopic images taken from colon tissues. The relationship between the histological structures (epithelial layer, lumen and stroma) and the ring like shape of the crypt are considered. The crypt inner boundary is detected using a closing morphological hierarchy and its associated binary hierarchy. The outer border is determined by the epithelial nuclei, overlapped by the maximal isoline of the inner boundary. The evaluation of the proposed method is made by computing the percentage of the mis-segmented nuclei against epithelial nuclei per crypt.},

Computational features such as shape, intensity, and texture were extracted from glandular areas. Segmented glandular areas of LCIS were significantly larger, thicker, lower and less variant in intensity, compared to normal areas (Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.01). Our models based on data mining algorithms detected LCIS frames at the accuracy rate close to 99%.

It also selects important features from each of the relevant descriptors, which can suitably describe significant characteristics of the virus particles present in TEM images. The hypercuboid equivalence partition matrix of rough sets is employed to evaluate the relevance of texture descriptors. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is used to categorize the virus samples into one of the known virus classes.

abstract = {In nano-medicine, mesoporous silicon particles provide efficient vehicles for the dissemination and delivery of key proteins at the micron scale. We propose a new quality-control method for the nanopore structure of these particles, based on image analysis software developed to automatically inspect scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images of nanoparticles in a fully automated fashion. Our algorithm first identifies the precise position and shape of each nanopore, then generates a graphic display of these nanopores and of their boundaries. This is essentially a texture segmentation task, and a key quality-control requirement is fast computing speed. Our software then computes key shape characteristics of individual nanopores, such as area, outer diameter, eccentricity, etc., and then generates means, standard deviations, and histograms of each pore-shape feature. Thus, the image analysis algorithms automatically produce a vector from each image which contains relevant nanoparticle quality control characteristics, either for comparison to pre-established acceptability thresholds, or for the analysis of homogeneity and the detection of outliers among families of nanoparticles.},

To reach a final diagnosis, usually the specialist relies on the analysis of characteristics easily observed, such as cells size, shape, staining and texture, but also depends on the hidden information of tissue localization, physiological and pathological mechanisms, clinical aspects, or other etiological agents. In this paper, Mathematical Morphology (MM) and Machine Learning (ML) methods were applied to characterize and classify histological images. MM techniques were employed for image analysis. The measurements obtained from image and graph analysis were fed into Machine Learning algorithms, which were designed and developed to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. Specifically, a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the used measures. The results show that the methodology was successful in characterizing and classifying the differences between the architectural organization of epithelial and adipose tissues. We believe that this approach can be also applied to classify and help the diagnosis of many tissue abnormalities, such as cancers.},

abstract = {The study of biology and population dynamics of fish species requires the estimation of fecundity parameters in individual fish in many fisheries laboratories. The traditional procedure used in fisheries research is to classify and count the oocytes manually on a subsample of known weight of the ovary, and to measure few oocytes under a binocular microscope. With an adequate interactive tool, this process might be done on a computer. However, in both cases the task is very time consuming, with the obvious consequence that fecundity studies are not conducted routinely. In this work we develop a computer vision system for the classification of oocytes using texture features in histological images. The system is structured in three stages: 1) extraction of the oocyte from the original image; 2) calculation of a texture feature vector for each oocyte; and 3) classification of the oocytes using this feature vector. A statistical evaluation of the proposed system is presented and discussed.},

abstract = {This study presents an image analysis framework coupled with machine learning algorithms for the classification of microscopy pollen grain images. Pollen grain classification has received notable attention concerning a wide range of applications such as paleontology and honey certification, forecasting of allergies caused of airborne pollen and food technology. It requires an extensive qualitative process that is mostly performed manually by an expert. Although manual classification shows satisfactory performance, it may suffer from intra and inter-observer variability and it is time consuming. This study benefits from the advances of image processing and machine learning and proposes a fully-automated analysis pipeline aiming to: A) calculate morphological characteristics from the images using a cost-effective microscope, and b) classify images into 6 pollen classes. A private dataset from the Department of Agriculture of the Hellenic Mediterranean University in Crete containing 564 images was used in this study. A Random Forest (RF) classifier was utilized to classify images. A repeated nested cross-validation (nested-CV) schema was used to estimate the generalization performance and prevent overfitting. Image preprocessing, extraction of geometric and textural characteristics and feature selection were implemented prior to the assessment of the classification performance and a mean accuracy of 88.24% was reported.},

abstract = {Biological images have the potential to reveal complex signatures that may not be amenable to morphological modeling in terms of shape, location, texture, and color. An effective analytical method is to characterize the composition of a specimen based on user-defined patterns of texture and contrast formation. However, such a simple requirement demands an improved model for stability and robustness. Here, an interactive computational model is introduced for learning patterns of interest by example. The learned patterns bound an active contour model in which the traditional gradient descent optimization is replaced by the more efficient optimization of the graph cut methods. First, the energy function is defined according to the curve evolution. Next, a graph is constructed with weighted edges on the energy function and is optimized with the graph cut algorithm. As a result, the method combines the advantages of the level set method and graph cut algorithm, i.e., "topological" invariance and computational efficiency. The technique is extended to the multiphase segmentation problem; the method is validated on synthetic images and then applied to specimens imaged by transmission electron microscopy(TEM).},

abstract = {Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) is a noninvasive imaging tool used in clinical dermatology and skin research, allowing real time visualization of skin structural features at different depths at a resolution comparable to that of conventional histology [1]. Currently, RCM is used to generate a rich skin image stack (about 60 to 100 images per scan) which is visually inspected by experts, a process that is tedious, time consuming and exclusively qualitative. Based on the observation that each of the skin images in the stack can be characterized as a texture, we propose a quantitative approach for automatically classifying the images in the RCM stack, as belonging to the different skin layers: stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, stratum basale, and the papillary dermis. A reduced set of images in the stack are used to generate a library of representative texture features named textons. This library is employed to characterize all the images in the stack with a corresponding texton histogram. The stack is ultimately separated into 5 different sets of images, each corresponding to different skin layers, exhibiting good correlation with expert grading. The performance of the method is tested against three RCM stacks and we generate promising classification results. The proposed method is especially valuable considering the currently scarce landscape of quantitative solutions for RCM imaging.},

We compare and combine 5 different types of local texture descriptors and show that by combining the different types a lower classification error is achieved.

In contrast, a multiresolution wavelet packet analysis can decompose the input signal into a set of frequency subbands giving the opportunity to characterise the texture at the appropriate frequency channel. An adaptive best bases algorithm for optimal bases selection for meningioma histopathological images is proposed, via applying the fractal dimension (FD) as the bases selection criterion in a tree-structured manner. Thereby, the most significant subband that better identifies texture discontinuities will only be chosen for further decomposition, and its fractal signature would represent the extracted feature vector for classification. The best basis selection using the FD outperformed the energy based selection approaches, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.25% as compared to 83.44% and 73.75% for the cooccurrence matrix and energy texture signatures; respectively.},

abstract = {The article deals with the design of a method for the automatic detection of static objects in the image captured by an optical microscope. The search algorithm for static objects in the image - non-moving cilia is based on texture description methods. The texture of the image is described by statistical values, where it can be noticed that background texture, cells and cilia have different mathematical statistical parameters. Just based on the different statistical parameters of the textures, the classification for each texture parameter was done separately. As a result, the resulting classification considers the most predominant group to which the pixel has been assigned. In the end, the obtained mask was adjusted by morphological operations to obtain the boundary of the area, where the algorithm automatically evaluated that one was about Cilia. This work is supported by medical specialists from Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in Martin (Slovakia) and proposed tools would fill the gap in the diagnostics in the field of respirology in Slovakia.},

abstract = {There is a great deal of interest in developing automated histological grading of tissue biopsies. Current approaches involve sophisticated algorithms for image segmentation, tissue architecture characterization, global texture feature extraction, and high-dimensional clustering and classification algorithms. Although overall image classification accuracy is measured, there has been very little attention paid to the quantitative assessment of the image segmentation stage (glandular structure characterization stage) to provide feedback to the segmentation process. We describe a robust approach for tissue segmentation combining spatial clustering with multiphase vector level set active contours to extract nuclei, lumen and epithelial cytoplasm. Quantitative segmentation performance compared to manual ground truth is assessed using region-based geometric criteria.},

The proposed framework utilized both local and topological features from histopathology images. To extract local features, a robust cell detection and segmentation method is first adopted to segment each individual cell in images. Then a set of extensive local features is extracted using efficient geometry and texture descriptors based on cell detection results. To investigate the effectiveness of topological features, we calculated architectural properties from labeled nuclei centroids. Experimental results from four popular classifiers suggest that the cellular structure is very important and the topological descriptors are representative markers to distinguish between two subtypes of NSCLC.},

abstract = {The common occurrence and transportability of quartz sand grains make them useful for forensic analysis, providing that grains can be accurately and consistently designated into prespecified types. Recent advances in the analysis of surface texture features found in scanning electron microscopy images of such grains have advanced this process. However, this requires expert knowledge that is not only time intensive, but also rare, meaning that automation is a highly attractive prospect if it were possible to achieve good levels of performance. Basic Image Feature Columns (BIF Columns), which use local symmetry type to produce a highly invariant yet distinctive encoding, have shown leading performance in standard texture recognition tasks used in computer vision. However, the system has not previously been tested on a real world problem. Here we demonstrate that the BIF Column system offers a simple yet effective solution to grain classification using surface texture. In a two class problem, where human level performance is expected to be perfect, the system classifies all but one grain from a sample of 88 correctly. In a harder task, where expert human performance is expected to be significantly less than perfect, our system achieves a correct classification rate of over 80%, with clear indications that performance can be improved if a larger dataset were available. Furthermore, very little tuning or adaptation has been necessary to achieve these results giving cause for optimism in the general applicability of this system to other texture classification problems in forensic analysis.},

The presence of clusters of fine, granular microcalcifications in mammographic images can be a primary sign of breast cancer. The malignancy of any cluster of microcalcification cannot be reliably determined by radiologists from mammographic images and need to be assessed through histology images. In this paper, a novel method of mammographic microcalcification classification is described using the local topological structure of microcalcifications. Unlike the statistical and texture features of microcalcifications, the proposed method focuses on the number of microcalcifications in local clusters, the distance between them, and the number of clusters. The initial evaluation on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) database shows promising results with 86% accuracy and findings which are in line with clinical perception of benign and malignant morphological appearance of microcalcification clusters.},

abstract = {Materials, such as snow, sand, metallic paints, rough plastics, and metals, often exhibit small-scale phenomena observed as bright sparkling or glittering surface features. These features become more pronounced under narrow-angle illumination and vary based on the orientation of the surface with respect to the viewer and light sources. Microfacet-based surface models, composed of a large finite number of microscopic mirror-like flakes, can mimic this effect. An associated microfacet BRDF and a memory-efficient stochastic algorithm are explored in [Jakob et al. 2014]. We present a new stochastic algorithm that inherits the good properties of the original algorithm, but does not require any precomputation; implements optimal importance sampling which is extended to efficiently sample wide and heavy-tailed microfacet distributions (i.e. GGX), and offers better overall performance. In addition, a triplanar mapping technique is employed to handle geometry without texture coordinates. The algorithm is both practical and easier to implement.},

After the sputum samples are stained, images are taken at multiple frequencies 650nm and 660nm. We extracted four different sets of features (shape based, intensity based, wavelet based and Gabor filter based features). Both wavelet based and Gabor based features capture the texture properties of cell. Using these features we built different machine learning models. We obtained an accuracy of 96% using initial set of 35 features (shape based, intensity based and wavelet based features).

abstract = {Human faces manifest distinct structures and characteristics when observed in different scales. Traditional face recognition techniques mainly rely on low-resolution face images, leading to the lost of significant information contained in the microscopic traits. In this paper, we introduce a multilayer framework for high resolution face recognition exploiting features in multiple scales. Each face image is factorized into four layers: global appearance, facial organs, skins, and irregular details. We employ Multilevel PCA followed by Regularized LDA to model global appearance and facial organs. However, the description of skin texture and irregular details, for which conventional vector representation are not suitable, brings forth the need of developing novel representations. To address the issue, Discriminative Multiscale Texton Features and SIFT-Activated Pictorial Structure are proposed to describe skin and subtle details respectively. To effectively combine the information conveyed by all layers, we further design an metric fusion algorithm adaptively placing emphasis onto the highly confident layers. Through systematic experiments, we identify different roles played by the layers and convincingly show that by utilizing their complementarities, our framework achieves remarkable performance improvement.},

In this paper, we propose a method for the segmentation of urine sediment image using the magnification of 20-fold microscopy based on Markov model. This method selects sum average feature derived from the spatial gray co-occurrence matrix for the classification in the neighborhood window with the size of 7\texttimes{}7. First, each pixel in the image is evaluated by its intensity dispersion in comparison with the average intensity of the 7\texttimes{}7 neighborhood, and the pixels with higher dispersion would be further proceeded by Gaussian mixture model. Here the weights are designed feature distance matrix within the window to obtain similar, so as to re-estimate the features. Edge positioning is more accurate and clear compared with the traditional morphological methods by using the method of texture segmentation about urinary sediment image in this paper which can make it avoids cell adhesion caused by too closer proximity of cells and there is no glitch in the target area.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised texture segmentation that relies on a very general nonparametric statistical model of image neighborhoods. The method models image neighborhoods directly, without the construction of intermediate features. It does not rely on using specific descriptors that work for certain kinds of textures, but is rather based on a more generic approach that tries to adaptively capture the core properties of textures. It exploits the fundamental description of textures as images derived from stationary random fields and models the associated higher-order statistics nonparametrically. This general formulation enables the method to easily adapt to various kinds of textures. The method minimizes an entropy-based metric on the probability density functions of image neighborhoods to give an optimal segmentation. The entropy minimization drives a very fast level-set scheme that uses threshold dynamics, which allows for a very rapid evolution towards the optimal segmentation during the initial iterations. The method does not rely on a training stage and, hence, is unsupervised. It automatically tunes its important internal parameters based on the information content of the data. The method generalizes in a straightforward manner from the two-region case to an arbitrary number of regions and incorporates an efficient multi-phase level-set framework. This paper presents numerous results, for both the two-texture and multiple-texture cases, using synthetic and real images that include electron-microscopy images.},

Nevertheless, the resolution disparity between gigapixel images and megapixel displays presents a challenge to effective visual analysis because subtle texture differences are hardly perceivable at coarser resolutions. In this paper, we present a hierarchical segmentation technique based on the joint distribution of intensity and noise-resistant local binary patterns to differentiate subtle microstructural textures across various scales. The coarse-to-fine segmentation procedure subdivides each parent segment into texturally-distinct child segments at progressively higher resolutions. The hierarchical structure of segments allows creating intermediate segmentation results interactively. Based on the intermediate results, we highlight regions with texture differences using distinct colors, which provide salient visual hints to users despite the current viewing resolution. Our new technique has been validated on large microscopy images and shows promising results.},

In this study, we present a robust and objective automatic classification system for real time classification of AC and SC based on morphological tissue pattern of H&amp;E images alone to assist medical experts in diagnosis of lung cancer. Various original and extended Densitometric and Haralick's texture features are used to extract image features, and a Boosting algorithm is utilized to train the classifier, together with alternative decision tree as the base learner. For evaluation, 369 tissue samples were collected in tissue microarray format, including 97 adenocarcinoma and 272 squamous carcinoma samples. Using 10-fold cross validation, the technique achieved high accuracy of 92.41%, and we also found that the two Boosting algorithms (cw-Boost and AdaBoost.M1) perform consistently well in comparison with other popularly adopted machine learning methods, including support vector machine, neural network, single decision tree and alternative decision tree. This approach offers a robust, objective and rapid procedure for optimized patient-targeted therapies.},

abstract = {The extraction of nuclei from Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained biopsies present a particularly steep challenge in part due to the irregularity of the high-grade (most malignant) tumors. To your best knowledge, although some existing solutions perform adequately with relatively predictable low-grade cancers, solutions for the problematic high-grade cancers have yet to be proposed. In this paper, we propose a method for the extraction of cell nuclei from H&amp;E stained biopsies robust enough to deal with the full range of histological grades observed in daily clinical practice. The robustness is achieved by combining a wide range of information including color, texture, scale and geometry in a multi-stage, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based framework to replace the original image with a new, probabilistic image modality with stable characteristics. The actual extraction of the nuclei is performed from the new image using Mark Point Processes (MPP), a state-of-the-art stochastic method. An empirical evaluation on clinical data provided and annotated by pathologists shows that our method greatly improves detection and extraction results, and provides a reliable solution with high grade cancers. Moreover, our method based on machine learning can easily adapt to specific clinical conditions. In many respects, our method contributes to bridging the gap between the computer vision technologies and their actual clinical use for breast cancer grading.},

abstract = {The local spatial arrangement of nuclei in histopathology image has been shown to have prognostic value in the context of different cancers. In order to capture the nuclear architectural information locally, local cell cluster graph based measurements have been proposed. However, conventional ways of cell graph construction only utilize nuclear spatial proximity, and do not differentiate different cell types while constructing a cell graph. In this paper, we present feature driven local cell graph (FeDeG), a new approach to constructing local cell graphs by simultaneously considering spatial proximity and attributes of the individual nuclei (e.g. shape, size, texture). In addition, we designed a new set of quantitative graph derived metrics to be extracted from FeDeGs, in turn capturing the interplay between different local cell clusters. We evaluated the efficacy of FeDeG features in a digitized H&amp;E stained tissue micro-array (TMA) images cohort consists of 434 early stage non-small cell lung cancer for predicting short-term (&lt;5 years) vs long-term (&gt;5 years) survival. Across a 100 runs of 10-fold cross-validation, a linear discriminant classifier in conjunction with the 15 most predictive FeDeG features identified via the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (WRST) yielded an average of AUC = 0.68. By comparison, four state-of-the-art pathomic and a deep learning based classifier had a corresponding AUC of 0.56, 0.54, 0.61, 0.62, and 0.55 respectively.},

abstract = {Current diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma is done by manual analysis of biopsy tissue samples for tumor presence. However, the recent advent of whole slide digital scanners has made histopathological tissue specimens amenable to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). In this paper, we present a CAD system to assist pathologists by automatically detecting prostate cancer from digitized images of prostate histological specimens. Automated diagnosis on very large high resolution images is done via a multi-resolution scheme similar to the manner in which a pathologist isolates regions of interest on a glass slide. Nearly 600 image texture features are extracted and used to perform pixel-wise Bayesian classification at each image scale to obtain corresponding likelihood scenes. Starting at the lowest scale, we apply the AdaBoost algorithm to combine the most discriminating features, and we analyze only pixels with a high combined probability of malignancy at subsequent higher scales. The system was evaluated on 22 studies by comparing the CAD result to a pathologist’s manual segmentation of cancer (which served as ground truth) and found to have an overall accuracy of 88%. Our results show that (1) CAD detection sensitivity remains consistently high across image scales while CAD specificity increases with higher scales, (2) the method is robust to choice of training samples, and (3) the multi-scale cascaded approach results in significant savings in computational time.},

Squamous epithelium is initially segmented at a low resolution of 2X magnification. The boundaries of segmented Squamous epithelium are further fine tuned at the highest resolution of 40X magnification. Robust texture feature vectors were developed in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to do classification. Finally medical histology rules are applied to remove misclassifications.

Firstly, 20 pieces of microscopic images of human virus are obtained by using GLCM, and then the four texture feature parameters, entropy, energy, inertia moment and correlation are extracted utilizing the GLCM, and then HV image recognition is carried out. The experimental results show that the GLCM and extraction of image texture features can effectively identify the HV image, which can bring significance to the modern recognition and identification of HV.},

The proposed approach is based on both microscopic and macroscopic information which can effectively capture fundamental intensity properties of image textures. The combined information is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We extract the information at the microscopic level by using the frequency histogram of all pattern labels. At the macroscopic level, we extract the information by employing the circular Gabor filters at different center frequencies and computing the Tsallis entropy of the filter outputs. The proposed approach is robust in terms of histogram equalization since the feature is, by definition, invariant against flattening of pixel intensities. The good performance of this approach is proven by the promising experimental results obtained. We also evaluate our method based on six widely used image features. It is experimentally shown that our features exceed the performance obtained using other image features.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel algorithm for computer-assisted classification of cervical cancers using digitized histology images of biopsies. Texture analysis of the nuclei structure is very important for classification of cervical cancer histology. In this paper we present a two-tier classification strategy using Gabor filter banks for local classification and abnormality spread for global taxonomy. The test data used in this work are digitized histology images of cervical biopsies acquired from the pathology laboratories in the Saiful An war Hospital in Indonesia. The images from over 500 subjects are categorized by the pathologists into five grades, benign, pre-cancer (CIN1, CIN2, CIN3) and malignant. In the algorithm developed in this work, a texture classification method using Gabor filter banks is implemented to segment the image into five possible regions: of background, normal, abnormal, basal and stroma cells. The global classification algorithm uses the segmented image for the final prognosis of the degree of malignancies from benign to malignant. The process of texture segmentation using the Gabor filter bank involves the application of filters for several spatial frequencies and orientations. The Gabor filter bank is applied to cervical histology images with six frequencies and four orientations. Feature vectors are formed, comprising the response of each pixel and its neighboring pixels to each filter. The feature vectors are then used to classify each pixel and its immediate neighbor pixels into five categories. Based on the spread of abnormalities on the epithelium layer, the cervical histology image is then classified. The classification results are then used to further classify the image into: 1) normal, 2) pre-cancer and 3) malignant. The pre-cancer is divided into: a) CIN 1, b) CIN 2 and c) CIN 3. The final system will take as input a biopsy image of the cervix containing the epithelium layer and provide the classification using our new approach, to assist the pathologist in cervical cancer diagnosis.},

abstract = {The CellOrganizer project (http://cellorganizer.org) provides open source tools for learning generative models of cell organization directly from images and for synthesizing cell images (or other representations) from one or more of those models. Model learning captures variation among cells in a collection of images. Images used for model learning and instances synthesized from models can be two- or three-dimensional static images or movies. Current components of CellOrganizer can learn models of cell shape, nuclear shape, chromatin texture, vesicular organe lie number, size, shape and position, and microtubule distribution. These models can be conditional upon each other: for example, for a given synthesized cell instance, organelle position will be dependent upon the cell and nuclear shape ofthat instance. The models can be parametric, in which a choice is made about an explicit form to represent a particular structure, or non-parametric, in which distributions are learned empirically. One of the main uses of the system is in support of cell simulations: models learned from separate experiments can be combined into one or more synthetic cell instances that are output in a form compatible with cell simulation engines such as MCell, Virtual Cell and Smoldyn. Another important application of the system is in comparison of target patterns and perturbagen effects in high content screening and analysis. This is currently done using numerical features, but these are difficult to compare across different microscope systems or cell types since features can be affected by changes in more than one aspect of cell organization. More robust comparisons can be made using generative model parameters, since these can distinguish effects on cell size or shape from effects on organelle pattern. Ultimately, it is anticipated that collaborative efforts by many groups will enable creation of image-derived generative models that permit accurate modeling of cell behaviors, and that can be used to drive experimentation to improve them through active learning.},

Our analysis shows that the multi scale extension performs better than the standard local binary patterns and that radial density profiles in comparison is a rather poor virus texture discriminating measure. Furthermore, we show that the multi scale extension and the profiles in Fourier domain are both good texture measures and that they complement each other well, that is, they seem to detect different texture properties. Combining the two, hence, improves the discrimination between virus textures.},

abstract = {Traditionally, colon cancer is diagnosed using microscopic analysis of histopathological colon samples. The manual examination of tissue specimens is not only time consuming, but is also subjective, and depends upon a few factors such as experience and work-load of the histopathologist. Therefore, research community is constantly putting efforts in developing automated colon cancer diagnostic systems, which can provide reliable second opinion to the histopathologists. Colon biopsy image based classification is one of such computer-aided diagnostic technique that can help in quantifying the differences in the structure of normal and malignant colon tissues without needing the subjective involvement of histopathologists. In this work, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic technique that models the differences in the regular organization of normal colon tissues and irregular structure of malignant colon tissues in terms of a few features such as least square distances, elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) and morphological features. These features are extracted from each colon biopsy image, and are given as input to classifier. An ensemble of SVM kernels, based on majority voting, has been developed for classification of samples into normal and malignant classes. Features are also combined to develop an information rich hybrid feature vector, which is also used for the classification. The proposed method has been tested on a colon biopsy image based dataset, and performance has been observed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC), and Kappa statistics. It has been observed that each feature type performs reasonably well. Further, ensemble classifier and the hybrid feature vector have shown better performance compared to individual features and the individual classifiers, respectively.},

abstract = {Morphology of anatomical structures can provide important diagnostic information regarding disease. Implicit features of morphology, such as contour smoothness or perimeter-to-area ratio, have been used in the context of computerized decision support classifiers to aid disease diagnosis. These features are usually specific to the domain and application (e.g. margin irregularity is a predictor of malignant breast lesions on DCE-MRI). In this paper we present a framework for extracting Diffeomorphic Based Similarity (DBS) features to capture subtle morphometric differences between shapes that may not be captured by implicit features. Object morphology is represented using the medial axis model and objects are compared by determining correspondences between medial axis models using a cluster-based diffeomorphic registration scheme. To visualize and classify morphometric differences, a manifold learning scheme (Graph Embedding) is employed to identify nonlinear dependencies between medial axis model similarity and calculate DBS. We evaluated our DBS on two clinical problems discriminating: (a) different Gleason grades of prostate cancer using gland morphology on a set of 102 images, and (b) benign and malignant lesions on 44 breast DCE-MRI studies. Precision-recall curves demonstrate DBS features are better able to classify shapes belonging to the same class compared to implicit features. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes utilizing DBS. SVM accuracy was 83 ± 4.47% for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions on breast DCE-MRI and over 80% in distinguishing between intermediate Gleason grades of prostate cancer on digitized histology.},

abstract = {For the analysis of learning processes and the underlying changes of the shape of excitatory synapses (spines), 3-D volume samples of selected dendritic segments are scanned by a confocal laser scanning microscope. The images are unsharp because of the (direction dependent) resolution limit. A deconvolution on image data is not sufficient for the resolution needed. Therefore a parametric model is used to reconstruct the dendrite and the spines. The parameter estimation of model is done in a two step approach. First, rough center axes of dendrite and spines are found by a growing model which can be adjusted interactively. In a second step the model parameters are optimized during an iterative process. To estimate the deviation between the microscope image and the model, the model is sampled with the same resolution as the microscope image and convolved by the microscope point spread function (psf). The result is a accurate model of dendrite and spines. The model fitting process is comparable with a deconvolution but with a limited number of model parameters and stable results without strong distortions by PSF. The associated presynaptic terminal can be detected in a second image channel inside a region of interest (roi) on spine position. Morphological features of spines from geometrical model and from second channel roi are combined for statistical analysis.},

abstract = {3-D volume samples of selected dendritic segments are scanned by a confocal laser-scanning microscope to investigate the impact of alterations in the shape of dendritic spines for their synaptic functioning. Double-labeling techniques using green fluorescent protein-labeled neurons and synaptophysin-labeled presynaptic terminals allow us to capture images of dendrites and spines in one image channel and the presynaptic boutons in a second image channel. To detect spines and to reconstruct spine shape a parametric model is fitted in the noisy confocal image. Starting with the geometrical model of the spine head, voxels in the second image channel are labeled by a distance map to detect possible associated presynaptic terminals. This method enables a flexible visualization of geometrical models of spines and dendrites together with selected presynapses and an adjustable, distance-dependent quantification of boutons. These functional features are combined with morphological features from the geometrical model for every spine and establish a basis for advanced statistical analysis of the underlying learning processes in brain. The cellular events of changes in spine morphology can be studied in relation to functional properties.},

Further, the method compensates the presence of fixed-pattern noise and used a deconvolution filter to reduce blurring. The method is implemented on a built-in mid-wave infrared microscopy imaging system. The results show a significant reduction in the imaging nonuniformity and blur, achieving better digital resolution identifying more details of the different scene object thermal patterns.},

Histopathological imaging of prostate tissue samples provides the gold standard for obtaining the Gleason score, but the manual assignment of Gleason grades is a labor-intensive and error-prone process. We have developed a texture classification system for automatic and reproducible Gleason grading. Our system characterizes the texture in images belonging to a tumor grade by clustering extracted filter responses at each pixel into textons (basic texture elements). We have used random forests to cluster the filter responses into textons followed by the spatial pyramid match kernel in conjunction with an SVM classifier. We have demonstrated the efficacy of our system in distinguishing between Gleason grades 3 and 4.},

The reflection image on a transparent plate is a complex image that consists of a reflection on the surface and on the rear surface of the plate. A displacement between the two reflection images holds the range information to the object, which can be extracted from a single complex image. The displacement in the complex image depends not only on the object range but also on the normal vectors of the plate surfaces, plate thickness, relative refraction index, and the plate position. These parameters can be estimated using multiple planar targets with random texture at known distances. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect microscopic surface shape differences between two different commercially available transparent acrylic plates.},

abstract = {Motivated by the current limitations of automated quantitative image analysis in discriminating among intracellular immunohistochemical (IHC) staining patterns, this paper presents a two-fold approach for IHC characterization that utilizes both the protein stain information and the surrounding tissue architecture. Through the use of a color unmixing algorithm, stained tissue sections are automatically decomposed into the IHC stain, which visualizes the target protein, and the counterstain which provides an objective indication of the underlying histologic architecture. Feature measures are subsequently extracted from both staining planes. In order to characterize the IHC expression pattern, this approach exploits the use of a non-traditional feature based on textons. Novel biologically motivated filter banks are introduced in order to derive texture signatures for different IHC staining patterns. Systematic experiments using this approach were used to classify breast cancer tissue microarrays which had been previously prepared using immuno-targeted nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membrane stains.},

abstract = {Detection of Clostridioides difficile cells in scanning electron microscopy images is a challenging task due to the challenges of cell rotation and inhomogeneous illumination. Currently, orientation-invariance in deep ConvNets is achieved by data augmentation. However, training with all possible orientations increases computational complexity. Furthermore, conventional illumination-invariance models include pre-processing illumination normalization steps. However, illumination normalization algorithms remove important texture information which is critical for the analysis of SEM images. In this paper, RISEC (Rotational Invariant Segmentation of Elongated Cells in SEM images with Inhomogeneous Illumination) is proposed to address the challenges of cell rotation and inhomogeneous illumination. First, a generative adversarial network segments the candidate cell regions proposals, addressing the inhomogeneous illumination. Then, the region proposals are passed to two capsule layers where a rotation-invariant shape representation is learned for every cell type via dynamic routing. Our experiments indicate that RISEC outperforms the state of the art models (e.g., CapsNet, and U-net) by at least 11% improving the dice score.},

abstract = {Skin analysis has potential uses in many fields, including computer assisted diagnosis for dermatology, topical drug efficacy testing for the pharmaceutical industry, and quantitative product comparison for cosmetics. In medicine, skin pores are the openings of hair follicles, oil glands, and sweat glands. There are many skin problems associated with skin pores, such as blackheads which are not dirt and cannot be washed away, enlarged pores which are due to over activity of the sebaceous glands in the skin. In computer-aided skin analysis, skin pores are helpful features for skin image registration, skin texture modeling, and skin statement evaluation. In this paper we mainly focus on image-based skin pores detection problem and propose an integrated solution based on fuzzy c-mean algorithm. In our work, research images include images taking by digital camera with long focus lens and images taking by microscope. A global luminance proportion method will be used for skin image preprocessing because of reflection and interreflection of light on the skin surface. We provide experiments to demonstrate the effective and efficiency of our solution.},

This creates an opportunity to understand the screening patterns of expert pathologists and extract the patterns that lead to accurate and efficient diagnoses. For this purpose, we are taking the first step to interpret the recorded actions of world-class expert pathologists on a set of digitized breast biopsy images. We propose an algorithm to extract regions of interest from the logs of image screenings using zoom levels, time and the magnitude of panning motion. Using diagnostically relevant regions marked by experts, we use the visual bag-of-words model with texture and color features to describe these regions and train probabilistic classifiers to predict similar regions of interest in new whole slide images. The proposed algorithm gives promising results for detecting diagnostically relevant regions. We hope this attempt to predict the regions that attract pathologists' attention will provide the first step in a more comprehensive study to understand the diagnostic patterns in histopathology.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Confocal reflectance microscopy is an emerging modality, for dermatology applications, especially for in-situ and bedside detection of skin cancers. As this technology gains acceptance, automated processing methods become increasingly important to develop. Since the dominant internal feature of the skin is the epidermis/dermis boundary, it has been chosen as the initial target for this development. This boundary is a complex corrugated 3D layer marked by optically subtle changes and features. Indeed, even trained clinicians in an attempt at validation of our early work, were unable to precisely and reliably locate the boundary within optical resolution. Thus here we propose to detect two boundaries, a lower boundary for the epidermis and an upper boundary for the dermis thus trapping the epidermis/dermis boundary. We use a novel combined segmentation/classification approach applied to z-sequences of tiles in the 3D stack. The approach employs a sequential classification on texture features, selected via on-line feature selection, to minimize the labeling required and to cope with high inter- and intra-subject variability and low optical contrast. Initial results indicate the ability of our approach to find these two boundaries successfully for most of the z-sequences from the stack.},

Digitized microscopy views of the specimens were used in the IAS's design. IAS comprised a/image segmentation, for nuclei determination, b/extraction of textural features, by processing of nuclei-images utilizing the Laws and Gabor filters and by calculating textural features from the processed nuclei-images, and c/PNN and SVM classifiers design, for discriminating positively stained nuclei. The proportion of the latter in each case's images was compared against the physician's score. Using Spearman's rank correlation, high correlation was found between the histo-pathogist's and IAS's scores (rho=0.89, p&lt;0.001) and 22/24 cases were correctly characterised, indicating IAS's reliability in the quantitative evaluation of ER as additional assistance to physician's assessment.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a method for optical paper surface roughness measurement, which overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional methods. Airflow-based roughness measurement methods and profilometer require expensive special equipment, essential laboratory conditions, are contact-based and slow and unsuitable for on-line control purposes methods. We employed an optical microscope with a built-in CCD-camera to take images of paper surface. The obtained image is considered as a texture. We applied statistical brightness measures and fractal dimension analysis for texture analysis. We have found a strong correlation between the roughness and a fractal dimension. Our method is non-contact–based, fast and is suitable for on-line control measurements in the paper industry.},

abstract = {Analysis of cells and tissues allow the evaluation and diagnosis of a vast number of diseases. Nowadays this analysis is still performed manually, involving numerous drawbacks, in particular the results accuracy heavily depends on the operator skills. Differently, the automated analysis by computer is performed quickly, requires only one image of the sample and provides precise results. In this work we investigate different texture descriptors extracted from colour medical images. We compare and combine these features in order to identify the features set able to properly classify medical images presenting different classification problems. The tested feature sets are based on a generalization of some existent grey scale approaches for feature extraction to colour images. The generalization has been applied to the calculation of Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix, Grey-Level Difference Matrix and Grey-Level Run-Length Matrix. Furthermore, we calculate Grey-Level Run-Length Matrix starting from the Grey-Level Difference Matrix. The resulting feature sets performances have been compared using the Support Vector Machine model. To validate our method we have used three different databases, HistologyDS, Pap-smear and Lymphoma, that present different medical problems and so they represent different classification problems. The obtained experimental results have showed that the features extracted from the generalized Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix perform better than the other set of features, demonstrating also that a combination of features selected from all the feature subsets leads always to better performances.},

abstract = {The microscopic analysis of the urinary sediment is important in making diagnoses for a variety of diseases, including urinary tract infection, urinary tract tumors, occult glomerulonephritis, and interstitial nephritis. A typical automated system acquires images of urinary sediment by employing a CCD camera, and then detects and recognizes the distinct particles automatically from these images. Automated recognition of these particles represents a significant challenge due to poor image resolution, strong variability of particle shape and size, and challenges associated with detection of particles in the presence of noisy backgrounds. In this paper, we present a novel method for urine particle classification based on the use of local descriptors coupled with regression based decision fusion. Specifically, DAISY descriptors have been used to capture the textural characteristics of each particle and subjected to dimensionality reduction across three linear subspaces to increase the diversity in decision making along with lowering the "curse of dimensionality". Classification in each subspace is based on computing a similarity score, which is then fused through support vector regression to obtain a final classification. The approach is applied to both brightfield and multispectral data to ascertain the benefits of multispectral imaging for urine analysis. Urine particles analyzed included crystals, casts and blood cells, and the results obtained show an average classification accuracy of 92.6% for 6 classes of urinary particles.},

abstract = {A new approach for the segmentation of gland units in histological images is proposed with the aim of contributing to the improvement of the prostate cancer diagnosis. Clustering methods on several colour spaces are applied to each sample in order to generate a binary mask of the different tissue components. From the mask of lumen candidates, the Locally Constrained Watershed Transform (LCWT) is applied as a novel gland segmentation technique never before used in this type of images. 500 random gland candidates, both benign and pathological, are selected to evaluate the LCWT technique providing results of Dice coefficient of 0.85. Several shape and textural descriptors in combination with contextual features and a fractal analysis are applied, in a novel way, on different colour spaces achieving a total of 297 features to discern between artefacts and true glands. The most relevant features are then selected by an exhaustive statistical analysis in terms of independence between variables and dependence with the class. 3.200 artefacts, 3.195 benign glands and 3.000 pathological glands are obtained, from a data set of 1.468 images at 10x magnification. A careful strategy of data partition is implemented to robustly address the classification problem between artefacts and glands. Both linear and non-linear approaches are considered using machine learning techniques based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and feedforward neural networks achieving values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.92, 0.97 and 0.95, respectively.},

abstract = {Autoimmune diseases are proven to be connected with the occurrence of autoantibodies in patient serum. Antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) identification can be accomplished in a laboratory using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) imaging. ANAs are characterized by specific “visual” patterns on a humane epithelial cell line (HEp-2). The identification stage is usually done by trained and highly qualified physicians through visual inspection of slides using a fluorescence microscope. The presence of subjectivity in the identification process, the interobserver variability, the increasing demand of highly specialized personnel, suggest that a realization of an automatic classification system is of great significance for the field of autoimmune diseases diagnosis. Moreover CAD systems can be used in a collaborative scheme in order to augment the physicians' capabilities. In this paper a system for automatic classification of staining patterns on single-cell fluorescence images is proposed. Our method utilizes morphological features extracted from a set of binary images derived via multi-level thresholding of fluorescence images. Furthermore, a modified version of Uniform Local Binary Patterns descriptor is incorporated in order to capture local textural information. The classification is performed using a non-linear SVM Classifier. The proposed method is evaluated using a publicly available dataset, recently released for the purposes of HEP-2 Cells classification competition at ICPR 2012, achieving up to 95.9% overall classification accuracy.},

In addition to the conventional surface roughness parameters like Ra, Rz JIS and Rz DIN, parameters derived from the material ratio curve and honing angle are used for the functional performance prediction and quality control of cylinder liners. This work presents a method for the description and evaluation of the surface topography of cylinder liner surfaces using machine vision. Images of the cylinder liner surfaces manufactured with different roughness values are captured using a charge coupled device (CCD) camera attached with a miniature microscopic probe in a nondestructive manner. The captured images of the cylinder liners are pre-processed to evaluate image based texture parameters based on the statistical properties of the image intensity histograms and box counting fractal method. The developed image based texture parameters are compared and correlated with stylus based roughness parameters. The internal surface image capturing method, the image processing procedure and the results are presented and analyzed in this paper.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a fast and accurate approach for the identification and quantification of the hepatic fibrosis from liver biopsies using Bayesian tissue classification methods. The approach is based on the pixel level color information, but also on the local texture information in 8\texttimes{}8 pixel neighborhoods, making thus use of the already available information in the microscopic images at hand by considering their representation in the JPEG format. Thus, the image storage format itself provides the information needed for an accurate identification/segmentation of the hepatic biopsies into tissue vs. microscopic slide and further, of the tissue into healthy tissue vs. hepatic fibrosis. The experimental results of the proposed method prove not only a good accuracy but also a fast classification, done to the expense of the transform domain data, which makes it sufficiently to perform a block classification rather than a pixel-level classification. Whereas complicating to some extent the training phase, the classification (test) phase is significantly faster. Also the accuracy provided by the implicit use of texture information is superior to the one based by pixel-level color info alone.},

abstract = {Paper forgery is among the leading causes of corruption in many developing regions. In this paper, we introduce PaperSpeckle, a robust system that leverages the natural randomness property present in paper to generate a fingerprint for any piece of paper. Our goal in developing PaperSpeckle is to build a low-cost paper based authentication mechanism for applications in rural regions such as microfinance, healthcare, land ownership records, supply chain services and education which heavily rely on paper based records. Unlike prior paper fingerprinting techniques that have extracted fingerprints based on the fiber structure of paper, PaperSpeckle uses the texture speckle pattern, a random bright/dark region formation at the microscopic level when light falls on to the paper, to extract a unique fingerprint to identify paper. In PaperSpeckle, we show how to extract a "repeatable" texture speckle pattern of a microscopic region of a paper using low-cost machinery involving paper, pen and a cheap microscope. Using extensive testing on different types of paper, we show that PaperSpeckle can produce a robust repeatable fingerprint even if paper is damaged due to crumpling, printing or scribbling, soaking in water or aging with time.},

abstract = {Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has complex molecular structure stimulated by certain chromatin architectural changes which are not easy to be detected by the naked eye. Prediction of OSCC can be done through various clinical and histological factors. As the OSCC treatment is dependent on histological grading the recent focus is to discover the morphological changes studied by computer-assisted image analysis. One of such more specific diagnostic and prognostic factor is the analysis of the fractal geometry. Fractal Dimension (FD) is the analysis and quantification of the degree of complexity of the fractal objects. FD provides a way to precisely analyse the architecture of natural objects. The purpose of this research is to estimate Minkowski fractal dimension of histopathological images for early detection of oral cancer. The proposed model is developed for analysis medical images to estimate Minkowski fractal dimension using a box-counting algorithm that allows windowing of images for more accurate calculation in the suspected areas of oral cancerous growth.},

Then, fractional derivatives are introduced into extracting the strength of cell edges that is utilized to design a new cell-edge indicator for driving the closed curve to cell edges. Finally, we incorporate the automatic initialization and the stopper function into a level set method to evolve the curve and finally realize cell segmentation. The comparison with the state-of-the-art methods shows that our method could improve the segmentation performance on adhesive cells with blur edges, and it does not need to tune too many parameters.},

abstract = {The accurate identification of the tumour tissue border is of crucial importance for histopathology image analysis. However, due to the high morphology variance in histology images, especially in border regions where cancer tissue interfere into the normal region, it is challenging even for the pathologists to define the border, not to say for the machine. In this paper, we present an innovative framework to semantically segment the tumour border area in colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) on pixel level by integrating the features from deep convolutional networks with spatial and statistical information of the cells. With annotations from the pathologists, a two-level deep neural network including a cell-level model and a tissue-level model, is trained to classify patches from the whole slide scan image. Based on the prediction of trained models, a growing-style algorithm is proposed to finalize the segmentation by leveraging the statistical and spatial properties of the cells. Evaluated against the ground truth created by the experts, the framework demonstrates a significant improvement over a conventional deep network model on the cell-level model or the tissue model alone.},

A major challenge for more robust segmentation and classification methods is the large variations in the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells, combining with the low image quality caused by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, in this work we propose a learning-based, simultaneous cell segmentation and classification method based on the U-Net structure with deformable convolution layers. The U-Net architecture has been shown to offer a precise localization for image semantic segmentation. Moreover, deformable convolution enables the free form deformation of the feature learning process, thus making the whole network more robust to various cell morphologies and image settings. The proposed method is tested on microscopic red blood cell images from patients with sickle cell disease. The results show that U-Net with deformable convolution achieves the highest accuracy for both segmentation and classification tasks, compared with the original U-Net structure and unsupervised methods.},

abstract = {Dendritic cells play a fundamental role in the immune system. The analysis of these cells in vitro is a new evaluation technique of the effects of food contaminants on the immune responses. This analysis that remains purely visual is a laborious and time-consuming process. An automatic analysis of dendritic cells is suggested to analyze their morphological features and behavior. It can serve as an assessment tool for dendritic cells image analysis to facilitate the evaluation of toxic impact. The suggested method will help biological experts to avoid subjective analysis and to save time. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for segmentation of dendritic cells that could assist pathologists in their evaluation. First, after a preprocessing step, we use k-means clustering and mathematical morphology to detect the location of cells in microscopic images. Second, a region-based Chan-Vese active contour model is applied to get boundaries of the detected cells. Finally, a post processing stage based on shape information is used to improve the results in case of over-segmentation or sub-segmentation in order to select only regions of interest. A segmentation accuracy of 99.44% on a real dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its suitability for automated identification of dendritic cells.},

In the field of biomedical imaging, for the purposes of visualization and/or quantification, different stains are typically used for different targets of interest (e.g., cellular/subcellular events), which generates multi-spectrum data (images) through various types of microscopes and, as a result, provides the possibility of learning biological-component-specific features by exploiting multispectral information. We propose a multispectral feature learning model that automatically learns a set of convolution filter banks from separate spectra to efficiently discover the intrinsic tissue morphometric signatures, based on convolutional sparse coding (CSC). The learned feature representations are then aggregated through the spatial pyramid matching framework (SPM) and finally classified using a linear SVM. The proposed system has been evaluated using two large-scale tumor cohorts, collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Experimental results show that the proposed model 1) outperforms systems utilizing sparse coding for unsupervised feature learning (e.g., PSDSPM [5]), 2) is competitive with systems built upon features with biological prior knowledge (e.g., SMLSPM [4]).},

abstract = {Colon cancer diagnosis based on microscopic analysis of biopsy sample is a common medical practice. However, the process is subjective, biased and leads to interobserver variability. Further, histopathologists have to analyze many biopsy samples per day. Therefore, factors such as tiredness, experience and workload of histopathologists also affect the diagnosis. These shortcomings require a supporting system, which can help the histopathologists in accurately determining cancer. Image segmentation is one of the techniques, which can help in efficiently segregating colon biopsy image into constituent regions, and accurately localizing the cancer. In this work, we propose a novel colon biopsy image segmentation technique, wherein segmentation has been posed as a classification problem. Local binary patterns (LTP), local ternary patters (LTP), and Haralick features are extracted for each pixel of colon biopsy images. Features are reduced using genetic algorithms and F-Score. Reduced features are given as input to random forest, rotation forest, and rotation boost classifiers for segregation of image into normal, malignant and connecting tissues components. The clustering performance has been evaluated using segmentation accuracy and Davies bouldin index (DBI). Performance of classifiers has also been evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC). It is observed that rotation boost in combination with F-Score has shown better results in segmenting the images compared to other classifiers.},

Recent advancement in microscopy imaging of the structure of cell organelles enables biomedical researchers to study cell morphology in great detail to discover the pathogeneses of diseases by information obtained at molecular level. A particular interest is to quantify the complexity of the spatial content of the intracellular space captured by the combination of focused ion beam (FIB) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging systems. Such quantitative measure of the complexity of organelles is expected to be a useful tool for benchmarking biological simulations of cancers and controlling disease-specific drug effects. In this paper, for the first time nonlinear dynamical models are utilized to investigate the structural characteristics of intracellular space using FIB-SEM technology to quantify the complex architecture of cell organelles.},

abstract = {High-throughput microscopy imaging applications represent an important research field that is focused on testing and comparing lots of different conditions in living systems. It runs over a limited time-frame and per time step images are generated as output; within the time-range a resilient variation in the images of the experiment is characteristic. Studies represent dynamic circumstances expressed in shape variation of the objects under study. For object extraction, i.e. the segmentation of cells, aforementioned conditions have to be taken into account. Segmentation is used to extract objects from images and from objects features are measured. For high-throughput applications generic segmentation algorithms tend to be suboptimal. Therefore, an algorithm is required that can adapt to a range of variations; i.e. self-adaptation of the segmentation parameters without prior knowledge. In order to prevent measurement bias, the algorithm should be able to assess all inconclusive configurations, e.g. cell clusters. The segmentation method must be accurate and robust so that results that can be trustfully used in further analysis and interpretation. For this study a number of algorithms were evaluated and from the results a new algorithm was developed; the watershed masked clustering algorithm. It consists of three steps: (1) a watershed algorithm is used to establish the coarse location of objects, (2) the threshold is optimized by applying a clustering in each watershed region and (3) each mask is reevaluated on consistency and re-optimized so as to result in consistent segmented objects. The evaluation of our algorithm is realized by testing with images containing artificial objects and real-life microscopy images. The result shows that our algorithm is significantly more accurate, more robust and very reproducible.},

abstract = {Color nonstandardness -- the propensity for similar objects to exhibit different color properties across images -- poses a significant problem in the computerized analysis of histopathology. Though many papers propose means for improving color constancy, the vast majority assume image formation via reflective light instead of light transmission as in microscopy, and thus are inappropriate for histological analysis. Previously, we presented a novel Bayesian color segmentation algorithm for histological images that is highly robust to color nonstandardness; this algorithm employed the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to dynamically estimate -- for each individual image -- the probability density functions that describe the colors of salient objects. However, our approach, like most EM-based algorithms, ignored important spatial constraints, such as those modeled by Markov random field (MRFs). Addressing this deficiency, we now present spatially-constrained EM (SCEM), a novel approach for incorporating Markov priors into the EM framework. With respect to our segmentation system, we replace EM with SCEM and then assess its improved ability to segment nuclei in H&amp;E stained histopathology. Segmentation performance is evaluated over seven (nearly) identical sections of gastrointestinal tissue stained using different protocols (simulating severe color nonstandardness). Over this dataset, our system identifies nuclear regions with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.838. If we disregard spatial constraints, the AUC drops to 0.748.},

abstract = {Shape based active contours have emerged as a natural solution to overlap resolution. However, most of these shape-based methods are computationally expensive. There are instances in an image where no overlapping objects are present and applying these schemes results in significant computational overhead without any accompanying, additional benefit. In this paper we present a novel adaptive active contour scheme (AdACM) that combines boundary and region based energy terms with a shape prior in a multi level set formulation. To reduce the computational overhead, the shape prior term in the variational formulation is only invoked for those instances in the image where overlaps between objects are identified; these overlaps being identified via a contour concavity detection scheme. By not having to invoke all 3 terms (shape, boundary, region) for segmenting every object in the scene, the computational expense of the integrated active contour model is dramatically reduced, a particularly relevant consideration when multiple objects have to be segmented on very large histopathological images. The AdACM was employed for the task of segmenting nuclei on 80 prostate cancer tissue microarray images. Morphological features extracted from these segmentations were found to able to discriminate different Gleason grade patterns with a classification accuracy of 84% via a Support Vector Machine classifier. On average the AdACM model provided 100% savings in computational times compared to a non-optimized hybrid AC model involving a shape prior.},

abstract = {In neurobiology, morphological change of neuronal structures such as dendrites and spines is important for understanding of brain functions or neuro-degenerative diseases. Especially, morphological changes of branching patterns of dendrites and volumetric spine structure is related to cognitive functions such as experienced-based learning, attention, and memory. To quantify their morphologies, we use confocal microscopy images which enables us to observe cellular structure with high resolution and three-dimensionally. However, the image resolution and field of view of microscopy is inversely proportional to the field of view (FOV) we cannot capture the whole structure of dendrite at on image. Therefore we combine partially obtained several images into a large image using image stitching techniques. To fine the overlapping region of adjacent images we use Fourier transform based phase correlation method. Then, we applied intensity blending algorithm to remove uneven intensity distribution and seam artifact at image boundaries which is coming from optical characteristics of microscopy. Finally, based on the integrated image we measure the morphology of dendrites from the center of cell to end of each branch. And geometrical characteristics of spine such as area, location, perimeter, and roundness, etc. are also quantified. Proposed method is fully automatic and provides accurate analysis of both local and global structural variations of neuron.},

Furthermore, using our framework, we can rank different algorithms, as well as define each algorithm's parameters.

The obtained structure information of the micro objects is important for the following 3d visual calculation process. Although PS method can extract and match features successfully by evaluating the appearance and shape under slightly varying illumination, while the microscopic images are taken under considerable varying illumination, appearance description of traditional PS model performs poor for our application. In this paper, self-similarity descriptors were used for features extracting and appearance describing for images of micro objects under large changed illumination. The special local features on the micro objects ensure the feasibility of self-similarity method. In the proposed method, the self-similarity descriptors of patches which reflect the information of local object structure are extracted. At the same time, the geometric relationship among patches is modeled by PS. By using our Similarity-Pictorial Structure method (combination of local self-similarity descriptors and pictorial structure model), the structure of object can be extracted and matched exactly. Finally, contrast experiments between PS method and our method for structure extracting and matching on object structure in microscopic images of MEMS components under large changed illumination are presented. Experiment results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {It is estimated that in 2010 more than 220 million people will be affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Early evidence indicates that specific markers for alpha and beta cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans can be used for early T2DM diagnosis. Currently, the analysis of such histological tissues is manually performed by trained pathologists using a light microscope. To objectify classification results and to reduce the processing time of histological tissues, an automated computational pathology framework for segmentation of pancreatic islets from histopathological fluorescence images is proposed. Due to high variability in the staining intensities for alpha and beta cells, classical medical imaging approaches fail in this scenario.The main contribution of this paper consists of a novel graph-based segmentation approach based on cell nuclei detection with randomized tree ensembles. The algorithm is trained via a cross validation scheme on a ground truth set of islet images manually segmented by 4 expert pathologists. Test errors obtained from the cross validation procedure demonstrate that the graph-based computational pathology analysis proposed is performing competitively to the expert pathologists while outperforming a baseline morphological approach.},

This paper proposes a new cell segmentation method for cancer cell migration studies using phase-contrast images. Instead of segmenting cells directly based on commonly used low-level features, e.g. intensity and gradient, we first identify the leading protrusions, a high level feature, of cancer cells. Based on the identified cell leading protrusions, we introduce a front vector flow guided active contour, which guides the initial cell boundaries to the real boundaries. The experimental validation on a set of breast cancer cell images shows that the proposed method demonstrates fast, stable, and accurate segmentation for breast cancer cells with wide range of sizes and shapes.},

abstract = {Accurate morphological characterization of the multiple neuronal classes of the brain would facilitate the elucidation of brain function and the functional changes that underlie neurological disorders such as Parkinson's diseases or Schizophrenia. Manual morphological analysis is very time-consuming and suffers from a lack of accuracy because some cell characteristics are not readily quantified. This paper presents an investigation in automating the classification of dopaminergic neurons located in the brainstem of the rodent, a region critical to the regulation of motor behaviour and is implicated in multiple neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease. Using a Carl Zeiss Axioimager Z1 microscope with Apotome, salient information was obtained from images of dopaminergic neurons using a structural feature extraction technique. A data set of 100 images of neurons was generated and a set of 17 features was used to describe their morphology. In order to identify differences between neurons, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional image representations were analyzed. This paper compares the performance of three popular classification methods in bioimage classification (Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNNs) and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR)), and the results show a significant difference between machine classification (with 97% accuracy) and human expert based classification (72% accuracy).},

abstract = {The integration manufacturing technology is a kind of compound precision finishing process that combined grinding with abrasive jet finishing, in which inject slurry of abrasive and liquid solvent to grinding zone between grinding wheel and work surface under no radial feed condition when workpiece grinding were accomplished. The abrasive particles are driven and energized by the rotating grinding wheel and liquid hydrodynamic pressure and increased slurry speed between grinding wheel and work surface to achieve micro removal machining. In the paper, the machining process validity was verified by experimental investigation and theoretical analysis. Experiments were performed with plane grinder M7120 and workpiece material 40Cr steel which was ground with the surface roughness mean values of Ra=0.6µm. The machined surface morphology was studied using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and metallography microscope and microcosmic geometry parameters were measured with TALYSURF5 instrument. The surface topographical characteristics were evaluated with correlation of random process about machined surface before and after finishing. The Results show that longitudinal geometry parameter values of finishing machining surface were diminished comparing with ground surface, and the mean ripple distance was decreased and, ripple and peak density were increased. Furthermore, The finished surface has little comparability compared to grinding machining surface. The isotropy surface and uniformity veins at parallel and perpendicular machining direction were attained by abrasive jet precision finishing with grinding wheel as restraint.},

Shape, intensity, and convex-hull features were extracted. Cell types were classified by several logistic regression formulas with 93.9% accuracy in average. The increased % mitotic cells were detected in 47 out of 571 transfected genes. Twenty genes showed more than two-fold increase in % mitotic cells confirmed by manual inspection. Among these, nine genes showed increased tissue expression levels in several tumors, thus, indicating their possible oncogenic roles.

Also, morphological features of stomata of tomato cultivars had not been studied before for the present purpose. In this article, we report results of our recent study of morphological features of stomata of different tomato cultivars based on their Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images.

Nuclear and chromatin images were segmented by top hat operations and touching nuclei were further separated by erosion, labeling, and conditional dilation. Shape and intensity features were extracted from nuclear and chromatin images to produce discriminant functions by logistic regression. Nuclear objects were classified as isolated and touching with 91.7% accuracy. Apoptotic and mitotic nuclei were identified with 88.8% accuracy.

abstract = {The diagnostics of oncological diseases is based on histological specimens in hematoxilin-eosin staining. Since manual evaluation of microscopy images is time consuming and depends on the human expert, several approaches to automatic image analysis and classification have been published. In such systems, feature extraction usually relies on a fixed resolution and a small number of numerical features. Contrarily, this framework is based on a morphometric study using two levels of optical magnification (50 and 200 times, correspondingly). In this paper, we propose a principle scheme for automation of the oncological diagnostics, and an algorithm of morphometric feature extraction of tissue fragment at low magnification. In particular, patterns of cells, vessels, and fragments of tissue are considered individually and combined for correct identification of objects extracted from the specimen. The fact of invasion is established automatically after this procedure as well as polymorphism, polychromism and anaplasia. Using this method, diagnostics of 86 out of 100 patients was confirmed.},

Our goal is to align sub-volumes by estimating an optimal global image transformation which preserves morphological smoothness of medical structures (called features, e.g., blood vessels) inside of a reconstructed 3D volume. We approached the problem by learning morphological characteristics of structures inside of each sub-volume, i.e. centroid trajectories of features. Next, adjacent sub-volumes are aligned by fusing the morphological characteristics of structures using extrapolation or model fitting. Finally, a global sub-volume to subvolume transformation is computed based on the entire set of fused structures. The trajectory-based 3D volume reconstruction method described here is evaluated with a pair of consecutive physical sections using two evaluation metrics for morphological continu},

abstract = {Cell-based fluorescence imaging assays are heterogeneous requiring collection of a large number of images for detailed quantitative analysis. Complexities arise as a result of variation in spatial nonuniformity, shape, overlapping compartments, and scale. A new technique and methodology has been developed and tested for delineating subcellular morphology and partitioning overlapping compartments at multiple scales. This system is packaged as an integrated software platform for quantifying images that are obtained through fluorescence microscopy. Proposed methods are model-based, leveraging geometric shape properties of subcellular compartments and corresponding protein localization. From the morphological perspective, convexity constraint is imposed to delineate, partition, and group nuclear compartments. From the protein localization perspective, radial symmetry is imposed to localize punctate protein events at sub-micron resolution. The technique has been tested against 196 images that were generated to study centrosome abnormalities. Computed representations are evaluated against the ground truth annotation for comparative analysis.},

While standard protocols for imaging immunostained actin are well established, assessment of the resulting microscopy images is most of the time still performed manually and with a high degree of subjectivity. In this paper, we present a new approach for the analysis of actin structures in microscopy images and the quantification of differences and similarities in actin organization between cells. Compared to existing methods, our approach does not require any previous knowledge about the cells or structures to be analyzed. It works in an unsupervised fashion, combining statistical texture measures and clustering techniques. By this, our method yields large flexibility and allows for application in a wide range of experimental scenarios, and also to heterogeneous cell populations. Experimental evaluation on sample data proves that our method yields meaningful results for biomedical investigations.},

abstract = {Presented paper deals with processing of electron-microscope images of Picea Abies stomas. A stoma character strongly depends on the level of air pollution in the area where the tree grows - as the stoma epidermis covers with epiticular waxes to protect itself against the negative environmental influences. According to the level of incrustation it is possible to distinguish five classes of stoma structure. An automatic algorithm recognizing a degree of stoma damage, based on the microscopic image processing can be useful during the process of environmental assessment. This work is devoted to a solution of the problem of stoma evaluation by means of texture classification. There are two principles discussed in the paper: The first principle is based on gradient methods while the second one uses a wavelet transform. Possibilities of application of mentioned attitudes were investigated and the classification criteria distinguishing the stoma character were suggested, as well. The resulting algorithm was verified on a library of four hundred real images and achieved results were compared with an expert's sensual classification. Selected methods of image preprocessing as noise reduction, brightness correction and resampling were used as well.},

Several studies propose the application of digital image processing techniques and Neural Networks to automate this task. This study uses simpler and more scalable machine learning techniques, being nearest neighbor and decision tree, and adds new optical properties to be extracted from the digital images. Two datasets are used, one provided by Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, with 17 different minerals, and another built from scratch in the geology department of Federal University of Pelotas, containing 4 different minerals. The datasets are composed of mineral images captured under cross and plane polarized light from different rock thin sections. For each dataset used, we took a pair of images of the same mineral taken on different lights, extracted optical properties of color and texture, applied a machine learning algorithm and provided the results. At the end of this study, we demonstrate it is possible to achieve high accuracy as Neural Networks with more simple machine learning algorithms as the our dataset showed average results as high as 97% and Mashhad’s as high as 93%.},

abstract = {Image segmentation is the first step in image analysis and pattern recognition, and it is one of the most difficult tasks in image processing, and determines the quality of the final result of analysis. Image segmentation requires the improvement because most image segmentation solution is problem based. Biomedical image segmentation is different than normal image segmentation. Because normal image is taken from camera which is free of noise. While biomedical image is taken from MRI, CT, Microscopic Instrument or X-ray which is it noisy and fuzzy. Medical image segmentation methods generally have restrictions because medical images have very similar gray level and texture among the interested. While extracting region of interest in biomedical image, region of interest can avoid the processing of irrelevant image point. Biomedical Image segmentation is necessary when we want the computer to make decision, surgical planning and robotically assisted surgical invention. Biomedical image segmentation is nothing but the classification of similar pixel and their following extraction into separate segment. There are different methods to do the Biomedical image segmentation but they are slow. he method which is described in this paper is fast and efficient. This paper gives comparative research of different method of each of category. The method described in the paper is for fast biomedical image segmentation},

abstract = {Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM) is a technique employed in a variety of settings, from museums to in-the-field image capture to multi-illuminant microscopy. It consists of illuminating the surface in question with lights from a collection of light directions, each light in turn. To date, the most accurate interpolation employed in PTM consists of two stages: a matte regression stage followed by a further specularity/shadow interpolation. For the first stage, recovering an underlying matte model so as to acquire surface albedo, normals and chromaticity, PTM employs polynomial regression at each pixel, mapping light-direction to luminance. A more accurate model excludes outlier values deriving from specularities and shadows by employing a robust regression from 6-D polynomials to 1-D luminance. Robust methods are guaranteed to automatically find the best representation of the underlying matte content. Here, we retain the idea of using robust methods but instead investigate using a much simpler robust 1-D mode-finder, acting on luminance and on chromaticity components. We then go on to increase accuracy by carrying out 3-D to 1-D regression: this strikes a balance between the best method and the fastest method, with greatly diminished complexity and another large speedup. We show that little accuracy is lost using this much simpler method, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method on several image datasets.},

For such data, the existing state-of-the-art computer vision methods perform poorly in segmenting specific cell type. Low SNR, clutter and occlusions are basic challenges for blind segmentation approaches. In this study we propose an automated method, based on a learning framework, for detecting particular cell type in cluttered 2D phase contrast images of 3D cell cultures that overcomes those challenges. It depends on local features defined over super pixels. The method learns appearance based features, statistical features, textural features and their combinations. Also, the importance of each feature is measured by employing Random Forest classifier. Experiments show that our approach does not depend on training data and the parameters.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose an image-based approach for in-vivo assessment of IVUS images. The method discriminates plaque components into four classes: calcium, necrotic core, fibrous and fibro-fatty. We employ the IVUS frames characterized by virtual histology (VH) for tissue labeling. As a result, we avoid the demerits of visual assessments of observers while at the same time the longitudinal resolution of VH is increased. To describe the textural properties of the tissue classes five different features are extracted from IVUS images. The features are computed by using multiple window sizes so that their values are adapted to the varying heterogeneity of the local patterns. In the next stage, we apply an effective feature selection algorithm on the combined feature space of original features, yielding a small subset of discriminating and non-redundant features. The retained features are used for tissue classification via an SVM classifier. The method is validated against the available VH reference data. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of 81%. This result is obtained by a reduced subset comprising 34 features of the appropriate type and scale of extraction.},

In this paper, we focus on binary blends, and seek to elucidate the role of blending on specific carbon fiber textures.

abstract = {The segmentation of tissue regions in high-resolution microscopy is a challenging problem due to both the size and appearance of digitized pathology sections. The two point correlation function (TPCF) has proved to be an effective feature to address the textural appearance of tissues. However the calculation of the TPCF functions is computationally burdensome and often intractable in the gigapixel images produced by slide scanning devices for pathology application. In this paper we present several approaches for accelerating deterministic calculation of point correlation functions using theory to reduce computation, parallelization on distributed systems, and parallelization on graphics processors. Previously we show that the correlation updating method of calculation offers an 8-35x speedup over frequency domain methods and decouples efficient computation from the select scales of Fourier methods. In this paper, using distributed computation on 64 compute nodes provides a further 42x speedup. Finally, parallelization on graphics processors (GPU) results in an additional 11-16x speedup using an implementation capable of running on a single desktop machine.},

In this paper, we propose a new SFF method that can provide rich structure information given limited number of observations. We observe that depth is non-linearly related to the observations and pose the shape estimation as a minimization problem within a Maximum A Posteriori MAP - Markov Random Field MRF framework. We incorporate a discontinuity-adaptive MRF prior for the underlying structure. The resulting cost function is non-convex in nature which we minimize using Graduated non-convexity algorithm. When tested on synthetic as well as real objects, the results obtained are quite impressive.},

abstract = {Many scientific computing applications generate streams where message sizes exceed one megabyte, in contrast with smaller message sizes in enterprise contexts (order kilobytes, often XML or JSON). Furthermore, the processing cost of messages in scientific computing applications are usually an order of magnitude higher than in typical enterprise applications. Frameworks such as Apache Spark offer high throughput processing of streams with such ‘enterprise’ characteristics, as well as scalability, with high resilience and many other desirable features. Motivated by the development of near real-time image processing pipelines for roboticized microscopy, we evaluate the suitability of Apache Spark for streams more typical of scientific computing applications, those with large message sizes (up&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;MB), and heavy per-message CPU load, under typical stream integrations. For comparison, we benchmark a P2P stream processing framework, HarmonicIO, developed in-house. Our study reveals a complex interplay of performance trade-offs, revealing the boundaries of good performance for each framework and integration over a wide domain of application loads. Based on these results, we suggest which are likely to offer good performance for a given load. Broadly, the advantages of Spark’s rich features makes its performance sensitive to message size in particular, whereas the simplicity of HarmonicIO offers more robust performance, and better CPU utilization.},

In this work, we investigated the multiscale and multidimensional fractal geometry with colour channels and colour models for classification of lymphoma tissue images. The fractal features were extracted from the RGB and LAB models and colour channels. The fractal features were concatenated to form the feature vector. Finally, we employed the Hermite polynomial classifier in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The colour channels obtained of histological images achieved higher accuracy values, the obtained rates were between 94% and 97%. These results are relevant, especially when we consider the difficulties of clinical practice in distinguishing the lesion in lymphoma images.},

The simulation results showed that the stress distribution was in a dynamic change process during elliptical vibration turning. Compared with conventional cutting, EVT technology can increase the shear angle, and the chip formed in the EVT process was thinner and had larger bending degree.

abstract = {Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provides information about Inorganic nanoparticles that no other method is able to deliver. Yet, a major task when studying Inorganic nanoparticles using TEM is the automated analysis of the images, i.e. segmentation of individual nanoparticles. The current state-of-the-art methods generally rely on binarization routines that require parameterization, and on methods to segment the overlapping nanoparticles (NPs) using highly idealized nanoparticle shape models. It is unclear, however, that there is any way to determine the best set of parameters providing an optimal segmentation, given the great diversity of NPs characteristics, such as shape and size, that may be encountered. Towards remedying these barriers, this paper introduces a method for segmentation of NPs in Bright Field (BF) TEM images. The proposed method involves three main steps: binarization, contour evidence extraction, and contour estimation. For the binarization, a model based on the U-Net architecture is trained to convert an input image into its binarized version. The contour evidence extraction starts by recovering contour segments from a binarized image using concave contour points detection. The contour segments which belong to the same nanoparticle are grouped in the segment grouping step. The grouping is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved using the well-known branch and bound algorithm. Finally, the full contours of the NPs are estimated by an ellipse. The experiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 150 BF TEM images containing approximately 2,700 NPs show that the proposed method outperforms five current state-of-art approaches in the overlapping NPs segmentation.},

abstract = {Exploration of cellular biomechanics properties has important pathophysiologic relevance since cellular response to external mechanical load play an significant role in the development of multitudinous clinical issues including cancer metastasis and diabetes. The qualification of cellular mechanical properties is of tremendous interest in biology and medicine. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is widely used as a quantitative nanoscale biometric tool for the characterization of cell morphology and mechanical properties. However, extraction of cellular mechanical properties from the measurements in the nanoscale remains quite complex due to challenges to analyze data according to proper theoretical model. In this paper, the cellular elastic and viscoelastic properties were characterized using AFM on murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells as a prototypical biomechanical system. The Young’s modulus at different subcellular regions labelled at nucleus, cytoplasm and edge of osteoblasts was analyzed according to Hertz model with sphere indenter. The morphology of single cell grown on fibronectin coated plastic petri dishes display a polygonal shape in cobblestone appearance with cytoskeleton arrangement along the long axis. The lowest Young’s modulus is observed at the cell nucleus, followed by the cytoplasm and the edge. The time dependent cellular mechanical behavior was also investigated for strain creep at constant external forces. The viscoelastic mechanical response at nuclear region is more notable than the perinuclear region. Our findings and results provide novel perspective for the biomechanical function of osteoblast and offers similar strategy pattern for understanding the structure-function correlation across varied length-scale in other biomechanical sub-systems.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate cellular biocompatibility of Ti coatings with varied thickness on titanium alloy substrates using osteoblasts and to explore the surface characteristics of implants, which are in favour of the growth of osteoblasts. Cellular behavior is closely related to the intersurface properties between host and implant. Ti is a type of biocompatible biomaterial. Sandblasting on titanium alloy will form a metal protective layer, which will prevent the release of toxic metal ions from titanium alloy. At the same time, it will increase the surface roughness as well as the area for cell growth. The intersurface roughness of Ti coatings with varied thicknesses is quite different. By comparing the growth and proliferation of osteoblasts grown on samples with varied thicknesses, a series of cell testings were performed. The proliferation ability of osteoblasts was measured by MTT assay, the cell activity was studied by CCK-8 assay, the surface of Ti coatings was characterized by scanning OM (Optical Microscope). Cell morphology grown on Ti interface was observed by fluorescence staining. The effect of Ti coating on the growth and proliferation of osteoblasts was studied on the basis of surface roughness. The result shows that with the increase of surface roughness, the ability of growth and proliferation of Murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 increased and that the three-dimensional cell growth was developed by the large surface roughness of Ti coating, which is promote the growth and adhesion of osteoblasts. The research results can be used in bone replacement and dental applications to improve the integration of implants and human tissues.},

abstract = {While mobile social apps have become increasingly important in people's daily life, we have limited understanding on what motivates users to engage with these apps. In this paper, we answer the question whether users' in-app activity patterns help inform their future app engagement (e.g., active days in a future time window)? Previous studies on predicting user app engagement mainly focus on various macroscopic features (e.g., time-series of activity frequency), while ignoring fine-grained inter-dependencies between different in-app actions at the microscopic level. Here we propose to formalize individual user's in-app action transition patterns as a temporally evolving action graph, and analyze its characteristics in terms of informing future user engagement. Our analysis suggested that action graphs are able to characterize user behavior patterns and inform future engagement. We derive a number of high-order graph features to capture in-app usage patterns and construct interpretable models for predicting trends of engagement changes and active rates. To further enhance predictive power, we design an end-to-end, multi-channel neural model to encode both temporal action graphs, activity sequences, and other macroscopic features. Experiments on predicting user engagement for 150k Snapchat new users over a 28-day period demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction models. The analysis and prediction framework is also deployed at Snapchat to deliver real world business insights. Our proposed framework is also general and can be applied to any online platform.},

abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana is the most important model specie employed for genetic analysis in plants. As it has been extensively proven, the first pair of extended leaves and its cellular and morphological changes during Arabidopsis development, is and accurate model to understand the molecular and physiological events that control cell cycle progression in plants. Nevertheless, cell analysis on leaves depends significantly on images acquired from a microscopy coupled to a drawing tube, where cells are traced by hand for posterior digitalization and analysis. This process is tedious, inaccurate and highly temporally inefficient. A new image processing method for cell detection in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana is presented. Using complementary image processing techniques, we introduce a good way to obtain the original cell contour shapes, surpassing the limitations given by factors like noise, stomata, blurred edges, and non-uniform illumination. Results show the new methodology minimizes considerably the time of cell detection compared with the microscopy coupled tube method, and produces matching percentages over 80%.},

abstract = {The development of antimalarial drugs requires performing laboratory experiments that include the analysis of blood smears infected with Plasmodium berghei. Analyzing visually the resulting microscopy images is usually a slow and tedious task prone to errors due to fatigue and subjectivity of the analysts. These facts motivated the creation of digital image processing systems to automate the aforementioned analysis. We present in this work a computer vision solution which processes microscopy images of blood smears. This system performs tasks like illumination correction, color compensation, image segmentation including separation of clumped objects and the extraction and selection of color features. Then a set of classifiers was tested to find the best one in terms of classification results. Here a new feature named pixels fraction was introduced and a number of other color features were extracted, from which a subset was selected for the classification of the cells into either normal or infected. The classifiers tested for this application were: support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), J48, Random Forest (RF), Na\"{\i}ve Bayes and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). All of them were evaluated in terms of their performance expressed as correct classification rate, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure and area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The usefulness of the pixels fraction as a new and effective feature was demonstrated by the experimental results. In regard of classifiers, J48 and Random Forest showed the best results.},

abstract = {The strength against fracture initiation from an interfacial edge in bonded micro-components (Si/Cu and Cu/SiN) is quantitatively evaluated by using a novel technique that combines a minute mechanical tester (nano-indenter) and a special high-voltage transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an environmental cell. The micro-component specimens having an interfacial edge of controlled geometry are prepared by a focused-ion-beam (FIB) based micro-sampling technique. The fracture initiation strength is particularly analyzed in terms of the fracture mechanics concept. In the case of Si/Cu interfacial edge, the scatter of strength value is significantly affected by the edge singularity: the higher singularity (wedged specimen) leads to the smaller scatter of strength. The effect of gaseous hydrogen (H2) on the strength of Cu/SiN is then evaluated by two kinds of wedged specimens. It is found that the strength is eminently reduced by the existence of H2 gas and, moreover, the strength reduction is dependent on specimen shape.},

Manual inspection under microscope is a time consuming and tedious work. There is a demand in industry for automatic conductive particle inspection system. The challenge of automatic conductive particle quality inspection is the complex background noise and diversified particle appearance, including shape, size, clustering and overlapping etc. As a result, there lacks effective automatic detection method to handle all the complex particle patterns. In this paper, we propose a U-shaped deep residual neural network (U-ResNet), which can learn features of particle from massive labeled data. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and recall rate, which exceedingly outperforms the previous work.},

abstract = {Recent advances in neuroscience have made it possible to reconstruct all neurons of an entire neural circuit in the larval fruit fly brain from serial electron microscopy image stacks. The reconstructed neurons are morphologically complex 3D graphs whose nodes are annotated with labels representing different types of synapses. Here, we propose a method to draw simplified, yet realistic 2D neuron sketches of insect neurons in order to help biologists formulate hypotheses on neural function at the microcircuit level. The sketches are dendrograms that capture a neuron's branching structure and that preserve branch lengths, providing realistic estimates for distances and signal travel times between synapses. To improve readability of the often densely clustered synapse annotations, synapses are automatically summarized in local clusters of synapses of the same type and arranged to minimize label overlap. We show that two major neuron classes of an olfactory circuit in the larval fruit fly brain can be discriminated visually based on the dendrograms. Unsupervised and supervised data analysis reveals that class discrimination can be performed using morphological features derived from the dendrograms.},

abstract = {The spectacular response observed in clinical trials of immunotherapy in patients with previously uncurable Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, calls for a better understanding of the cancer-immune interface. Computational pathology provides a unique opportunity to spatially dissect such interface on digitised pathological slides. Accurate cellular classification is a key to ensure meaningful results, but is often challenging even with state-of-art machine learning and deep learning methods.We propose a hierarchical framework, which mirrors the way pathologists perceive tumour architecture and define tumour heterogeneity to improve cell classification methods that rely solely on cell nuclei morphology. The SLIC superpixel algorithm was used to segment and classify tumour regions in low resolution H&amp;E-stained histological images of melanoma skin cancer to provide a global context. Classification of superpixels into tumour, stroma, epidermis and lumen/white space, yielded a 97.7% training set accuracy and 95.7% testing set accuracy in 58 whole-tumour images of the TCGA melanoma dataset. The superpixel classification was projected down to high resolution images to enhance the performance of a single cell classifier, based on cell nuclear morphological features, and resulted in increasing its accuracy from 86.4% to 91.6%. Furthermore, a voting scheme was proposed to use global context as biological a priori knowledge, pushing the accuracy further to 92.8%.This study demonstrates how using the global spatial context can accurately characterise the tumour microenvironment and allow us to extend significantly beyond single-cell morphological classification.},

abstract = {Humanity have long strived to create microscopic machines for various purposes. Most prominent of them employ nano-robots for medical purposes and procedures, otherwise deemed hard or impossible to perform. However, the main advantage of this kind, of machines is also their main drawback - their small size. The miniature scale they work in, brings a lot of problems, such as not having enough space for the computational power needed for their operation, or the specifics of the laws of physic that govern their behavior. In our study we focus on the former challenge, by introducing a new standpoint to the well-studied predator-prey pursuit problem (PPPP) using an implementation of very simple predator agents, using nano-robots designed to be morphologically simple. They feature direct mapping of the (few) perceived environmental variables into corresponding pairs of rotational velocities of the wheels' motors. Our previous, unpublished work showed that the classic problem with agents that use straightforward sensor, do not yield favorable results as they solve only a few of the initial test situations. We implemented genetic algorithm to evolve such a mapping that results in an optimal successful behavioral of the team of predator agents. In addition, to cope with the previously described issue, we introduced a simple change to the agents in order to improve the generality of the evolved behavior for additional test situations. Our approach is to implement an angular offset to the visibility sensor beam relative to the longitudinal axis of the agents. We added the offset to the genetic algorithm in order to define the best possible value, that introduces most efficient and consistent solution results. The successfully evolved behavior can be used in nano-robots to deliver medicine, locate and destroy cancer cells, pinpoint microscopic imaging, etc.1},

abstract = {We present a visual exploration environment tailored for large-scale spatio-temporal molecular dynamics simulation data. The environment is referred to as VIA-MD (visual interactive analysis of molecular dynamics) and has been developed in a participatory design process with domain experts on molecular dynamics simulations of complex molecular systems. A key feature of our approach is the support for linked interactive 3D exploration of geometry and statistical analysis using dynamic temporal windowing and animation. Based on semantic level descriptions and hierarchical aggregation of molecular properties we enable interactive filtering, which enables the user to effectively find spatial, temporal and statistical patterns. The VIA-MD environment provides an unprecedented tool for analysis of complex microscopic interactions hidden in large data volumes. We demonstrate the utility of the VIA-MD environment with four use cases. The first two deal with simulation of amyloid plaque associated with development of Alzheimer's, and we study an aqueous solution of 100 probes and an amyloid fibril. The identification of interaction "hotspots" is achieved with the use of combined filter parameters connected with probe molecular planarity and probe-fibril interaction energetics. The third and fourth examples show the wide applicability of the environment by applying it to analysis of molecular properties in material design.},

abstract = {The objective of the this work was to prepare poly (D, L-lactide) (PDLLA)/sirolimus coatings on poly (L-lactide) PLLA stents by ultrasonic atomizing spray technology and to evaluate their morphology, mechanical property and in vitro drug release kinetic. Morphology and thickness of polymer/drug coating were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the results show that the spray coating on stent surface was relatively homogeneous and smooth. Meanwhile, the mean roughness (Ra) of the coated stent surface was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and results shows the mean roughness was 10.5 nm. There was no delamination or cracking of the coating in the crimping and balloon expansion process. It was found that the coating has ability to withstand large deformation. The sirolimus loading amount could be precisely controlled in this study. The optimization experiment of release media showed that sirolimus seemed to be relatively stable in PBS (PH 7.4) with SDS or Brij58 compared to other media. The in vitro release of sirolimus immersed in two optimized release media were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All the in vitro release profiles of sirolimus showed biphasic release characteristics with an initial burst period followed by sustained release. In terms of sirolimus release amount, release profiles shown that sirolimus release in PBS with Brij58 was superior to that in PBS with SDS and appeared slow-release in first two days in 0.1% Brij58 concentration which meets the requirement for clinical use.},

In this paper, we study an automatic identification method of red and white cells in fecal microscopy images using a 20x magnification system. Firstly, this paper adopts a strategy based on the combination of logic operations for image segmentation. The edge detection is carried out on grayscale image and B channel image of the original color image separately, and the results are fused by or operation. The morphological processing is applied afterwards to remove the imperfections of segmentation, e.g. cell adhesion. And select relevant features to remove other visible components except red and white cells and impurities to obtain red and white cell segmentation images. Then according to the red and white cells in morphology, Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Canny image edge detection difference, obtained six related features to form a feature vector. Finally, the supported vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained by these features, and the trained SVM classifier is used to identify. The experimental results indicate that the recognition method proposed can achieve an accuracy about 90%, which satisfies the demand from the practice.},

abstract = {Cell nuclei detection and fine-grained classification have been fundamental yet challenging problems in histopathology image analysis. Due to the nuclei tiny size, significant inter-/intra-class variances, as well as the inferior image quality, previous automated methods would easily suffer from limited accuracy and robustness. In the meanwhile, existing approaches usually deal with these two tasks independently, which would neglect the close relatedness of them. In this paper, we present a novel method of sibling fully convolutional network with prior objectness interaction (called SFCN-OPI) to tackle the two tasks simultaneously and interactively using a unified end-to-end framework. Specifically, the sibling FCN branches share features in earlier layers while holding respective higher layers for specific tasks. More importantly, the detection branch outputs the objectness prior which dynamically interacts with the fine-grained classification sibling branch during the training and testing processes. With this mechanism, the fine-grained classification successfully focuses on regions with high confidence of nuclei existence and outputs the conditional probability, which in turn benefits the detection through back propagation. Extensive experiments on colon cancer histology images have validated the effectiveness of our proposed SFCN-OPI and our method has outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

In particular, I consider micro-scale drops of water from different aquatic systems after evaporation in an attempt to discover morphological features of the patterns related to water contamination. My artistic intervention of a scientific process through experimenting with the SEM is a way to find what potentially different things my images can say about water to a viewer. My practice aims to draw attention to the qualities of water through enhanced visual details, their interpretation, and differentiation between water samples. By exploring the nature of the SEM, the implications of the digital era to representation data in science and the interplay between the indexical and iconic modalities in the process of evaluating scientific photomicrographs, I try to imbue them with new meanings and to use scientific photography as a creative source of communication to the general public.},

abstract = {Particle tracking has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the swarm control of microrobots and the dynamic biological processes in the life sciences. In seed plants, pollen tubes, a part of the male gametophyte, are excellent models for understanding plant growth and cellular behavior, because vesicle motion within pollen tubes reveals important information about vesicle function and interactions. Conventional vesicle tracking is based on spatiotemporal image analysis, which requires high-quality images and vesicles with constant velocity. For in vivo tracking, vesicles may disappear in some frames, and image sequences may have spatial and temporal distortions, which hamper vesicle tracking for broader applications. In this paper, we studied intracellular motion during pollen tube growth with an optical flow method. Streaming images from confocal and optical microscopes were recorded to study the intracellular motion of vesicles of different size. Local motion for each vesicle was detected using a local displacement vector field. The displacement from two adjacent frames was then calculated. The flow field shows information such as the dynamics of vesicle secretion, endocytosis, exocytosis, and cytoskeletal stability. Vesicles from different regions inside the tube were tracked simultaneously with a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature matching algorithm. The spatial and temporal characteristics of intracellular vesicles were evaluated. The proposed methods can be of great use for studying the dynamics of fluorescently tagged particles in biological systems.},

abstract = {Traffic accident statistics as functions of the involved accident parameters are important sources of information to investigate accident causes. However, since traffic accidents are sparse events and the factors that lead to an accident can be very diverse, it is difficult to establish a direct link which relates microscopic risk models to the empirical findings. One seminal and widely debated work on accident statistics on multi-lane roadways is given by the so-called “Solomon curve” [1], which describes the collision rate of automobiles as a function of their speed. While one particular characteristic of the Solomon curve - its u-shape - has been explained theoretically in terms of traffic flow of passing cars in [2], a detailed derivation from microscopic risk models is still missing. In this paper, we start from a first-principles generalized risk model, and reconfirm the explanation of the curve, revealing that its parameters can be fully mapped to the parameters of the underlying microscopic risk model. In addition, an unexplained effect of the Solomon curve - the asymmetry of its minimum with respect to the average velocity - is predicted and explained by the derivation. The result then is two-fold: On one hand, we can now fully understand the Solomon curve in terms of microscopic risk parameters, and on the other hand, the empirical findings of the Solomon curve serve as a validation of the risk model and can be used to gain reasonable settings for microscopic risk parameters.},

abstract = {In order to deal with ambiguous image appearances in cell segmentation, high-level shape modeling has been introduced to delineate cell boundaries. However, shape modeling usually requires sufficient annotated training shapes, which are often labor intensive or unavailable. Meanwhile, when applying the model to different datasets, it is necessary to repeat the tedious annotation process to generate enough training data, and this will significantly limit the applicability of the model. In this paper, we propose to transfer shape modeling learned from an existing but different dataset (e.g. lung cancer) to assist cell segmentation in a new target dataset (e.g. skeletal muscle) without expensive manual annotations. Considering the intrinsic geometry structure of cell shapes, we incorporate the shape transfer model into a sparse representation framework with a manifold embedding constraint, and provide an efficient algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is tested on multiple microscopy image datasets with different tissue and staining preparations, and the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Integrative analysis based on quantitative representation of whole slide images (WSIs) in a large histology cohort may provide predictive models of clinical outcome. On one hand, the efficiency and effectiveness of such representation is hindered as a result of large technical variations (e.g., fixation, staining) and biological heterogeneities (e.g., cell type, cell state) that are always present in a large cohort. On the other hand, perceptual interpretation/validation of important multi-variate phenotypic signatures are often difficult due to the loss of visual information during feature transformation in hyperspace. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach for integrative analysis based on cellular morphometric context, which is a robust representation of WSI, with the emphasis on tumor architecture and tumor heterogeneity, built upon cellular level morphometric features within the spatial pyramid matching (SPM) framework. The proposed approach is applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower grade glioma (LGG) cohort, where experimental results (i) reveal several clinically relevant cellular morphometric types, which enables both perceptual interpretation/validation and further investigation through gene set enrichment analysis; and (ii) indicate the significantly increased survival rates in one of the cellular morphometric context subtypes derived from the cellular morphometric context.},

abstract = {Micromanipulation of individual biological cells, such as embryos during preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is a delicate and time-consuming task. Two major procedures in PGD include the rotation of the embryo to gain a more favorable position for zona breaching, and the extraction of a blastomere after an opening has been made in the zona pellucida. Rotation tracking of cleavage-stage embryos has not been reported given their lack of distinctive features. In this manuscript, a geometric model for partially determining the three dimensional (3-D) angular position of 2-cell embryos using two dimensional (2-D) microscopic brightfield images was derived and verified using a computer generated model. This model was then applied using computer vision algorithms on a rotating cleavage-stage mouse embryo, demonstrating partial 3-D rotation tracking. Furthermore, embryo micromanipulation tasks are typically performed manually using micropipettes. Technological advances have made automation of these tasks possible. This manuscript also presents computer vision algorithms for the segmentation and calibration of micropipettes. The calibration procedure allowed automated position control of the micropipettes without the need for real-time vision feedback using micropipette recognition algorithms, and effective position control was verified using semi-automated blastomere extraction experiments. This manuscript presents preliminary work towards the automation of cell manipulation procedures.},

abstract = {Microscopic image analysis of nuclei in pathology images generates tremendous amount of spatially derived data to support biomedical research and potential diagnosis. Such spatial data can be managed by traditional SQL based spatial databases and queried by SQL for spatial relationships. However, traditional spatial databases are designed for structured data with limited expressibility, which is difficult to support queries for complex visual patterns. Moreover, SQL based queries are not intuitive for biomedical researchers or pathologists.In this paper, we investigate the expressive power of visual query for spatial databases and propose an effective yet general Iterative Example-based Visual Query IEVQuery framework to query shapes and distributions. More specifically, we extract features from nuclei in pathology databases, such as shape polygon nuclei density distribution, and nuclei growth directions to build search indexes. The user employs visual interactions such as sketching to input queries for interesting patterns. Meanwhile, the user is allowed to iteratively create queries, which are based on previous search results, to finely tune the features more accurately to find preferred results. We build a system to enable users to specify sketch based queries interactively for 1 nuclei shapes, 2 nuclei densities, and 3 nuclei growth directions. To validate our methods, we take a pathology database [11] consisting of hundreds of millions of nuclei, and enable the user to search in the database to find most matching results through our system.},

abstract = {Sperm-shaped microrobots are controlled under the influence of weak oscillating magnetic fields (milliTesla range) to selectively target cell mockups (i.e., gas bubbles with average diameter of 200 µm). The sperm-shaped microrobots are fabricated by electrospinning using a solution of polystyrene, dimethylformamide, and iron oxide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are concentrated within the head of the microrobot, and hence enable directional control along external magnetic fields. The magnetic dipole moment of the microrobot is characterized (using the flip-time technique) to be 1.4\texttimes{}10−11 A.m2, at magnetic field of 28 mT. In addition, the morphology of the microrobot is characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy images. The characterized parameters and morphology are used in the simulation of the locomotion mechanism of the microrobot to prove that its motion depends on breaking the time-reversal symmetry, rather than pulling with the magnetic field gradient. We experimentally demonstrate that the microrobot can controllably follow S-shaped, U-shaped, and square paths, and selectively target the cell mockups using image guidance and under the influence of the oscillating magnetic fields.},

abstract = {Fast and high-resolution scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM) experiments require a high speed, low noise and low distortion transimpedance amplifier (TIA) as interface circuit. Recent high performance TIAs utilize capacitive feedback. However, their inability to treat DC currents renders them unfavorable for SICM applications and resistive TIAs remain the best choice here. To address this problem, this paper presents an active MOS resistor with improved robustness and linearity to make it suitable for its use as feedback resistor in TIAs for SICM experiments. The presented device features PMOS transistors operating in weak inversion as pseudo-resistors to obtain reduced noise compared to ohmic resistors of the same value. A novel bias circuit is introduced which compensates process variations of the pseudo-resistor. Monte Carlo simulation shows a standard deviation of 3.6 % of the overall resistance. The connection of multiple pseudo-resistors in series, while preserving equal overall resistance, linearizes the I-V characteristic and decreases the total harmonic distortion to 0.26 %. The presented device is incorporated into a low noise and high speed TIA achieving a simulated SNDR of 49 dB over a bandwidth of 1 MHz enabling fast high-resolution topography imaging using SICM.},

Through comparison with other well-known models, the areas of improvement are elucidated. The FFM is a leading microscopic pedestrian model that uses cellular automation (CA), but it does not accurately reflect the physical characteristics of pedestrians, such as their size, shape, and posture. Therefore, it is difficult for the existing FFM to simulate certain phenomena, such as collisions and friction between pedestrians. This study proposes an improved FFM that can simulate these phenomena, and experiments were carried out to compare this model with other models, such as the existing FFM, Simulex, and Pathfinder, to confirm the improvements. Through this experiment, it was confirmed that inter-pedestrian phenomena, such as collisions, friction, and jamming, could be realistically simulated.},

abstract = {Dramatic improvements have been made in the field of digital image processing especially for biomedical image analysis over the past decade. With the availability of modern digital scanners, histopathology slides can be easily stored in digitized color image format. Therefore, histopathology digitized images have become a popular data source for both computer vision and machine learning techniques. There are several computer aided algorithms currently available to assist pathology experts to carry out their routine examination for detecting various tissues such as ovarian cancer cells and ovarian reproductive tissues. Automated detection of ovarian reproductive tissues is one of the important diagnosis interests for pathologists these days. One of the popular diagnosis preferences to identify ovarian tissues is ultrasound scanner. However, due to different shape, size and color, identification of ovarian tissues is a challenging task for ultrasound scanners as it process gray scale images. At present, pathological microscopic manual analysis is considered the best laboratory analysis practice for ovarian tissue cells although it is time-consuming, laborious and prone to errors. An alternate option would be to analyze these ovarian tissues automatically using color digitized images acquired from microscopic slides. In this paper a fully automated detection approach for color digitized image acquired from microscopic slides is presented and analyzed. The proposed method was found to be faster in comparison to other approaches. The approach also is beneficial as experts will not need to tune processing parameters for new batches of images. Experimental results from an analysis of the proposed approach using batch processing of a large number of images indicated high degree of accuracy and performance compared to the manual microscopic analysis.},

Our method computes fast, and is able to preserve gland boundaries robustly and detect glands accurately. We tested the performance of gland detection and segmentation by analyzing a dataset of 1723 glands from digitized high-resolution clinical histology images obtained in normal and diseased intestines. The experimental results show that our method outperforms considerably the state-of-the-art methods for gland segmentation and detection tasks.},

abstract = {Recent advances in microscopy imaging and genomics have created an explosion of patient data in the pathology domain. Whole-slide images (WSIs) of tissues can now capture disease processes as they unfold in high resolution, recording the visual cues that have been the basis of pathologic diagnosis for over a century. Each WSI contains billions of pixels and up to a million or more microanatomic objects whose appearances hold important prognostic information. Computational image analysis enables the mining of massive WSI datasets to extract quantitative morphologic features describing the visual qualities of patient tissues. When combined with genomic and clinical variables, this quantitative information provides scientists and clinicians with insights into disease biology and patient outcomes. To facilitate interaction with this rich resource, we have developed a web-based machine-learning framework that enables users to rapidly build classifiers using an intuitive active learning process that minimizes data labeling effort. In this paper we describe the architecture and design of this system, and demonstrate its effectiveness through quantification of glioma brain tumors.},

We present a method for optimizing such complexes using an energy minimization process, designed to make them fit to the actual adjacencies in the tissue. The resulting dual meshes constitute a light discrete representation of the cell surfaces that enables fast visualization, and quantitative analysis, and allows in silico physical and mechanical simulations on real-world data.},

abstract = {Electrified transportation has emerged as a trend to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. Electric (road) vehicles are one of the main features associated with transportation electrification. They aim to reduce the use of non-renewable vehicle's fuel resources (Petrol, Diesel, etc.) and depend on renewable energy. However, EVs interact with three interconnected systems: the transportation system, the electric power grid, and their supporting information systems often called intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Therefore, the true success of electric vehicles depends on their successful integration with the infrastructure systems that support them. Consequently, transportation electrification as a new trend requires simulation tools that are capable of building-up schemes close to real life scenarios. This paper presents a benchmark analysis of open source transportation electrification simulation tools. The holistic assessment consists of a 2 level analysis. First, a list of available traffic simulation tools open source and commercial is classified into macro, meso and microscopic simulators. Second, an in-depth comparison analysis is conducted for only micro &amp; mesoscopic open source tools. This analysis aims to depict the overall features of these tools such as inclusion of electric vehicle functionality, source-code accessibility &amp; customizability and simulation performance. The study finds that while none of these tools has truly addressed the breadth of transportation electrification research, MATSIM, SUMO and TRANSIMS all have promising characteristics for future development.},

abstract = {Environmental Microorganisms (EMs), such as Epistylis and Rotifera, are very tiny living beings in human environments and decompose pollutants as their nutrition. The classification of EMs plays a fundamental role for establishing sustainable ecosystem. However, this is traditionally done by molecular methods using DNA or RNA analysis, or morphological methods using microscopes. These methods require huge monetary costs or manual efforts. In this paper, we propose an EM classification method by directly processing microscopic images. We especially address two problems: The first is a small training dataset problem. Because EM samples are collected from unstable real-world environments, it is difficult to stably obtain a large number of EM images. To effectively represent scarce training images, we use Sparse Coding (SC) which extracts sufficient local features from an image and reconstructs it by a sparse linear combination of bases. The second is a noisy image problem. Because EM samples are often found in dirty regions, their images often show a noisy background. To overcome this, we use Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) which jointly performs the localisation and classification of EMs by examining the local information in training images. Experimental results on real-world images show the effectiveness and potential of our system.},

Our method uses a low-order parametric reflectance model, and incorporates strong assumptions about lighting and shape. We develop new priors about how materials mix over space, and jointly infer all of these properties from a single image. This produces a decomposition of an image which corresponds, in one sense, to microscopic features (material reflectance) and macroscopic features (weights defining the mixing properties of materials over space). We have built a large dataset of real objects rendered with different material models under different illumination fields for training and ground truth evaluation. Extensive experiments on both our synthetic dataset images as well as real images show that (a) our method recovers parameters with reasonable accuracy; (b) material parameters recovered by our method give accurate predictions of new renderings of the object; and (c) our low-order reflectance model still provides a good fit to many real-world reflectances.},

Depending on the scanning dimensions an expected AFM image structure is subjected to be modified by great amounts of external noise (low Signal/Noise ratios) - electrical or mechanical - and/or blurring due to the geometry of the measuring probe. In order to minimize such effects, image restoration techniques can be employed. The one based on the minimization of the Tikhonov's regularization functional is described, taking into account the characteristics of the measuring probe and the S/N ratio. This work proposes optimizations on both serial and parallel restoration algorithms, using CUDA library on a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit, GPGPU, in terms of time performance and quality of restoration in regime of high speed imaging, one frame/sec or more. The results obtained are so far very promising, reaching speedups up to 43x over previous implementations.},

abstract = {Selecting structures from volume data using direct over-the-visualization interactions, such as a paint brush, is perhaps the most intuitive method in a variety of application scenarios. Unfortunately, it seems difficult to design a universal tool that is effective for all different structures in biology research. In [WOCH12b], an interactive technique was proposed for extracting neural structures from confocal microscopy data. It uses a dual-stroke paint brush to select desired structures directly from volume visualizations. However, the technique breaks down when it was applied to selecting densely packed structures with condensed shapes, such as nuclei from zebrafish eye development research. We collaborated with biologists studying zebrafish eye development and adapted the paint brush tool for real-time nucleus selection from volume data. The morphological diffusion algorithm used in the previous paint brush is restricted to gradient descending directions for improved nucleus boundary definition. Occluded seeds are removed using backward ray-casting. The adapted paint brush is then used in tracking cell movements in a time sequence dataset of a developing zebrafish eye.},

abstract = {Occurrence of certain environmental microorganisms and their species is a very informative indicator to evaluate environmental quality. Unfortunately, their manual recognition in microbiological laboratories is very time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we work on an automatic method for shape-based classification of EMs in microscopic images. First, we segment the microorganisms from the background. Second, we describe their shapes by discriminative feature vectors. Third, we perform the EM classification using Support Vector Machines. The most important scientific contribution of this paper, in comparison to the state-of-the-art and to our previous publications in this field, is the introduction of a completely new and very robust 2D feature descriptor for EM shapes. Experimental results certify the effectiveness and practicability of our automatic EM classification system emphasising the benefits achieved with the new shape descriptor proposed in this work.},

abstract = {The assessment of embryos in vitro is an important tool both in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment and for research purposes. Traditionally, such assessment has been done manually and demands extensive training and expertise. Interobserver variability limits the use of evaluation, and the manual labor increases the cost of treatment and research. To this end, feature extraction and automatic annotation using computer aided tools would both improve objectivity and save time. Due to the sensitivity of embryos, any evaluation must be performed using non-invasive imaging techniques, which sets a limit for the ability to artificially enhance image contrast, and computer aided assessment of microscopic images under clinical conditions also poses a number of difficulties due to the high level of noise and the unpredictable imaging environment. To overcome this, we propose a framework using a Hough Transform (HT) for the extraction of circular shapes in microscopic embryo images, and also use the algorithm for successful automatic profiling of the pronuclear breakdown (PNB) at syngami and detection of its timing. The best results are achieved when using a HT for embryo outline detection in combination with image variance of the embryo interior. Using our method, we achieve an overall accuracy of 95.0% detecting the position of the embryo outline, and 83.0% detecting the timing of the PNB.},

Specifically, we show how 3D shape of objects immersed in water can be extracted from images captured under an optical microscope. Traditional SFF employs telecentric optics to achieve geometric registration among the frames. We extend conventional SFF to underwater objects under the assumption of negligible scattering. We establish that the property of telecentricity holds for objects immersed in water provided the numerical aperture is small. By modeling geometrical distortions due to refraction effects on the water surface, we prove that the depth map obtained in the presence of water is a scaled version of the original depth map. We also reveal that this scale factor is directly related to the refractive index of water. We validate performance with real experiments.},

Proposed method is based on the use of the Approximate Entropy formerly introduced by Pincusembedded within a Geodesic Active Contour approach. Approximate Entropy can be seen as an estimatorof the regularity of a particular sequence of values and, consequently, can be used as an edge detector. Inthis prospective study, a preliminary study on Approximate Entropy as an edge detector function is first proposedwith a particular focus on the robustness to noise, and some promising membrane segmentation resultsobtained on confocal microscopy images are also shown.},

Image quality evaluation plays various roles in different image coding stages. In three stages, its functions are in turn providing direct modify data to optimize watermarking algorithms, evaluating robustness of the attacked watermark, and judging the veracity of product packaging, respectively, The idea of image dissimilarity expounds the presentation form, the characteristic direction and the generated reasons of differences before and after images distortion. It aims at using one-dimensional, two-dimensional or multi-dimensional spatial feature to express mathematically the macroscopic or microscopic transformation of the attacked image, At present, the classification method is uncommon that image quality evaluation is divided into image dissimilarity and image similarity. The image quality evaluation methods based on image similarity is numerous, while a few methods based on image dissimilarity are only presented from the two metrics of pixels gray value and singular values. But the latter could just makes up for its some shortages. Then according to the ideal of image similarity, it is feasible to in-depth research and establish the unified quality evaluation standard of watermarked printing image base image dissimilarity.},

The majority of bacteria in the human body are countered by the human immune system, however some pathogenic bacteria survive and cause disease. Enabling of remote control and visualization of pathogenic species can reduce direct exposure of researchers. The visualization of augmented biological data can also speed up the extraction of useful information. This can be achieved using contactless interactions with viewed scenes, by the use of camera based gesture recognition technologies. Utilising an immersive environment such as a 3-D hemispherical dome for visualization can also enhance user experience when exploring complex interior structures and morphology of bacteria during the course of biofilm formation. Our aim is to uncover limitations of current technology for the design of a real-time natural contactless interactive system. In this work, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) experiments are carried out with Creative Interactive Gesture Camera as a touchless input device to track a user's hand gestures and translate them into the natural field of view or point of focus. In experiments, the touchless interface is compared with a touch-based system using an iPad device during a task-oriented user study. Conclusions are drawn based on statistical analysis of user experience in interaction experiments with microscopy images of bacteria in bacterial biofilm formation. Future investigations will use an the dome immersive environment where 3D bacterium shapes will be visualized from their 2D images.},

abstract = {The microscopic geometry of white matter carries rich information about brain function in health and disease. A key challenge for medical imaging is to estimate microstructural features noninvasively. One important parameter is the axon diameter, which correlates with the conduction time delay of action potentials and is affected by various neurological disorders. Diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) experiments are the method of choice today when we aim to recover the axon diameter distribution, although the technique requires very high gradient strengths in order to assess nerve fibers with one micrometer or less in diameter. In practice in-vivo brain imaging is only sensitive to the largest axons, not least due to limitations in the human physiology which tolerates only moderate gradient strengths. This work studies, from a theoretical perspective, the feasibility of T2 -spectroscopy to resolve submicrometer tissue structures. Exploiting the surface relaxation effect, we formulate a plausible biophysical model relating the axon diameter distribution to the T2 -weighted signal, which is based on a surface-to-volume ratio approximation of the Bloch---Torrey equation. Under a certain regime of bulk and surface relaxation coefficients, our simulation results suggest that it might be possible to reveal axons smaller than one micrometer in diameter.},

abstract = {Image-based classification of tissue histology, in terms of different components (e.g., normal signature, categories of aberrant signatures), provides a series of indices for tumor composition. Subsequently, aggregation of these indices in each whole slide image (WSI) from a large cohort can provide predictive models of clinical outcome. However, the performance of the existing techniques is hindered as a result of large technical and biological variations that are always present in a large cohort. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for classification of tissue histology based on robust representations of morphometric context, which are built upon nuclear level morphometric features at various locations and scales within the spatial pyramid matching (SPM) framework. These methods have been evaluated on two distinct datasets of different tumor types collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the experimental results indicate that our methods are (i) extensible to different tumor types, (ii) robust in the presence of wide technical and biological variations, (iii) invariant to different nuclear segmentation strategies, and (iv) scalable with varying training sample size. In addition, our experiments suggest that enforcing sparsity, during the construction of morphometric context, further improves the performance of the system.},

In this paper we describe an approach for analyzing nanoscale microscopy images in which spots and background structures are identified and their relationship is quantified. A spatial analysis approach is used for identifying spots, then clustering of these spots is performed and those clusters are characterized using a series of here defined features. These cluster characteristics are used for comparing images via statistical hypothesis tests (using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the equality of probability distributions). Moreover, to achieve a better distinction we additionally define features that quantify the relationship of clusters of spots and background structures. In the empirical section we demonstrate the use of this approach in the analysis of microscopy images of brain structures of patients potentially suffering from a neural disease (e.g., depression or schizophrenia). Using the here presented approach we will be able to investigate the development and state of various diseases in a better way and help to find more systematic medication of diseases in the future.},

abstract = {Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool as far as surface characterization is concerned, due to its ability to relate high resolution imaging with mechanical properties. Furthermore biological samples, such as collagen, can be studied by AFM with a non-destructive manner. Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals and because of its unique properties is widely used as biomaterial. Due to the human skin chronic exposure to sun light and since UV-rays are used in sterilizing and cross linking methods of collagen based biomaterials, the investigation of the influence of UV light on collagen, is crucial. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the topographic features and the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils prior and post ultraviolet (UV) by using the AFM indentation method. Hence, load-displacement curves were obtained on collagen fibrils in order to calculate the Young modulus for each case. Each curve presented, was the average of 10 curves. The results showed that Young modulus value increased after 4 hours of UV irradiation from 0.5 GPa to 1.53 GPa. After 8 hours of UV irradiation the Young modulus value was calculated equal to 3.2 GPa. These experiments yielded a clear stiffening of collagen fibrils as a result of UV exposure. Moreover, after 8 hours of UV exposure, collagen fibrillar structure started to deform and the characteristic D-band of collagen fibrils deteriorated. The investigation of the alterations of the modulus under UV irradiation, will contribute to the clarification of the impact that different physical and chemical parameters have on the mechanical properties of collagen-based materials. In addition, this will enable the design and development of biomaterials with improved properties.},

abstract = {Materials science brings innovations for creating novel human activity by discovering new materials with various functionalities such as semiconductors, superconductors, and ferromagnets. In condensed matter physics, these different characteristics of materials are understood microscopically by different behavior of electrons, which can be eagerly simulated on high power computer. The simulation is performed in the quantum level focusing on the behavior of electrons around atoms which form lattice of various shapes. The main task in the simulation thus corresponds to diagonalize a Hamiltonian matrix for the lattice system and evaluate the electronic density of energy states. The local density of states (LDOS) is one of the most fundamental quantities to investigate materials properties including electronic conductivity and localization. Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) is one of the major efficient methods for diagonalizaing Hamiltonian matrix, which decreases the complexity significantly compared to the full diagonalization method. However, it is hard to have a large speedup in a computing resource with multicore CPUs due to the bottleneck of the memory interface. This paper focuses on improving the performance applying GPU to the LDOS calculation using the large bandwidth of GPUs. This paper shows the parallel design and its implementation of LDOS algorithm on a single GPU and also extended on a GPU cluster. According to the performance evaluation, we confirm that the GPU-based parallelization applying a GPU cluster computer achieves the higher performance equivalent to about 24 times larger number of CPU cores.},

abstract = {We propose a framework for studying visual morphological patterns across histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs). Image representation is an important component of computer-aided decision support systems for histopathological cancer diagnosis. Such systems extract hundreds of quantitative image features from digitized tissue biopsy slides and produce models for prediction. The performance of these models depends on the identification of informative features for selection of appropriate regions-of-interest (ROIs) from heterogeneous WSIs and for development of models. However, identification of informative features is hindered by the semantic gap between human interpretation of visual morphological patterns and quantitative image features. We address this challenge by using data mining and information visualization tools to study spatial patterns formed by features extracted from sub-sections of WSIs. Using ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OvCa) WSIs provided by the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), we show that (1) individual and (2) multivariate image features correspond to biologically relevant ROIs, and (3) supervised image feature selection can map histopathology domain knowledge to quantitative image features.},

abstract = {Fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has revolutionized imaging of subcellular structures in biomedical research by enabling the acquisition of 3D time-series of fluorescently-tagged proteins in living cells, hence forming the basis for an automated quantification of their morphological and dynamic characteristics. Due to the inherently weak fluorescence, CLSM images exhibit a low SNR. We present a novel model for the transfer of signal and noise in CLSM that is both theoretically sound as well as corroborated by a rigorous analysis of the pixel intensity statistics via measurement of the 3D noise power spectra, signal-dependence and distribution. Our model provides a better fit to the data than previously proposed models. Further, it forms the basis for (i) the simulation of the CLSM imaging process indispensable for the quantitative evaluation of CLSM image analysis algorithms, (ii) the application of Poisson denoising algorithms and (iii) the reconstruction of the fluorescence signal.},

abstract = {As technology advances continue reducing transistor features, microscopic variations in number and location of dopant atoms in the channel region induce increasing electrical deviations in device parameters such as the threshold voltage. Deviations refer to mismatches with respect to device parameters at design time. These deviations are specially important in SRAM cells whose transistors are constructed with minimum geometry to fulfill area constraints, since they can cause some cells to fail.In this paper, we study the impact of threshold voltage variations in the stability of the cell for a 16nm technology node. The failure probability has been studied for the four types of SRAM failures: write, access, read, and hold. We found that, under the assumed experimental conditions, the two former types of failures can be reduced by increasing the wordline pulse width of the cell. Experimental results show that access failures can be reduced up to 43.9% and write failures around 23.4% by enlarging the wordline pulse by 5 times the nominal width.},

For this pourpose, a pipeline of morphological operators were implemented for the segmentation of cell nuclei and the Delaunay Triangulation were used in order to represent the tissue architecture. Also, clustering algorithms and graph morphology were used to automatically obtain the boundary between the histological layers of the epithelial tissue. Similarity criteria and adjacency relations between the triangles of the network were explored. The proposed method was evaluated concerning the detection of the presence of lesions in the tissue as well as the their malignancy grading.},

We applied the present procedure to the characteristic gene sets of seven subtypes of testicular germ cell tumors in a previous report. The cellular relationships were well reconstructed, consistent with the general histologic lineage model, and new implications for the subtype differentiation were found. In particular, the correspondence between the inferred relationships and the functional characterizations of constituent genes suggests a hypothesis for the classification between seminoma and embryonal carcinoma. The partial canonical correlation analysis is also appropriate for revealing new features of cellular relationships, based on the transcriptional programs. Thus, the present procedure helps to create a macroscopic view of the cellular relationships, by following the detection of the characteristically expressed genes.},

abstract = {The morphological analysis of muscle biopsy helps in diagnosis of neuromuscular disease. The presence, extent, size, shape, and other morphological appearance of the muscle fibres are important indicators for presence or severity of disease. However, estimation of these parameters by simple visual inspection is inaccurate and subjective and manual delineation of individual muscle fibres from muscle biopsy images is time-consuming and tedious. In this study, two automatic segmentation methods are proposed. Both methods operate on fluorescence microscopy images. The first uses a level set framework and the second one a marker-driven watershed transform. In a first stage, mathematical morphology is used to detect the presence of muscle fibres. The result of this step provides requirements for both segmentation methods (initial contour and markers). Experimental results demonstrate that segmentation of watershed detects fibres contours more accurately and with a lower computational cost.},

abstract = {We study the problem of segmenting multiple cell nuclei from GFP or Hoechst stained microscope images with a shape prior. This problem is encountered ubiquitously in cell biology and developmental biology. Our work is motivated by the observation that segmentations with loose boundary or shrinking bias not only jeopardize feature extraction for downstream tasks (e.g. cell tracking), but also prevent robust statistical analysis (e.g. modeling of fluorescence distribution). We therefore propose a novel extension to the graph cut framework that incorporates a “blob”-like shape prior. The corresponding energy terms are parameterized via structured learning. Extensive evaluation and comparison on 2D/3D datasets show substantial quantitative improvement over other state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method achieves an 8.2% Rand index increase and a 4.3 Hausdorff distance decrease over the second best method on a public hand-labeled 2D benchmark.},

Because an excessive stress concentration at the implant-abutment interface is suggested to be critical for the long-term success of implant therapy, the analyses of this aspect can make it possible to evaluate the type of failure of the system and identify its weakest elements.

abstract = {Development and utilization of bio-energy is an important way to relieve the pressure of global energy shortage. Biodiesel can be a focus of the bio-energy, because it is a cleaner-burning and renewable fuel. Micro algae have been considered to be an ideal source of biodiesel for its high growth rate and high lipid content. Benthic diatoms in tidal mud are considered to be new candidate for obtaining high lipid content micro algal strains although they have not been well noticed. The purpose of this study is getting the diatom strains with high-lipid content from tidal mud toward biofuel production. With microtubule method, four diatom strains were successfully isolated from the tidal mud located in Haicang, Xiamen. They are Navicula halophila, Nitzschia frustulum var. symbiotica, Amphora coffeaeformis, and Nitzschia closterium. The characteristics of morphology, ecology, and distribution of each species are described in the present paper with images of light microscope and electron microscope. Diatoms were cultured in the laboratory and the lipid content of each strain was determined. The lipid content (% dried weight) of the four diatoms are: Navicula halophila 39.1%, Nitzschia frustulum var. symbiotica 35.7%, Amphora coffeaeformis 26.1%, and Nitzschia closterium 18.9%. The result indicates that the lipid content of diatoms from tidal mud is relatively higher compared to the strains from seawater which can be a good source candidate of micro algal biodiesel.},

The microstructure and tensile fracture surface of its welding joint were observed by optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Tensile test was conducted to assess the joint's mechanical property. The results show that, the microstructure of weld zone is composed of austenite matrix and ferrite. The size of grains grows up with the increase of heat input. With the increase of welding speed, the morphology of ferrite transforms from skeleton to lath-shaped and the quantity of ferrite increases significantly. Further more, side-plate ferrite becomes more slender and the joint strength increases with the increase of welding speed. With a suitable welding parameter (welding current of 170A, welding speed of 207mm/min), the weld shows better mechanical property with the max sb of 623 Mpa and d of 49%.},

First, an automatic thresholding method is used to obtain axon candidates and then geometric and image properties are used to assure the axon regions. Second, the outer contour of myelin sheath is segmented using the active contour model with the obtained axon contour as the initial solution. Then, the desired morphological parameters can be readily measured. In the experiments, we used seven nerve images for accuracy validation and achieved very small contour distance errors (less than 0.5 μm with nerve diameter around 8 μm in average). Overall, the proposed method is found efficient and useful in nerve parameter evaluation.},

The corresponding pathological information derived has a spatial precision accurate up to 1.6μgm. TVNMHA also employs optical flow method (OFM) to measure the velocity of the flowing plasma gaps between two consecutive frames with an error 10-32μgm/sec [1]. The laser Doppler velocimetry is a common tool employed in measuring capillary with larger diameter (is about 500μgm). The average velocity of an area measured comes with an error around 100μgm/sec [2], much higher than that of TVNMHA. TVNMHA can separately derive velocities for each capillaries within the whole microscopic range and obtain diversified morphological/hemodynamic features of capillaries with a low-cost equipment setup.},

On a small scale, the soil micro-fabric can be studied by looking at undisturbed samples under a scanning electron microscope or it can be described under high-resolution optical microscope in thin section. Different kinds of soil fabrics indicated different sedimentary environments under which the soils formed before; also it could show the information of different property and distinct material composition of soils. Engineering properties of soil were connected tightly with its structure and fabric. In geo-technique science, there existed many methods to describe the soil's structure and fabric. It has been proved that fractal dimension and multi-fractal theory are efficient way in the studying of soil's fabric. With the help of fractal dimension and multi-fractal spectrum, efforts were taken to analyze the micro-porous structural features in great overburden clay. The study shows that fractal dimension can distinguish the fine difference between the two type of soil such as undisturbed soil sample and dry shrinkage soil sample. The multi-fractal spectrum of these two kinds of soil showed the same conclusion.},

abstract = {Microscopic cellular images segmentation has become an important routine procedure in modern biological research, due to the rapid advancement of fluorescence probes and robotic microscopes in recent years. In this paper we advocate a discriminative learning approach for cellular image segmentation. In particular, three new features are proposed to capture the appearance, shape and context information, respectively. Experiments are conducted on three different cellular image datasets. Despite the significant disparity among these datasets, the proposed approach is demonstrated to perform reasonably well. As expected, for a particular dataset, some features turn out to be more suitable than others. Interestingly, we observe that a further gain can often be obtained on top of using the "good" features, by also retaining those features that perform poorly. This might be due to the complementary nature of these features, as well as the capacity of our approach to better integrate and exploit different sources of information.},

Image descriptors employed are extended 4D color co-occurrence matrices counting the occurrence of all possible pixel triplets located at the vertices of equilateral triangles of different size. The method is demonstrated on a sample of 952 histology images taken from 68 women with clinically confirmed diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

These cultures mimic various grades of breast cancer along the metastatic cascade. Particular proteins of interest are fluorescently labeled and subsequently imaged via multi-spectral confocal microscopy in order to analyze cellular organization and polarity between various tumor grades. A Fourier-based image registration method is employed to stitch the images, 3D watershed segmentation method is used to identify the ductal structures, and morphological image processing techniques are utilized to extract the features. In addition to capturing both expected and visually-differentiable changes, we quantify subtle differences that are challenging to assess by microscopic inspection. Support vector machine-based supervised learning achieves 69.4% and 79.0% accuracy in classifying the ductal structures into pre-cancerous, non-invasive ductal carcinoma, and invasive ductal carcinoma grades after 7 and 14 days in the cell cultures, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed features can be used to describe the effects of morphological changes to the functional changes of the cells along the metastatic cascade.},

The structure of these cells are quite complex and irregular, which makes segmentation and tracking even more challenging. We use a novel combination of Difference of Gaussians and a variant of the Watershed algorithm to segment cells accurately. Our tracking algorithm can identify not only the temporal path of the cells but also events like cell divisions and deaths. Our system is robust, efficient, completely automatic, and removes many drawbacks faced by earlier solutions. We also propose the first geometric algorithm that uses Delaunay triangulation, to find the number of the branches of the cells, which is an important biological feature.},

abstract = {In systems-based approaches for studying processes such as cancer and development, identifying and characterizing individual cells within a tissue is the first step towards understanding the large-scale effects that emerge from the interactions between cells. To this end, nuclear morphology is an important phenotype to characterize the physiological and differentiated state of a cell. This study focuses on using nuclear morphology to identify cellular phenotypes in thick tissue sections imaged using 3D fluorescence microscopy. The limited label information, heterogeneous feature set describing a nucleus, and existence of subpopulations within cell-types makes this a difficult learning problem. To address these issues, a technique is presented to learn a distance metric from labeled data which is locally adaptive to account for heterogeneity in the data. Additionally, a label propagation technique is used to improve the quality of the learned metric by expanding the training set using unlabeled data. Results are presented on images of tumor stroma in breast cancer, where the framework is used to identify fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells - three major stromal cells involved in carcinogenesis.},

Such amounts of memory raise major issues that prevent usual image representation models from being used. Moreover, using such high resolution images, global image features, such as tissues, do not clearly appear at full resolution. Such images contain thus different hierarchical information at different resolutions. This paper presents the model of tiled top-down pyramids which provides a framework to handle such images. This model encodes a hierarchy of partitions of large images defined at different resolutions. We also propose a generic construction scheme of such pyramids whose validity is evaluated on an histological image application.},

It will be shown, how the ultrafast electron dynamics in the nanoparticles can be exploited to precisely tailor their morphology and, hence, their optical properties. Afterwards, different synthesis techniques are explained and a variety of applications of noble metal nanoparticles will be discussed.After the introduction in the unique optical properties of noble metal nanoparticles, three dif-ferent physical preparation techniques are presented. For example, a new route for mass fabri-cation of metal nanoparticles with monodisperse shape and narrow size distribution in pure water [1]. For this purpose, we have combined pulsed laser ablation with the technique of selective laser tailoring. I demonstrate that we can easily narrow the width of the initially broad size distribution of the generated nanoparticles from \'{o} = 32% to \'{o} = 20% in a single irradiation step and without a significant change of the mean nanoparticle radius [1].In the second part of my talk, I demonstrate the preparation and tailoring of noble metal nanoparticles on substrates. Such tailored nanoparticles have a wide range of applications, for example in biosensing, confocal microscopy, or for surface enhanced spectroscopy tech-niques. Examples, were tailored gold and silver nanoparticles have been successfully applied for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy will be given [2].Finally, experiments aiming at a parallel generation of sub-diffraction sized nanostructures in fused silica will be presented. The key point of these experiments is the electromagnetic near field in the vicinity of highly ordered triangular nanoparticles on substrates, prepared by nanosphere lithography. The near field is exploited to overcome locally the abla-tion threshold of the fused silica sub-strate. For this purpose, supported trian-gular gold nanoparticle arrays have been irradiated with a single 35 fs pulse of a Ti:sapphire multipass amplifier (\"{e} = 790 nm). Depending on the laser fluence and polarisation direction, sub-diffraction sized nanostructures have been gener-ated [3]. An example of such a structure is displayed in figure 2. It shows nano-channels with a mean depth of 5 nm, a width of 95 nm, but with a length of up to 10 im.},

abstract = {The fast development of microscopy imaging techniques nowadays promotes the generation of a large amount of data. These data are very crucial not only for theoretical biomedical research but also for clinical usage. In order to decrease the inter-intra observer variability and save the human effort on labeling and classifying these images, a lot of research efforts have been devoted to the development of algorithms for biomedical images. Among such efforts, histology image classification is one of the most important areas due to its broad applications in pathological diagnosis such as cancer diagnosis. To improve classification accuracy, most of the previous work focuses on extracting more features and building algorithms for a specific task. This paper proposes a framework based on the novel and robust Collateral Representative Subspace Projection Modeling (C-RSPM) supervised classification model for general histology image classification. In the proposed framework, a cell image is first divided into 25 blocks to reduce the spatial complexity of computation, and one C-RSPM model is built on each block set which contains blocks in the same location from different images. For each testing image, our proposed framework first classifies each of its blocks using the C-RSPM classification model built for that block set, and then applies a multimodal late fusion algorithm with a weighted majority voting strategy to decide the final class label of the whole image. Experimenting using three-fold cross validation with three benchmark histology data sets shows that the proposed framework outperforms other well-known classifiers in the comparison and gives better results than the highest accuracy reported previously.},

According to the application status of low rank brown coals of Inner Mongolia, the fractal characteristics of particle size distribution function of raw brown coals and modified-brown coals were analyzed in the paper. The grain size analysis and microstructure analysis of coal samples were measured by the Euro-American gram LS-C (1) type laser Particle analytical instrument, Fourier infrared spectrum (FRIT) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The results of the study indicate that raw brown coals and modified-brown coals have fractal feature by using the mathematical model of fractal characteristics of particle size distribution function based on fractal theory. The paper provides the fractal dimensions of modified-brown coals increased with the rank of coal. Thus fractal dimensions can be used as an evaluation index of coal rank providing theoretical basis and distinguish basis for a further study on properties of modified-brown coals.},

In this paper, an approach based on the Poisson equation is proposed to extract the number of segments of nucleus in a more straightforward manner, and inner distances are used to represent the shape features of the nucleus segments. The experimental results show that the proposed approaches can extract the features efficiently. These important features can be added to the input feature set of neural networks or other classifiers to improve classification results of leukocytes in a blood smeared image.},

abstract = {Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the most common malignancy in American men. In 2010 there will be an estimated 217,730 new cases and 32,050 deaths from CAP in the US. The diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma is made exclusively from the histological evaluation of prostate tissue. The sampling protocols used to obtain 18 gauge (1.5 mm diameter) needle cores are standard sampling templates consisting of 6-12 cores performed in the context of an elevated serum value for prostate specific antigen (PSA). In this context, the prior probability of cancer is somewhat increased. However, even in this screened population, the efficiency of finding cancer is low at only approximately 20%. Histopathologists are faced with the task of reviewing the 5-10 million cores of tissue resulting from approximately 1,000,000 biopsy procedures yearly, parsing all the benign scenes from the worrisome scenes, and deciding which of the worrisome images are cancer.All prostate cancer is not biologically the same. Some cancers are progressive despite therapy and eventually kill the patient. Other cancers are indolent. Our ability to separate aggressive from indolent cancer is good but limited to population statistics describing the distribution of features such as tumor size, tumor stage, PSA value, and tumor grade. The Gleason grading system of CAP is the single most powerful feature for the prediction of outcome in CAP. The Gleason grading system recognizes 5 basic architectural patterns which structurally describe a disturbance of normal inter-glandular organizational relationships on a 2-10 scoring scale. The bins of score 6 or less; score 7; and score 8 or more have significantly different biological outcomes in meta-analysis. In assigning Gleason grade the accurate identification of Gleason patterns 4 and 5 is the most important task for the histopathologist. Inter-observer variance in the recognition of Gleason patterns 4/5 is an important limitation in grading. Educational programs can improve concordance across labs.Machine facilitated quantitative histoimaging with computer assisted diagnosis (HistoCAD) offers an algorithmic classifier approach to Gleason grading with the promise of near 100% reproducibility. Recent improvements in virtual slide scanning technology allow for ready access to whole slide digital images on which to focus computational solutions. There are, however, many challenges to effective HistoCAD programs.},

Instead, an efficient seeding approach is applied to find significant pixels almost certainly within complex neuronal structures and the tracing problem is solved by computing an graph tree structure connecting these seeds. In addition, an automated neuron comparison method is introduced for performance evaluation and structure analysis. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient.

abstract = {In this paper we present a Markov random field (MRF) driven region-based active contour model (MaRACel) for medical image segmentation. State-of-the-art region-based active contour (RAC) models assume that every spatial location in the image is statistically independent of the others, thereby ignoring valuable contextual information. To address this shortcoming we incorporate a MRF prior into the AC model, further generalizing Chan &amp; Vese's (CV) and Rousson and Deriche's (RD) AC models. This incorporation requires a Markov prior that is consistent with the continuous variational framework characteristic of active contours; consequently, we introduce a continuous analogue to the discrete Potts model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MaRACel, we compare its performance to those of the CV and RD AC models in the following scenarios: (1) the qualitative segmentation of a cancerous lesion in a breast DCE-MR image and (2) the qualitative and quantitative segmentations of prostatic acini (glands) in 200 histopathology images. Across the 200 prostate needle core biopsy histology images, MaRACel yielded an average sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 71%, 95%, 74% with respect to the segmented gland boundaries; the CV and RD models have corresponding values of 19%, 81%, 20% and 53%, 88%, 56%, respectively.},

Cell tracking is necessary for quantifying cell behaviors. However, the complex behaviors and similarity of individual cells in a dense population make the cell population tracking challenging. To deal with these challenges, we propose a novel tracking algorithm, in which the local neighboring information is introduced to distinguish the nearby cells with similar morphology, and the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filter is employed to compensate for cell migrations. Based on a similarity metric, integrating the local neighboring information, migration prediction, shape and intensity, the integer programming is used to achieve the most stable association between cells in two consecutive frames. We evaluated the proposed method on the high content screening assays of HeLa cancer cell populations, and achieved 92% average tracking accuracy.},

The first step is isolating the tissue by removing the background and red blood cells via color thresholding. Next, an iterative threshold technique is used to differentiate tissue from nuclei. Nuclei are further segmented to distinguish between nuclei which match morphological characteristics of PMLs and those which do not, such as connective tissue fibroblasts as well as chorion and amnion epithelium. Quantification of the remaining nuclei, many of which are likely neutrophils, are associated with amniotic fluid proteomic markers of infection and inflammation, as well as histological grading of neutrophils in amnion, chorion and decidua, and in the umbilical cord.},

abstract = {In order to improve the precision, speed, integration and reliability of the linear CCD system, which was used to detect the sub-pixel edge of picture, a new digital system based on auto focusing was designed. The system captures the image of the tested work piece through a CCD, puts the image data into computer, gathers coordinate of tested edge of work by the method of digital image processing and auto focusing. In order to meet the need of rapid and efficient measurement, the author studies the extraction technique of the moving edge. Depending on the feature of system, suitable space gradient operator and time gradient operator of the extraction of the moving edge are chosen. The experimental results demonstrated that defects within 40μm～1000μm were inspected effectively by the CCD scanning defects inspection instrument, and Good agreement was shown between defects images real-time reconstructed and optical microscopic images not only in shape but also in gray.},

abstract = {With the increasing use of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) probes as markers for certain genetic sequences, the requirement of a proper image processing framework is becoming a necessity to accurately detect these probe signal locations in relation to the centerline of the chromosome. Although many image processing techniques have been developed for chromosomal analysis, they fail to provide reliable results in segmenting and extracting the centerline of chromosomes due to the high variability in shape of chromosomes on microscope slides. In this paper we propose a hybrid algorithm that utilizes Gradient Vector Flow active contours, Discrete Curve Evolution based skeleton pruning and morphological thinning to provide a robust and accurate centerline of the chromosome, which is then used for the measurement of the FISH probe signals. The ability to accurately detect FISH probe locations with respective to the centerline and other landmarks can provide the cytogeneticists with detailed information that could lead to a faster diagnosis.},

abstract = {One way of evaluating muscle quality is to detennine its fiber type composition in histological sections. A complete muscle fiber type characterization system requires combining information from successive muscle histology images with different ATPase stain. Due to the local and global defonnations introduced in slide preparation process, a precise non-rigid registration is essential to construct the spatial correspondences between these successive images. This study proposes an approach for automated non-rigid registration of successive muscle histological sections. We propose a feature-based registration that uses a two stage approach: a rigid initialization followed by a non-rigid refinement. The rigid initialization step globally aligns successive tissue slides by finding correspondences between individually segmented muscle fibers using Fourier shape descriptors and computing the global rigid transformation using a voting scheme tolerant to mismatches. In the non-rigid stage we establish precise point correspondences using the nonnalized cross correlation metric and compute the non-rigid distortion using a polynomial transformation that minimizes the mean square distance between these control points.},

abstract = {We present a novel improvement of our previously published image analysis system for the automated localization and quantification of protein biomarker expression in immunofluorescence (IF) microscopic images. The improvement has been developed primarily for biopsy based images which are by nature of variable quality and heterogeneous. The innovative method is employed for discriminating the biomarker signal from background, where signal may be the expression of multiple biomarkers or counterstains used in IF. The method is dynamic and it derives a threshold for a true biomarker signal based on the relationship between disease and non-disease tissue components. In addition, a new dynamic range feature construction is presented that is less affected by processing and other variations in tissue. The utility of the approach is demonstrated in predicting, based on the diagnostic biopsy tissue, prostate cancer disease progression within eight years after a radical prostatectomy. For this purpose, androgen receptor (AR) and Ki67 biomarker expression in prostate biopsy samples was quantified and features from the proposed approach were shown to be associated with disease progression in a univariate analysis and manifested improved performance over prior systems. Furthermore, AR and Ki67 features were selected in a multivariate model integrating clinical, histological, and biomarker features, proving their independent prognostic value.},

In this direction, 9 different formulations varying in montmorillonite (MMT) and SEBS-g-MA contents were made. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to evaluate the effects of the Org-MMT and SEBS-g-MA additions on the structure of nanocomposites. XRD traces showed that the characteristic (001) peak of the nanocomposites shifted to the lower angle region. On the other hand, XRD and TEM results showed simultaneous existence exfoliated and intercalated structure in produced nanocomposites. The tensile properties and impact strength of these toughened nanocomposites are discussed in terms of the MMT and rubber contents and morphology. Adding of nanoclay enhanced and improved the stiffness properties (modulus and strength) of produced nanocomposites but reduced their toughness properties (impact strength). On the other hand, adding of SEBS-g-MA reduced stiffness properties but increase toughness properties. Hardness results analyzed and SEM micrograph considered in this project. As a main result, we gain access a best, optimum composition that which, there is a clear trade-off between stiffness/strength versus toughness/ductility, in this work.},

abstract = {The early identification of leukemia form in cancer patients can greatly increase the likelihood of recovery. Diagnostic methods that distinguish among the disease's many forms are either costly or do not exist. Amongst the existing diagnostic methods are immune-phenotype and cytogenetic abnormality, which require time to obtain results and are costly to perform due to their requirement of well equipped laboratories. Thus, there is a need for fast and cost-effective method that results in the identification of the different leukemia forms or types. Therefore, we propose the use of morphological analysis of microscopic images of leukemic blood cells for the identification purpose. We present in this paper the first phase of an automated leukemia form identification system, which is the segmentation of infected cell images. The segmentation process provides two enhanced images for each blood cell; containing the cytoplasm and the nuclei regions. Unique features for each form of leukemia can then be extracted from the two images and used for identification.},

Clustering of FTIR spectra has been done before, but this paper uses features instead of whole spectra or its second derivative. The resolution of FTIR spectroscopic image is not good enough, because pathologists need better resolution and different magnifications for current histopathologic recognition. When there is no way to compare the result of FTIR and light microscopic image at high resolution, it is also impossible to compare the results of clustering using FTIR spectroscopy. A computational histopathological method using both FTIR spectroscopy and light microscopic images is proposed in this study. Only important parts of tissue samples are measured using FTIR spectroscopy, which conserves time. Then the measured spectra is compared to preconceived spectral database. Spectral database is formed by measuring perfectly cultivated samples of tissue types using FTIR spectroscopy.},

Removal of asbestos from building materials and rendering it harmless are common means of alleviating asbestos hazards. Nevertheless, those processes necessitate a judgment of whether asbestos is included in building materials. According to the JIS standards, it is necessary to count 3000 particles in microscopic images. We consider the asbestos shape, and define a new feature obtained through frequency analysis. The proposed method intensifies the low-brightness asbestos using its feature, so it can detect not only high-brightness particles and asbestos but also low-brightness asbestos. We underscore the effectiveness of the method by comparing its results with results counted by an expert.},

abstract = {Particle detection and tracking methods generally assume a simplistic image model that is rarely valid when imaging biological processes in fluorescence microscopy. The tracking task may become nearly impossible when complex biological structures are visible and interfere with the signal of interest. To address this limitation we have adapted a source separation technique based on sparsity principles to the characteristics of fluorescent biological images. Since it allows the discrimination of objects with different morphologies, we present an approach to detect and track particles that exploits its results. The tracking algorithm resolves particles that temporarily aggregate by exploiting the proposed model of image. We prove in a real case the ability of the method to track numerous particles in a complex and dynamic background, something which was not feasible until now, hence offering new tools to document interactions between cellular compartments.},

Combining macroscopic flocculation effect with microscopic floc morphology, accurate quantitative description and interpretation of the flocculation process can be achieved to predict flocculation effect. Moreover, a new fractal dimension called fractal dimension of floc growth was proposed. Feasibility study on its competency of demonstrating the flocculation effect showed that the fractal dimension of floc growth could be used to characterize the variation of floc size and strength in flocculation process and that there was a good correlation between fractal dimension and residual turbidity at different turbidity of raw water. Thereby, the index, capable of reflecting the changes of flocculation effect can be used to optimize flocculation conditions, enhance flocculation efficiency, improve the quality of outflow and cut down the cost of water treatment.},

The samples were characterized by N2 isothermal adsorption/desorption method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that pyrolysis temperature had a notable impact on the pore structure and morphology of biomass char. Between 200 and 500 oC, the removal of a significant amount of volatile matter produced pore opening. Above 500oC, the loss of only a relatively small fraction of volatile matter caused the development of porosity and the occurrence of the structural shrinkage and pore narrowing. High temperature led to plastic deformation of particles resulting in smooth surfaces and large cavities. The surface area reached a maximum value at 500oC, and at higher temperatures, the specific area dropped significantly, probably due to thermal annealing. Char structural ordering was likely to be a mechanism for thermal annealing and thus for thermal deactivation.},

abstract = {Brain asymmetry has been a topic of interest for neuroscientists for many years. The advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows researchers to extend the study of asymmetry to a microscopic scale by examining fiber integrity differences across hemispheres rather than the macroscopic differences in shape or structure volumes. Even so, the power to detect these microarchitectural differences depends on the sample size and how the brain images are registered and how many subjects are studied. We fluidly registered 4 Tesla DTI scans from 180 healthy adult twins (45 identical and fraternal pairs) to a geometrically-centered population mean template. We computed voxelwise maps of significant asymmetries (left/right hemisphere differences) for common fiber anisotropy indices (FA, GA). Quantitative genetic models revealed that 47-62% of the variance in asymmetry was due to genetic differences in the population. We studied how these heritability estimates varied with the type of registration target (T1- or T2-weighted) and with sample size. All methods consistently found that genetic factors strongly determined the lateralization of fiber anisotropy, facilitating the quest for specific genes that might influence brain asymmetry and fiber integrity.},

The framework leverages the skeleton-based modeling of sheet-like WM fasciculi using the continuous medial representation, which gives a natural definition of thickness and supports its comparison across subjects. The thickness measure provides a macroscopic characterization of WM fasciculi that complements existing analysis of microstructural features. The utility of the framework is demonstrated in quantifying WM atrophy in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a severe neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons. We show that, compared to using microscopic features alone, combining the macroscopic and microscopic features gives a more holistic characterization of the disease.},

abstract = {The study of cell nuclei is fundamental for plant cell Biology research. To obtain information at cellular level, researchers image cells' nuclei which were modified with fluorescence proteins, through laser scanning confocal microscopy. These images are normally noisy and suffer from high background fluorescence, making grey-scale segmentation approaches inadequate for a usable detection. To obtain a successful detection even at low contrast we investigate the use of a particular convergence filter, the Symmetric Sliding Band filter (SSBF), for cell detection. This filter is based on gradient convergence and not intensity. As such it can detect low contrast cell nuclei which otherwise would be lost in the background noise. Due to the characteristics of cell nuclei morphology, a symmetry constrain is integrated in the filter which corrects some inadequate detections and results in a filter response that is more discriminative. We evaluate the use of this filter for cell nuclei detection on the &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; root tip, where the nuclei were stained using yellow fluorescence protein. The resulting cell nuclei detection precision is 89%.},

One of the necessary tasks is to segment the individual neurons. For this purpose, we propose a supervised learning approach to detect the cell membranes.

It is shown that using features from context positions allows for more information to be utilized in the classification. Together with the nonlinear discrimination ability of the AdaBoost classifier, this results in clearly noticeable improvements over previously used methods.},

abstract = {IVUS-derived virtual histology (VH) permits the assessment of atherosclerotic plaque morphology by using radiofrequency analysis of ultrasound signals. However, it requires the acquisition to be ECG-gated, which is a major limitation of VH. Indeed, its computation can only be performed once per cardiac cycle, which significantly decreases the longitudinal resolution of VH. To overcome this limitation, the introduction of an image-based plaque characterization is of great importance. Current IVUS image processing techniques do not allow adequate identification of the coronary artery plaques. This can be improved by defining appropriate features for the different kinds of plaques. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method based on Run-length algorithm is presented and used for improving the automated characterization of the plaques within the IVUS images. The proposed feature extraction method is applied to 200 IVUS images obtained from five patients. As a result an accuracy rate of 77% was achieved. Comparing this to the accuracy rates of 75% and 71% obtained using co-occurrence and local binary pattern methods respectively indicates the superior performance of the proposed feature extraction method.},

abstract = {Spindle-shaped lead selenide (PbSe) nanocrystals were synthesized by solution processing synthetic method for the first time. The prepared PbSe nanocrystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and near-infrared absorption spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction pattern shows that the synthesized PbSe nanocrystals have cubic rock salt structure. Spindle-shaped PbSe nanocrystals are formed by spontaneous alignment and fusion of small quasi-spherical PbSe nanoparticles, namely, oriented attachment. It is believed that the relative strength between steric hindrance force caused by capping molecules and orientation force caused by the dipole moment determined the growth process and final morphologies of nanocrystals. If the orientation force along some axes can overcome the steric hindrance force, the small PbSe nanocrystals with certain size distribution will self-assemble and evolve to spindle-shaped PbSe nanocrystals. If not, the small PbSe nanocrystals will grow individually to bigger quasi-spherical PbSe nanocrystals. Four discrete absorption peaks appear in the near-infrared absorption spectrum of synthesized PbSe nanocrystals due to the quantum confinement effects.},

With these candidates, a polygon (triangle, rectangle or other polygons) is composed. Compared to the state-of-the-art shape detection algorithms, PDA is much faster and it can detect any polygons such as triangles, rectangles, etc. We introduce PDA to a 6DOFs robot visual servoing platform and the experimental results show that significant improvements in time efficiency and performance robustness of the proposed algorithm have been achieved.},

Firstly, it is assumed that the complexity of biological processes can be usefully replicated artificially by abstracting a relatively few key or essential characteristics from the biological system. Secondly, it is often assumed that a single entity, the neuron, is solely responsible for biological cognitive processing or computation. Thirdly, it is also often assumed that this processing is entirely dependant on microscopic factors within the neuron. Recent research using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) has addressed the first assumption, highlighting that emphasizing alternative biological functionality may afford massive computational gain. In an attempt to address the last two assumptions, the authors propose that the glial network may be acting as a feature extraction network in a way that is similar to the function of a reservoir computer.},

abstract = {Cell adhesion and spreading within the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in cell motility, cell growth and tissue organization. Measuring cell spreading dynamics enables the investigation of cell mechanosensitivity to external mechanical stimuli, such as substrate rigidity. A common approach to measure cell spreading dynamics is to take time lapse images and quantify cell size and perimeter as a function of time. In our experiments, differences in cell characteristics between different treatments are subtle and require accurate measurements of cell parameters across a large population of cells to ensure an adequate sample size for statistical hypothesis testing. This paper presents a new approach to estimate accurate cell boundaries with complex shapes by applying a modified geodesic active contour level set method that directly utilizes the halo effect typically seen in phase contrast microscopy. Contour evolution is guided by edge profiles in a perpendicular direction to ensure convergence to the correct cell boundary. The proposed approach is tested on bovine aortic endothelial cell images under different treatments, and demonstrates accurate segmentation for a wide range of cell sizes and shapes compared to manual ground truth.},

abstract = {Segmentation of vessels in biomedical images is important as it can provide insight into analysis of vascular morphology, topology and is required for kinetic analysis of flow velocity and vessel permeability. Intravital microscopy is a powerful tool as it enables &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;imaging of both vasculature and circulating cells. However, the analysis of vasculature in those images is difficult due to the presence of cells and their image gradient. In this paper, we provide a novel method of segmenting vessels with a high level of cell related clutter. A set of virtual point pairs ("vessel probes") are moved reacting to forces including Vessel Vector Flow (VVF) and Vessel Boundary Vector Flow (VBVF) forces. Incorporating the cell detection, the VVF force attracts the probes toward the vessel, while the VBVF force attracts the virtual points of the probes to localize the vessel boundary without being distracted by the image features of the cells. The vessel probes are moved according to Newtonian Physics reacting to the net of forces applied on them. We demonstrate the results on a set of five real &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;images of liver vasculature cluttered by white blood cells. When compared against the ground truth prepared by the technician, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of segmentation with VVF and VBVF was 55% lower than the method without VVF and VBVF.},

abstract = {Topography variation has a significant impact on performance as well as printability for nanometer technologies. In this paper, we propose an improved full-chip routing system for reducing Cu CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) &amp; ECP (Electroplating) topology variation, in which CMP aware global routing, CMP aware layer assignment and ECP aware detailed routing are integrated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider both Cu CMP and ECP variation all through routing procedure. First, a Cu CMP and ECP topology model considering both perimeter density and feature density is used in global routing, layer assignment and detailed routing to guide the whole optimization procedure. Second, a W-shape multilevel routing model is applied to fully control topology variation from a macroscopic level to a microscopic level. Third, layer assignment which plays a key role in trading off the density between interlayer and intralayer, is integrated into the multilevel routing system and a fast simulated annealing based algorithm is presented to take additive effect on multiple layers into consideration. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can reduce 6%-7% post-ECP variation and 15%-17% post-CMP variation on average than CMP-aware detailed routing algorithm in [5]. Furthermore, it can insert smaller amount (about 5%) of dummy fill, which means less impact on performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use real terrain elevation data and the microscopic terrain feature unit to synthesize the macroscopic terrain flexibly and effectively. An interactive system provides users a convenient and intuitive interface to profile microscopic terrain features using terrain primitives. A number of terrain primitives, geometric objects such as prism-like, tetrahedron-like, and cone-like objects regarded as the concept representation object of microscopic terrain features, can be transformed to construct the terrain profile. Then, these terrain primitives are replaced by matching terrain units searched from real terrain elevation database to seamlessly synthesize the macroscopic terrain, the landform. As experimental results show, the resultant efficient synthesized terrains are realistic, fitting user's intuition.},

abstract = {The microstructures of sesame cake under five applied pressures were measured using stereo light microscope and Image-pro software. Fractal dimensions of pore section border and pore size distribution were measured and calculated by the slit island process. Regression method was used to analyse the correlation between the fractal dimension and applied pressure. Results showed that the fractal characteristic of pore structure of sesame cake was obvious, the pore structure and its fractal dimension were significantly affected by applied pressure. There existed good linear correlations between applied pressure and fractal dimensions of the pore section border and pore size distribution. Their fractal dimension values decreased significantly with increasing applied pressure. It was concluded that with increasing applied pressure the pore section border is further twisty, the pore wall further rough, the pore shape further irregular and the pore size distribution further complicated.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a model for content-based retrieval of histopathology images. The most remarkable characteristic of the proposed model is that it is able to extract high-level features that reflect the semantic content of the images. This is accomplished by a semantic mapper that maps conventional low-level features to high-level features using state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques. The semantic mapper is trained using images labeled by a pathologist. The system was tested on a collection of 1502 histopathology images and the performance assessed using standard measures. The results show an improvement from a 67% of average precision for the first result, using low-level features, to 80% of precision using high-level features.},

abstract = {Many hearing aid users experience physical discomfort when wearing their device. The main contributor to this problem is believed to be deformation of the ear and ear canal caused by movement of the mandible. Physical discomfort results from added pressure on soft tissue areas in the ear. Identifying features that can predict potential deformation is therefore important for identifying problematic cases in advance. A study on the physical deformation of the human ear and canal due to movement of the mandible is presented. The study is based on laser scannings of 30 pairs of ear impressions from 9 female and 21 male subjects. Two impressions have been taken from each subject, one with open mouth, and one with the mouth closed. All impressions are registered using non-rigid surface registration and a shape model is built. From each pair of impressions a deformation field is generated and propagated to the shape model, enabling the building of a deformation model in the reference frame of the shape model. A relationship between the two models is established, showing that the shape variation can explain approximately 50% of the variation in the deformation model. An hypothesis test for significance of the deformations for each deformation field reveals that all subjects have significant deformation at Tragus and in the canal. Furthermore, a relation between the magnitude of the deformation and the gender of the subject is demonstrated. The results are successfully validated by comparing the outcome to the anatomy by using a single set of high resolution histological sectionings of the region of interest.},

An image processing-based fish disease diagnosis system was developed, allowing for earlier treatment of infected fish to prevent the spread of disease. The system is composed of three steps: 1) extracting pathogen area from the microscopic images of infected fish tissue by applying various kinds of image processing such as noise reduction, edge detection, morphological operations, background extraction, and object detection, 2) confirming pathogen and making final diagnosis by feature extraction, correlation matching and statistical pattern matching compared to the registered pathogen database, and 3) sending a message about diagnosed disease and treatment method to the fish farmers on their mobile phones after sorting out appropriate treatment methods by searching drug information database. Experimental results show that the proposed system is more convenient, consistent, and rapid to diagnosis fish disease rather than general diagnosis method.},

Based on previous work regarding cell recognition in bright-field images, we propose an approach to the automated recognition of unstained live Drosophila cells, which are of high biological relevance. In order to achieve this goal, the original methods were extended to enable the additional application of an alternative microscopy technique, since the exclusive usage of bright-field images does not allow for an accurate segmentation of the considered cells. In order to cope with the increased number of parameters to be set, a genetic algorithm is applied. Furthermore, the employed segmentation and classification techniques needed to be adapted to the new cell characteristics. Therefore, a modified active contour approach and an enhanced feature set, allowing for a more detailed description of the obtained segments, are introduced.},

Our main purpose is to assess the degree of variability of folding of the chromatin fiber, measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization, using BAC probes in combination with 3D confocal microscopy. We employ point-based registration, the complex Bingham distribution, generalized Procrustes method, and the Kendall spherical coordinate system. The approaches have been applied using 337 3D multi-channel microscopy images. We have analyzed the geometric structure formed by gene-rich highly expressed genomic regions and areas that are gene-poor and have a low transcriptional activity. It turned out that the structure formed by these genomic regions exhibit high shape variation, however, most of them can be characterized by a non-uniform shape distribution.},

High fluence irradiation induces viscous oxide flow and push-in of the surface islands into the oxide substrate.

Because the microstructure pattern of starches in starchnoodles depends mainly on a kind or blend of starches from which the starch-noodle was made, this paper presents an approach to classify the starch-noodles by using computer system automatically based on recognizing the microstructure pattern of the starches and components in starch-noodle. The method consists of three step: 1) take the micrograph of starch-noodles with scanning electron microscopy and preprocessing. 2) extract features of fractal geometry and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence from micrograph. 3) distinguish a sort of starch-noodles by using these combined features as input vector of artificial neural networks. The experiments has been conducted with starch-noodles of mungbean blending pachyrhizus, and the experimental results show that the method is practicable and effective.},

abstract = {The efficient detection and quantification of rolling leukocytes within intravital microscopy is of both theoretical and practical interest. Currently, methods exist for tracking rolling leukocytes in vivo which rely on manual detection of the cells. In this paper, a new technique inspired by the teardrop shape of the rolling leukocytes is presented for accurately detecting rolling leukocytes. It is based on a feature score, the gradient inverse coefficient of variation (GICOV), which serves to discriminate rolling leukocytes from a cluttered environment. The leukocyte detection process consists of three sequential steps: The first step utilizes a novel teardrop shape matching algorithm to coarsely identify the leukocytes by finding the leukocytes resembling teardrops with a locally maximal GICOV. Second and third steps involve evolution of B-spline snake starting from each of the teardrops found in the first step to refine the leukocytes boundaries and associated GICOV score, and retaining contours with high GICOV scores. The detection process is observed to yield superior results compared to other methods currently in use. The deformation information inherent in the teardrop shapes gives valuable information about the extent to which the cells are adhering to the endothelium.},

abstract = {To study the tissue repair around the textured mammary implants under the action of papain (PA). Methods: Thirty-six Wistar rats were evaluated and randomly distributed into two groups (n = 18): papain (PA) and control (CT). Each group was equally distributed into 3 subgroups (n = 6) and observed on seventh, thirtieth-fifth and ninth pos-operative days. Each animal received a textured implant in the left dorso-axillary region (sham - SH), on were instilled 0.5 mL saline solution 0.9%, and another textured implant on the right dorso-axillary region (papain - PA), on were instilled 0.5 mL of water-soluble solution of papain. The control group (CT) received only textured implant in the left dorso-axillary region with prior instillation of 0.5 mL of saline solution 0.9%. The histological analysis of the 3 subgroups was carried out using picrosirius-red stain and an image analyzing system using the Image Pro Plus™ program to evaluate the thickness and maturation and deposition of collagen fibers. Immunohistochemical evaluation was performed, using micrometric reticules of Weiss (Olympus Labstore™), for myofibroblasts counting only in the 90th day subgroup. Results: At 35th and 90th days, the papain group (PA) presented reduction on the fibrous capsule thickness around the implant, in the number of collagen fibers and myofibroblasts, comparing to the control group (CT). Conclusion: The papain drug decreased the fibrous capsule formation around the textured silicon implants in rats.},

The textures and the PTTs of pure CP have been studied using the supplementary techniques of Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Polarising Microscopy Studies (PMS). The absorption of the sample in the visible range was found using Ultra-Violet visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS). The infrared absorption was also studied using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results of the above investigations are being presented here. Addition of azobenzene dye to pure CP decreased its clearing temperature from 88°C to 62.8°C. A comparative study between the systems, with and without azodye, showed that the addition of azobenzene dye brought about a change in the PMS textures indicating a change in the birefringence properties. Further, the clearing temperature also varied with different concentrations of PMMA in the mixture of CP + azodye; the clearing temperature was maximum (77.5°C) for the sample which contains 80%CP+20%PMMA+1% Azodye). Results of the UV/VIS analysis, FTIR analysis are also presented and discussed in this paper.},

Second, these traditional methods cannot exactly locate the position of each grain in the image. Third, the running cost of these methods on PC is too high to implement an online application. This paper proposes a granular analysis model based on improved watershed which is called varying-ladder watershed. The improved watershed overcomes the over-segment problem by adjusting the ladder height among successive steps and quickly segments the whole image into regions of different textures. Experiments show that using the proposed method gets accurate and detailed results and gains high computational performance.},

This technology assists learners in learning about chemical units, such as “mole number”, “atomic weight” and “molecular weight”, to understand the composition and characteristics of matter. The concepts of this unit are relatively abstract, so the characteristics of AR combined with learners’ life experience can present the world of microscopic particles, which are invisible to the naked eye and complex and abstract, enabling learners to establish correct rules and imagine the microscopic particle world properly and paving a smooth way for future chemistry learning.},

Differential diagnosis of NSCLC into adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is important because of prognosis. Histological images are taken from a database consisting of 72 lung tissue samples collected indigenously with a core needle biopsy. In this work, a novel method has been developed where the features of ADC and SCC for a histological image are taken from various statistical and mathematical models implemented on the coefficients of the wavelet transform of an image. The method provides a precision of 95.1% and 96.2% in classifying malignant and non-malignant tissue type respectively. This methodology of classifying ADC and SCC without coding clinical diagnostic features into the system is a necessary step forward towards an autonomous decision system.},

abstract = {Image processing and pattern recognition offer a useful and versatile method for optically characterizing drops of a colloidal solution during the drying process and in its final state. This paper exploits image processing techniques applied to cross-polarizing microscopy to probe birefringence and the bright-field microscopy to examine the morphological patterns. The bio-colloidal solution of interest is a mixture of water, liquid crystal (LC) and three different proteins [lysozyme (Lys), myoglobin (Myo), and bovine serum albumin (BSA)], all at a fixed relative concentration. During the drying process, the LC phase separates and becomes optically active detectable through its birefringence. Further, as the protein concentrates, it forms cracks under strain due to the evaporation of water. The mean intensity profile of the drying process is examined using an automated image processing technique that reveals three unique regimes- a steady upsurge, a speedy rise, and an eventual saturation. The high values of standard deviation show the complexity, the roughness, and inhomogeneity of the image surface. A semi-automated image processing technique is proposed to quantify the distance between the consecutive cracks by converting those into high contrast images. The outcome of the image analysis correlates with the initial state of the mixture, the nature of the proteins, and the mechanical response of the final patterns. The paper reveals new insights on the self-assembly of the macromolecules during the drying mechanism of any aqueous solution.},

abstract = {This work focuses on the quality assessment of agricultural product based on microscopic image, generated by Foldscope. Microscopic image-based food quality assessment always be an efficient method, but its system complexity, costly, bulk size and requirement of special expertise confines it usability. To encounter such issues, Foldscope which is small, lightweight, cheap and easy to use has been considered to verify its usability as food quality assessment device. In this purpose, measuring starch of potato has been selected to check its compatibility and microscopic images are taken from two image modalities—conventional microscope and Foldscope and the results have been compared. The image processing techniques including morphological filtering followed by Otsu’s method has been employed to detect starch efficiently. In total, 20 images from each of the system have been captured. Following the experiment, the presence of starch (in %) estimated based on the image taken from microscope and Foldscope are 23.50 ± 0.79 and 24.29 ± 0.73 respectively, which is consistent. Such results reveal that the Foldscope can be used in food quality assessment system, which could make such devices simple, portable and handy.},

abstract = {This visualization of the quantum-mechanical process of photosynthesis involved combining structural models from atomic, protein, organelle, and cell scales. We descend into a prehistoric hot spring, revealing primitive bacteria which use an early form of photosynthesis to turn sunlight into chemical energy in structures called chromatophores. This fulldome animation follows the energy through progressively more stable forms: a captured photon, electronic excitation, pumped protons, and finally, synthesis of ATP molecules. The team used VMD, a GPU-accelerated molecular visualization tool, to create geometric abstractions from a 5-million-atom static snapshot of the scientific research model. To achieve an organic flight path through the 3D data, they adapted their Virtual Director camera choreography software to interface with VMD. In Houdini, they choreographed particle effects which were then exported to VMD for rendering of the hero chromatophore. Nine more layers were rendered in Houdini's Mantra, including 500,000 instanced chromatophores and particle effects, 300 high-resolution cell membranes, and depth passes to control luminance and depth effects. The visualization treatments from Houdini and VMD were combined in Nuke for a seamless flight through this dynamic microscopic light show.},

In this paper, an automatic MN identification approach using medical hyperspectral microscopic images is developed.

abstract = {The research on rare cells makes a significant contribution to biology research and medical treatment for the application of diagnostic operation as well as prognoses treatment. Therefore, sorting them from heterogeneous mixtures is crucial and valuable. Traditional cell sorting methods featured with poor purity and recovery rate as well as limited flexibility, which are not ideal approaches for rare type. In this paper, we proposed a cell screening method based on automated microrobotic aspiration-and-placement strategy under fluorescence microscope. An innovative autofocusing visual feedback (AVF) method is proposed for precise three-dimensional (3D) locating of target cells. For depth detection, multiple depth from defocus (MDFD) method is adopted to solve symmetry problem and attain an average accuracy of 97.07%. For planar locating, Markov random field (MRF) based locating method is utilized to separate and locate the overlapped cells. The end actuator locating and real-time tracking are performed relying on normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method. Experiential results show that our system collects rare cells (100 cells ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) at a speed of 5 cells min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; with 90% purity and 75% recovery rate, which is valuable for biological and medical application.},

This is followed by a discussion of how the study findings could influence design features in new large scale digital musical instruments to result in more nuanced control and timbrally rich instruments, and better understanding of how interfaces and instruments influence performers’ choices and as a result music repertoire and performance.},

The 3 zones were validated using collagen-sensitive histological slides co-registered with MR images.

abstract = {The existing studies have demonstrated that the integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data can hold great promise for survival analysis of cancers. However, direct combination of multi-modal data may bring irrelevant or redundant features that will harm the prognosis performance. Therefore, it has become a challenge to select informative features from the derived heterogeneous data for survival analysis. Most existing feature selection methods only utilized the collected multi-modal data and survival information to identify a subset of relevant features, which neglect to use the diagnosis information to guide the feature selection process. In fact, the diagnosis information (e.g., TNM stage) indicates the extent of the disease severity that are highly correlated with the patients’ survival. Accordingly, we propose a diagnosis-guided multi-modal feature selection method (DGM2FS) for prognosis prediction. Specifically, we make use of the task relationship learning framework to automatically discover the relations between the diagnosis and prognosis tasks, through which we can identify important survival-associated image and eigengenes features with the help of diagnosis information. In addition, we also consider the association between the multi-modal data and use a regularization term to capture the correlation between the image and eigengene data. Experimental results on a lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset imply that incorporating diagnosis information can help identify meaningful survival-associated features, by which we can achieve better prognosis prediction performance than the conventional methods.},

abstract = {Reconstruction of 3D neuronal populations from optical microscopy images is essential to investigate neural pathways and functions. This task is challenging because of the low signal-to-noise ratio and non-continuous intensities of neurite segments in optical microscopy images. Recently, significant improvement has been made on neuron reconstruction due to the development of deep neural networks (DNNs). Training such a DNN usually relies on a large number of images with voxel-wise annotations, and annotating these 3D images is very costly in terms of both finance and labor. In this paper, we propose a progressive learning strategy to take advantages of both traditional neuron tracing methods and deep learning techniques. Traditional neuron tracing techniques, which do not require expensive manual annotations for dense neurites, are employed to produce pseudo labels for neuron voxels. With the pseudo labels, a deep segmentation network is trained to learn discriminative and comprehensive features for neuron voxel extraction from noisy backgrounds. The neuron tracing module and the segmentation network can be mutually complemented and progressively improved to reconstruct more complete neuronal populations without using manual annotations. Moreover, we build a dataset called “VISoR-40” that consists of 40 optical microscopy 3D images from mouse cortical regions to demonstrate the superior performance of our progressive learning method. This dataset will be available at  to support further study of deep learning techniques for brain exploration.},

However, it still has some challenges such as difficulty in segmenting the overlapping or touching nuclei, and limited ability of generalization to different organs and tissue types. In this paper, we propose a novel nuclei segmentation approach based on a two-stage learning framework and Deep Layer Aggregation (DLA). We convert the original binary segmentation task into a two-step task by adding nuclei-boundary prediction (3-classes) as an intermediate step. To solve our two-step task, we design a two-stage learning framework by stacking two U-Nets. The first stage estimates nuclei and their coarse boundaries while the second stage outputs the final fine-grained segmentation map. Furthermore, we also extend the U-Nets with DLA by iteratively merging features across different levels. We evaluate our proposed method on two public diverse nuclei datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms many standard segmentation architectures and recently proposed nuclei segmentation methods, and can be easily generalized across different cell types in various organs.},

abstract = {Fixation is essential for preserving cellular morphology in biomedical research. However, it may also affect spectra captured in multispectral fluorescence microscopy, impacting molecular interpretations. To investigate fixation effects on tissue, multispectral fluorescence microscopy images of pairs of samples with and without fixation are captured. Each pixel might exhibit overlapping spectra, creating a blind source separation problem approachable with linear unmixing. With multiple excitation wavelengths, unmixing is intuitively extended to tensor factorizations. Yet these approaches are limited by nonlinear effects like attenuation. Further, light exposure during image acquisition introduces subtle Brownian motion between image channels of non-fixed tissue. Finally, hypothesis testing for spectral differences due to fixation is non-trivial as retrieved spectra are paired sequential samples. To these ends, we present three contributions, (1) a novel robust non-negative tensor factorization using the -divergence and -norm, which decomposes the data into a low-rank multilinear and group-sparse non-multilinear tensor without making any explicit nonlinear modeling choices or assumptions on noise statistics; (2) a diffeomorphic atlas-based strategy for motion correction; (3) a non-parametric hypothesis testing framework for paired sequential data using functional principal component analysis. PyTorch code for robust non-negative tensor factorization is available at .},

Deep learning methods may perform to segment individual cells if they use sufficient training data that the boundary of each cell is annotated. However, it is very time-consuming for preparing such detailed annotation for many cell culture conditions.

We demonstrated the efficacy of our method using several data-set including multiple cell types captured by several types of microscopy. Our method achieved the highest accuracy compared with several conventional methods. In addition, we demonstrated that our method can perform without any annotation by using fluorescence images that cell nuclear were stained as training data. Code is publicly available in .},

abstract = {The research on content-based histopathological image retrieval (CBHIR) has become popular in recent years. CBHIR systems provide auxiliary diagnosis information for pathologists by searching for and returning regions that are contently similar to the region of interest (ROI) from a pre-established database. To retrieve diagnostically relevant regions from a database that consists of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs) for query ROIs is challenging and yet significant for clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel CBHIR framework for regions retrieval from WSI-database based on hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs). Compared to the present CBHIR framework, the structural information of WSI is preserved by the proposed model, which makes the retrieval framework more sensitive to regions that are similar in tissue distribution. Moreover, benefited from the hierarchical GNN structures, the proposed framework is scalable for both the size and shape variation of ROIs. It allows the pathologist defining the query region using free curves. Thirdly, the retrieval is achieved by binary codes and hashing methods, which makes it very efficient and thereby adequate for practical large-scale WSI-database. The proposed method is validated on a lung cancer dataset and compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method achieved precisions above 82.4% in the irregular region retrieval task, which are superior to the state-of-the-art methods. The average time of retrieval is 0.514 ms.},

abstract = {Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade of histopathology images is a crucial indicator in cervical biopsy results. Accurate CIN grading of epithelium regions helps pathologists with precancerous lesion diagnosis and treatment planning. Although an automated CIN grading system has been desired, supervised training of such a system would require a large amount of expert annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect. In this paper, we investigate the CIN grade classification problem on segmented epithelium patches. We propose to use conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to expand the limited training dataset, by synthesizing realistic cervical histopathology images. While the synthetic images are visually appealing, they are not guaranteed to contain meaningful features for data augmentation. To tackle this issue, we propose a synthetic-image filtering mechanism based on the divergence in feature space between generated images and class centroids in order to control the feature quality of selected synthetic images for data augmentation. Our models are evaluated on a cervical histopathology image dataset with limited number of patch-level CIN grade annotations. Extensive experimental results show a significant improvement of classification accuracy from 66.3% to 71.7% using the same ResNet18 baseline classifier after leveraging our cGAN generated images with feature based filtering, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our models.},

abstract = {Reconstructed terabyte and petabyte electron microscopy image volumes contain fully-segmented neurons at resolutions fine enough to identify every synaptic connection. After manual or automatic reconstruction, neuroscientists want to extract wiring diagrams and connectivity information to analyze the data at a higher level. Despite significant advances in image acquisition, neuron segmentation, and synapse detection techniques, the extracted wiring diagrams are still quite coarse, and often do not take into account the wealth of information in the densely reconstructed volumes. We propose a synapse-aware skeleton generation strategy to transform the reconstructed volumes into an information-rich yet abstract format on which neuroscientists can perform biological analysis and run simulations. Our method extends existing topological thinning strategies and guarantees a one-to-one correspondence between skeleton endpoints and synapses while simultaneously generating vital geometric statistics on the neuronal processes. We demonstrate our results on three large-scale connectomic datasets and compare against current state-of-the-art skeletonization algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel algorithm that achieves high performance in leukocytes detection and segmentation in microscopic blood sample images. To the best of our knowledge, this algorithm is the first that exploits the correlation between two CMYK and RGB color models. Our proposed algorithm uses the upper and lower limits of the pixel intensity in the Magenta component from the CMYK color space to adjust the image contrast in the Green component of the RGB image to segment the nuclei without any pre-processing steps. The proposed algorithm was tested using a series of 30 blood sample images with different color tones, image resolutions, magnifications, and surrounding conditions. The segmented nuclei are virtually congruent to the nuclei in the original image, in term of shape and area, regardless of the type of nucleus. The overall segmentation accuracy achieved by the proposed algorithm is 98.99%, with a consistent performance for the same image resolution regardless of the number of nucleus in the blood smear image. Our algorithm can be seen as a stepping stone for efficient implementations of nucleus classification to identify and classify the type of leukocyte for accurate medical diagnosis.},

abstract = {Microscopic traffic simulation has become an important tool to investigate traffic efficiency and road safety. In order to produce meaningful results, driver behaviour models need to be carefully calibrated to represent real world conditions. If this type of simulations are to be used to evaluate safety features of traffic, on top of macroscopic relationships such as the speed-density diagram, they should also adequately represent the average risk of accidents occurring on the road. In this paper, we present a two-stage computationally feasible multi-objective calibration process. The first stage performs a parameter sensitivity analysis to select only parameters with considerable effect on the respective objective functions. The second stage employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm utilizing only few influential parameters that produces a front of Pareto optimal solutions with respect to the conflicting objective functions. Compared to traditional methods which focus on only one objective while sacrificing the accuracy of the other, our method achieves a high degree of realism for both traffic flow and average risk.},

abstract = {To execute efficient and precise handling tasks in micro world, a bilateral system which connects the micro and macro worlds in both directions has been developed. In order to improve the work efficiency, 3-dimensional observation of objects in the micro world is necessary. Two images with parallax are necessary for the 3-D observation, but it is difficult to obtain these images under a microscope. In addition, in order for the operator to presence an accurate operation, it is necessary to have an operation that is realistic and does not make the operator feel uncomfortable. In this research, we proposed a method of obtaining parallax images by inserting a glass plate under the microscope, tilting the plate and thus changing the optical path by a small distance. In addition, in order to electrically control the tilt of the glass plate, we developed a swinging actuator driven by voice coils. Furthermore, the characteristics of this device are measured and evaluated. In addition, the micro force plate is prototyped by us. This is a device that detects six-axis force from a three-axis tactile sensor. The values obtained from the devices actually created are summarized in a table and evaluated.},

To address the challenging problems in current biomedical data science, we proposed several novel large-scale machine learning models for multi-dimensional data integration, heterogeneous multi-task learning, longitudinal feature learning, etc. Meanwhile, to deal with the big data computations, we proposed new asynchronous distributed stochastic gradient and coordinate descent methods for efficiently solving convex and non-convex problems, and also parallelized the deep learning optimization algorithms with layer-wise model parallelism. We applied our new large-scale machine learning models to analyze the multi-modal and longitudinal Electronic Medical Records (EMR) for predicting the heart failure patients' readmission and drug side effects, integrate the neuroimaging and genome-wide array data to recognize the phenotypic and genotypic biomarkers, and detect the histopathological image markers and the multi-dimensional cancer genomic biomarkers in precision medicine studies.},

abstract = {In recent years, histopathology images have been increasingly used as a diagnostic tool in the medical field. The process of accurately diagnosing a biopsy sample requires significant expertise in the field, and as such can be time-consuming and is prone to uncertainty and error. With the advent of digital pathology, using image recognition systems to highlight problem areas or locate similar images can aid pathologists in making quick and accurate diagnoses. In this paper, we specifically consider the encoded local projections (ELP) algorithm, which has previously shown some success as a tool for classification and recognition of histopathology images. We build on the success of the ELP algorithm as a means for image classification and recognition by proposing a modified algorithm which captures the local frequency information of the image. The proposed algorithm estimates local frequencies by quantifying the changes in multiple projections in local windows of greyscale images. By doing so we remove the need to store the full projections, thus significantly reducing the histogram size, and decreasing computation time for image retrieval and classification tasks. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of applying our method to histopathology images which have been digitally separated into their hematoxylin and eosin stain components. The proposed algorithm is tested on the publicly available invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) data set. The histograms are used to train an SVM to classify the data. The experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms the original ELP algorithm in image retrieval tasks. On classification tasks, the results are found to be comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning methods and better than many handcrafted features from the literature.},

In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework of Inception-V3 network to classify well, moderately and poorly differentiated cervical histopathology images, which are stained using immunohistochemistry methods. In this framework, an Inception-V3 based transfer learning structure is first built up. Then, a fine-tuning approach is applied to extract effective deep learning features from the structure. Finally, the extracted features are designed for the final classification. In the experiment, a practical images stained by AQP, HIF and VEGF approaches are applied to test the proposed transfer learning network, and an average accuracy of 77.3% is finally achieved.},

The security of IoBT is one of the more challenging aspects, where adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities in IoBT software and deployment conditions to gain insight into their state. In this work, we look into the security of IoBT from the lens of cyber deception. First, we formulate the IoBT domain as a graph learning problem from an adversarial point of view and introduce various tools through which an adversary can learn the graph starting with partial prior knowledge. Second, we use this model to show that an adversary can learn high-level information from low-level graph structures, including the number of soldiers and their proximity. For that, we use a powerful n-gram based algorithm to obtain features from random walks on the underlying graph representation of IoBT. Third, we provide microscopic and macroscopic approaches that manipulate the underlying IoBT graph structure to introduce uncertainty in the adversary’s learning. Finally, we show our approach’s effectiveness through analyses and evaluations.},

abstract = {Pattern formation is a ubiquitous phenomenon that describes the generation of orderly outcomes by self-organization. In both physical society and online social media, patterns formed by social interactions are mainly driven by information flow. Despite an increasing number of studies aiming to understand the spreads of information flow, little is known about the geometry of these spreading patterns and how they were formed during the spreading. In this paper, by exploring 432 million information flow patterns extracted from a large-scale online social media dataset, we uncover a wide range of complex geometric patterns characterized by a three-dimensional metric space. In contrast, the existing understanding of spreading patterns are limited to fanning-out or narrow tree-like geometries. We discover three key ingredients that govern the formation of complex geometric patterns of information flow. As a result, we propose a stochastic process model incorporating these ingredients, demonstrating that it successfully reproduces the diverse geometries discovered from the empirical spreading patterns. Our discoveries provide a theoretical foundation for the microscopic mechanisms of information flow, potentially leading to wide implications for prediction, control and policy decisions in social media.},

The model so trained is further subjected to transfer learning, to correctly classify cancerous pattern from non-cancerous conditions, in a supervised manner. Our experiments were carried out in two phases. Phase-I investigates the effect of data augmentation applied on minority class for the Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 pre-trained networks. Results of phase-I are further enhanced in phase-II by the transfer learning approach in which features extracted from all layers of Inception-v3 are learnt by the SVM and weighted SVM classifiers. From experimental results, it was found that the pre-trained Inception-v3 model with data augmentation on minority class outperforms other network types. Results also indicate that Inception-v3 with data augmentation of minority class and transfer learning with weighted SVM gives the highest classification accuracies.},

abstract = {The analysis of the intern anatomy of wood samples for species identification is a complex task that only experts can perform accurately. Since there are not many experts in the world and their training can last decades, there is great interest in developing automatic processes to extract high-level information from microscopic wood images. The purpose of this work was to develop algorithms that could provide meaningful information for the classification process. The work focuses on hardwoods, which have a very diverse anatomy including many different features. The ray width is one of such features, with high diagnostic value, which is visible on the tangential section. A modified distance function for the DBSCAN algorithm was developed to identify clusters that represent rays, in order to count the number of cells in width. To test both the segmentation and the modified DBSCAN algorithms, 20 images were manually segmented, obtaining an average Jaccard index of 0.66 for the segmentation and an average index  for the clustering task. The final ray count had an accuracy of 0.91.},

abstract = {Human drivers have complex and individual behavior characteristics which describe how they act in a specific situation. Accurate behavior models are essential for many applications in the field of autonomous driving, ranging from microscopic traffic simulation, intention estimation and trajectory prediction, to interactive and cooperative motion planning. Designing such models by hand is cumbersome and inaccurate, especially in urban environments, with their high variety of situations and the corresponding diversity in human behavior. Learning how humans act from recorded scenarios is a promising way to overcome these problems. However, predicting complete trajectories at once is challenging, as one needs to account for multiple hypotheses and long-term interactions between multiple agents. In contrast, we propose to learn Markovian action models with deep neural networks that are conditioned on a driver's route intention (such as turning left or right) and the situational context. Step-wise forward simulation of these models for the different possible routes of all agents allows for multi-modal and interaction-aware scene predictions at arbitrary road layouts. Learning to predict only one time step ahead given a specific route reduces learning complexity, such that simpler and faster models are obtained. This enables the integration into particle-based algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search or particle filtering. We evaluate the learned model both on its own and integrated into our previously presented dynamic Bayesian network for intention estimation and show that it outperforms our previous hand-tuned rule-based model.},

abstract = {Personalized stent graft is designed to treat Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA). Due to the individual difference in arterial structures, stent graft has to be custom made for each AAA patient. Robotic platforms for autonomous personalized stent graft manufacturing have been proposed in recently which rely upon stereo vision systems for coordinating multiple robots for fabricating customized stent grafts. This paper proposes a novel hybrid vision system for real-time visual-sevoing for personalized stent-graft manufacturing. To coordinate the robotic arms, this system is based on projecting a dynamic stereo microscope coordinate system onto a static wide angle view stereo webcam coordinate system. The multiple stereo camera configuration enables accurate localization of the needle in 3D during the sewing process. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) method and color filtering are implemented for stereo matching and feature identifications for object localization. To maintain the clear view of the sewing process, a visual-servoing system is developed for guiding the stereo microscopes for tracking the needle movements. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm is developed for real-time intelligent robotic control. Experimental results have shown that the robotic arm can learn to reach the desired targets autonomously.},

Magnetic resonance imaging is typically used throughout the patient pathway because routine structural imaging provides detailed anatomical and pathological information and advanced techniques provide additional physiological detail.Following image feature extraction, machine learning allows accurate classification in a variety of scenarios. Machine learning also enables image feature extraction de novo although the low prevalence of brain tumours makes such approaches challenging.Much research is applied to determining molecular profiles, histological tumour grade and prognosis at the time that patients first present with a brain tumour. Following treatment, differentiating a treatment response from a post-treatment related effect is clinically important and also an area of study.

Existing methods are not precise enough to capture their tiny structures, e.g., filopodia and lamellipodia, which are critical to the understanding of cell interaction and behavior. To this end, we propose a novel deep multi-task learning model to jointly detect and segment neural cells instance-wise. Our method is built upon SSD, with ResNet101 as the backbone to achieve both high detection accuracy and fast speed. Furthermore, unlike existing works which tend to produce wavy and inaccurate boundaries, we embed a deconvolution module into SSD to better capture details. Experiments on a dataset of neural cell microscopic images show that our method is able to achieve better performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, comparing favorably with current state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Glaucoma is one of the leading cause of blindness characterized by increased intra ocular pressure (IOP), visual field defects and irreversible loss of vision. Remedial intervention of glaucoma primarily aims at the reduction of IOP and subsequent examination concerning the related anomalies in the aqueous outflow system (AOS) especially with newer angle procedures. Thus, high resolution imaging of the iridocorneal angle (ICA) region comprising trabecular meshwork (TM) is extremely valuable to clinicians and vision analysts in comprehending the disease state for the efficacious analysis and treatment of glaucoma. Imaging of the AOS inside the eye using the digitally scanned Bessel-Gauss beam light sheet microscopy has been used in this study to obtain high resolution optical sections with minimal phototoxicity and photobleaching. This paper investigates the effect of long working distance objectives in obtaining high resolution TM images while offering non-contact and non-invasive approach in imaging. A series of experiments were conducted to optimize various imaging parameters using porcine eyes as test samples. Investigations carried out by illuminating both the anterior segment region and limbal region resulted in promising results. A delineated network of collagen fibers in a meshwork fashion can be clearly seen in the obtained images of the TM. The optical sectioning capability of this technique is demonstrated and the structural features match well with previous literature reports.},

abstract = {Image de-blurring is an important research branch in computer vision. Deconvolution methods, which deconvolute the blurred images with a degradation function (or point spread function) according to estimation of the blurring cause, are commonly used in the image de-blurring on macro-scale. However, these methods are difficult to deblur an image captured by a high-magnification microscopy, where the depth-of-field of the microscopy is limit and optical diffraction is obvious, because both depth variation and optical diffraction can result in blurring imaging. Due to the complicated coupling of depth and optical diffraction in micro/nano blurring imaging, the degradation function of each point may be different, and it is not reasonable to estimate it in the geometrical optics where optical diffraction is not considered. Therefore, the accuracy of these deconvolution methods is limit because their degradation functions do not include the influence of optical diffraction. In this paper, we researched the image blurring degradation process based on the theoretical relationship between the blurring degree and the depth variation, as well as optical diffraction, and then proposed an automatic method to calculate the degradation function of every pixel with a relationship between depth information and blurring degree. Finally, a non-destructive image de-blurring method was proposed and validated with different micro/nano scale samples. The experimental result proved the effectiveness and precision of our method.},

abstract = {Dimethylamine -((CH3)2N) (DMA), is one of the genotoxic highly volatile chemical compound that has significant biochemical effect on human genetic cells. In addition to the role of bio-marker in determining the fish freshness, dimethylamine is also used as a pre-cursor in many applications such as in the field of pesticides, dyes, plastics, etc., Therefore, to detect DMA at its early stage in commercial areas is of great importance in protecting the atmosphere as well as human health due to its irritability, combustibility, and toxicity. The reports on DMA sensing is in scarce and few reports that have been reported are at high temperature operation. Semiconducting metal-oxides are prominent material in chemical sensing due to its high sensitivity, faster response, and better stability. Hence, in the present work, vanadium pentoxide ${mathrm {(V_{2}O_{5})}}$ chemi-resistive sensor was developed to detect DMA vapours at room temperature for the minimum concentration of about 5 ppm. ${mathrm {V_{2}O_{5}}}$ nanoparticles were synthesized using hydrothermal technique and its structural information has been obtained from X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles exhibited porous structure that have been observed using scanning electron microscopy. The DMA sensing studies have been carried out in a custom-made vapour sensing chamber at ambient temperature and relative humidity (25° C and 37%) for various concentrations of DMA and its sensor response (S) was calculated. Selectivity studies have been performed for various vapours and found that the synthesized nanoparticles were highly selective towards DMA vapours.},

abstract = {In solving the dynamic optimization of depth from defocus with the iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm (ISTA), the fixed iteration step decelerated the convergence efficiency of the algorithm, which led to inaccuracy of reconstructed microscopic 3D shape. Aiming at the above problems, an optimization of ISTA algorithm based on gradient estimation of acceleration operator and secant linear search (FL-ISTA) was proposed. Firstly, the acceleration operator, which consists of the linear combination of the current and previous points, was introduced to estimate the gradient and update the iteration point. Secondly, the secant linear search was used to dynamically determine the optimal iteration step, which accelerated the convergence rate of solving the dynamic optimization of depth from defocus. Experimental results of standard 500&nbsp;nm grid show that compared with ISTA, FISTA and MFISTA algorithms, the efficiency of FL-ISTA algorithm was great improved and the depth from defocus decreased by 10 percentage points, which close to the scale of 500&nbsp;nm grid. The experimental results indicate that FL-ISTA algorithm can effectively improve the convergence rate of solving dynamic optimization of depth from defocus and the accuracy of the reconstructed microscopic 3D shape.},

abstract = {Macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) has been used for aggregate modeling of urban traffic network dynamics under stationary traffic assumption for dynamic taxi dispatching, vehicle relocation and dynamic pricing schemes to tackle the dimensionality problem of microscopic approaches. A city is assumed to be partitioned into several regions with each admits a well-defined MFD. Integrating state-dependent regional travel time function as an endogenous time-varying delay, the MFD model with time delay, is adopted to describe the traffic dynamics within a region. On the other hand, it is necessary to enable simultaneous route choice and departure time choice under the MFD framework for various applications such as vehicle dispatching and relocation. This paper presents an optimal control framework to model dynamic user equilibria (DUE) with simultaneous route choice behavior and departure time choice for general urban networks. Necessary conditions for the DUE are analytically derived through the lens of Pontryagin minimum principle. In contrast to existing analytical methods, the proposed method is applicable for general MFD systems without approximation schemes of the equilibrium solution. Numerical examples by time discretization are conducted to illustrate the characteristics of DUE and corresponding dynamic external costs.},

abstract = {Sequences of microscopic images feature the dynamics of developing embryos. Automatically tracking the cells from such sequences of images allows understanding the dynamics which a living element demands to know its cells movement, which ideally should take place in real-time. The traditional tracking pipeline starts with image acquisition, data transfer, image segmentation to separate cells from the background, and then the actual tracking step. To speed up this pipeline, we hypothesize that a process capable of predicting the cell motion according to previous observations is useful. The solution must be accurate, fast and lightweight, and be able to iterate between the various components. In this work we propose CM-Predictor, which takes advantage of previous positions of cells to estimate their motion. When estimation takes place, we can omit costly acquisition, transfer and process of images, speeding up the tracking pipeline. The designed solution monitors the error of prediction, adapting the model whenever needed. For validation, we use four different datasets with sequences of images with developing embryos. Then we compare the estimated motion vectors of CM-Predictor with traditional tracking methods. Experimental results show that CM-Predictor is able to accurately estimate the motion vectors. In fact, CM-Predictor maintains the prediction quality of other algorithms and performs faster than them.},

abstract = {Existing studies have demonstrated that combining genomic data and histopathological images can better stratify cancer patients with distinct prognosis than using single biomarker, for different biomarkers may provide complementary information. However, these multi-modal data, most high-dimensional, may contain redundant features that will deteriorate the performance of the prognosis model, and therefore it has become a challenging problem to select the informative features for survival analysis from the redundant and heterogeneous feature groups. Existing feature selection methods assume that the survival information of one patient is independent to another, and thus miss the ordinal relationship among the survival time of different patients. To solve this issue, we make use of the important ordinal survival information among different patients and propose an ordinal sparse canonical correlation analysis (i.e., OSCCA) framework to simultaneously identify important image features and eigengenes for survival analysis. Specifically, we formulate our framework basing on sparse canonical correlation analysis model, which aims at finding the best linear projections so that the highest correlation between the selected image features and eigengenes can be achieved. In addition, we also add constrains to ensure that the ordinal survival information of different patients is preserved after projection. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on an early-stage renal cell carcinoma dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the selected features correlated strongly with survival, by which we can achieve better patient stratification than the comparing methods.},

abstract = {Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) is novel handheld fluorescence imaging technology that has shown promise for rapid intraoperative diagnosis of brain tumor tissue. Currently CLE is capable of image display only and lacks an automatic system to aid the surgeon in diagnostically analyzing the images. The goal of this project was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic approach for CLE imaging of human glioma with feature localization function. Despite the tremendous progress in object detection and image segmentation methods in recent years, most of such methods require large annotated datasets for training. However, manual annotation of thousands of histopathology images by physicians is costly and time consuming. To overcome this problem, we constructed a Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL)-based model for feature localization that trains on image-level annotations, and then localizes incidences of a class-of-interest in the test image. We developed a novel convolutional neural network for diagnostic features localization from CLE images by employing a novel multiscale activation map that is laterally inhibited and collaterally integrated. To validate our method, we compared the model output to the manual annotation performed by four neurosurgeons on test images. The model achieved 88% mean accuracy and 86% mean intersection over union on intermediate features and 87% mean accuracy and 88% mean intersection over union on restrictive fine features, while outperforming other state of the art methods tested. This system can improve accuracy and efficiency in characterization of CLE images of glioma tissue during surgery, and may augment intraoperative decision-making regarding the tumor margin and improve brain tumor resection.},

abstract = {Automatic detection and segmentation of cells and nuclei in microscopy images is important for many biological applications. Recent successful learning-based approaches include per-pixel cell segmentation with subsequent pixel grouping, or localization of bounding boxes with subsequent shape refinement. In situations of crowded cells, these can be prone to segmentation errors, such as falsely merging bordering cells or suppressing valid cell instances due to the poor approximation with bounding boxes. To overcome these issues, we propose to localize cell nuclei via star-convex polygons, which are a much better shape representation as compared to bounding boxes and thus do not need shape refinement. To that end, we train a convolutional neural network that predicts for every pixel a polygon for the cell instance at that position. We demonstrate the merits of our approach on two synthetic datasets and one challenging dataset of diverse fluorescence microscopy images.},

abstract = {To better understand diseases such as cancer, it is crucial for computational inference to quantify the spatial distribution of various cell types within a tumor. To this end, we used Ripley’s K-statistic, which captures the spatial distribution patterns at different scales of both individual point sets and interactions between multiple point sets. We propose to improve the expressivity of histopathology image features by incorporating this descriptor to capture potential cellular interactions, especially interactions between lymphocytes and epithelial cells. We demonstrate the utility of the Ripley’s K-statistic by analyzing digital slides from 710 TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) patients. In particular, we consider its use in the context of imaging-genetics to understand correlations between gene expression and image features using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Our analysis shows that including these spatial features leads to more significant associations between image features and gene expression.},

abstract = {We propose a novel deep learning method called Boundary-Enhanced Segmentation Network (BESNet) for the detection and semantic segmentation of cells on histopathological images. The semantic segmentation of small regions using fully convolutional networks typically suffers from inaccuracies around the boundaries of small structures, like cells, because the probabilities often become blurred. In this work, we propose a new network structure that encodes input images to feature maps similar to U-net but utilizes two decoding paths that restore the original image resolution. One decoding path enhances the boundaries of cells, which can be used to improve the quality of the entire cell segmentation achieved in the other decoding path. We explore two strategies for enhancing the boundaries of cells: (1) skip connections of feature maps, and (2) adaptive weighting of loss functions. In (1), the feature maps from the boundary decoding path are concatenated with the decoding path for entire cell segmentation. In (2), an adaptive weighting of the loss for entire cell segmentation is performed when boundaries are not enhanced strongly, because detecting such parts is difficult. The detection rate of ganglion cells was 80.0% with 1.0 false positives per histopathology slice. The mean Dice index representing segmentation accuracy was 74.0%. BESNet produced a similar detection performance and higher segmentation accuracy than comparable U-net architectures without our modifications.},

Here we propose to adopt unsupervised domain adaptation to transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained from the source domain&nbsp;to the target domain without requiring labeling of images at the target domain. The adaptation is achieved through adversarial training to find an invariant feature space along with the proposed Siamese architecture on the target domain&nbsp;to add a regularization that is appropriate for the whole-slide images. We validate the method on two prostate cancer datasets and obtain significant classification improvement of Gleason scores as compared with the baseline models.},

abstract = {Computer-Aided-Diagnosis (CAD) systems supporting the diagnostic process are widespread in radiology. Digital Pathology is still behind in the introduction of such solutions. Several studies investigated pathologists' behavior but only a few aimed to improve the diagnostic and report process with novel applications. In this work we designed and implemented a first protocol-based CAD viewer supported by visual analytics. The system targets the optimization of the diagnostic workflow in breast cancer diagnosis by means of three image analysis features that belong to the standard grading system (Nottingham Histologic Grade). A pathologist's routine was tracked during the examination of breast cancer tissue slides and diagnostic traces were analyzed from a qualitative perspective. Accordingly, a set of generic requirements was elicited to define the design and the implementation of the CAD-Viewer. A first qualitative evaluation conducted with five pathologists shows that the interface suffices the diagnostic workflow and diminishes the manual effort. We present promising evidence of the usefulness of our CAD-viewer and opportunities for its extension and integration in clinical practice. As a conclusion, the findings demonstrate that it is feasibile to optimize the Nottingham Grading workflow and, generally, the histological diagnosis by integrating computational pathology data with visual analytics techniques.},

So far, several attempts have been made using custom image features and prior knowledge in form of cytoplasm and nuclei segmentations or a restricted number of cell types in peripheral blood. Instead of hand-crafting features and classification methods for bone marrow images, we compare several well-known methods on our more challenging dataset and we show that while generic classical machine learning approaches cannot compete with specialized algorithms, even out-of-the-box deep learning methods already yield valuable results. Our findings indicate that automated analysis of bone marrow images becomes possible with the advent of convolutional neural networks.},

abstract = {Histological analyses of tissue biopsies is an essential component in the diagnosis of several diseases including cancer. In the past, evaluation of tissue samples was done manually, but to improve efficiency and ensure consistent quality, there has been a push to evaluate these algorithmically. One important task in histological analysis is the segmentation and evaluation of nuclei. Nuclear morphology is important to understand the grade and progression of disease. However, implementing automated methods at scale across histological datasets is challenging due to differences in stain, slide preparation and slide storage. This paper evaluates the impact of four stain normalization methods on the performance of nuclei segmentation algorithms. The goal is to highlight the critical role of stain normalization in improving the usability of learning-based models (such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) for this task. Using stain normalization, the baseline segmentation accuracy across distinct training and test datasets was improved by more than 50% of its base value as measured by the AUC and Recall. We believe this is the first study to perform a comparative analysis of four stain normalization approaches (histogram equalization, Reinhart, Macenko, spline mapping) on segmentation accuracy of CNNs.},

The microrobots are prepared by the phagocytosis of a mouse macrophage cell line with small size gold nanorods (sAuNRs) and anticancer drug (Doxorubicin) contained nanoliposomes (Dox-LPs). First, we synthesize sAuNRs with the average dimensions of 29 nm × 7 nm and high energy absorbance to 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) light. After that we prepare Dox-LPs having an average diameter of 145 nm and thermal sensitive property with over 65% of drug release after 60 min in a 43°C and pH 5.5 condition. After that, we fabricate the microrobots by co-incubation of sAuNRs and Dox-LPs with the macrophages. Experiments with confocal microscopy show that the nanotherapeutics can be readily engulfed by the macrophages. Finally, we evaluate the targeting characteristics of the microrobots to mouse breast cancer (4Tl) cells using a chemotactic test with a 3-D tumor spheroid resembling a solid tumor. Consequently, it is shown that the microrobots can successfully infiltrate into the tumor spheroid. Ultimately, the accompanying sAuNRs can be heated up to trigger the drug liberation from the thermal sensitive liposomes to kill microrobots and the tumor simultaneously.},

Many atomic structures have been derived from cryo-EM density maps of about 3\r{A} resolution. Side-chain conformations are well determined in density maps with super-resolutions such as 1-2\r{A}. It is desirable to have a statistical method to detect anomalous side-chains without a super-resolution density map. In this study, we analyzed structures derived from X-ray density maps with higher than 1.5\r{A} resolutions and those from cryo-EM density maps with 2-4 \r{A} and 4-6 \r{A} resolutions respectively. We introduce a histogram-based outlier score (HBOS) for anomaly detection in protein models built from cryo-EM density maps. This method uses the statistics derived from X-ray dataset (&lt;1.5\r{A}) as the reference and combines five features involving the distal block distance, side-chain length, phi, psi, and first chi angle of the residues. Higher percentages of anomalies were observed in the cryo-EM models than in the super-resolution X-ray models. Lower percentages of anomalies were observed in cryo-EM models derived after January 2017 than those before 2017.},

According to the characteristics of metal materials, we design a dedicated data structure to record the neighbor atoms for MD, which significantly reduces the memory consumption. Data compaction and double buffer are used to reduce the data transfer overhead between the main memory and the local store. We propose an on-demand communication strategy for KMC to remarkably reduce the communication overhead. We simulate 4 * 1012 atoms on 6,656,000 master+slave cores using MD with 85% parallel efficiency. Using the coupled MD-KMC approach, we simulate 3.2 * 1010 atoms in 19.2 days temporal scale on 6,240,000 master+slave cores with runtime of 8.6 hours.},

At the same time, we tested the program on GPU and KNL platform and compared the results of the Relion program on the KNL cluster platform and the GPU cluster platform. The results show that the optimization effect of Relion on the GPU platform is better than KNL.},

abstract = {The safety of building facilities is directly affected by the physical properties of cement, among which cement compressive strength plays the most important role in evaluating them. Therefore, the investigation of cement compressive strength is helpful in improving the cement properties. Traditionally, chemical composition, curing condition, and water-cement ratio are used to estimate the strength of cement paste. However, this approach is limited by the extreme complexity of physical changes and chemical reactions during cement hydration. Considering the cement microstructure contains information related to strength microscopically, microtomography, which can image three-dimensional microstructure, provides scientists with another way to study cement compressive strength nondestructively. This study estimates cement compressive strength using microstructure features extracted from microtomography images and gene expression programming. A probabilistic polarized similarity weight tournament selection operator is also proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation. Experimental results corroborate that the obtained relationship possesses higher estimation accuracy, good interpretability and the evolutionary capability performs well.},

abstract = {Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a frequent syndrome that exclusively refers to fat accumulation in liver and steatohepatitis1. It is considered as a massive disease ranging from 20% to 40% in adult populations of the Western World. Its prevalence is related to insulin resistance, which places individuals at high rates of mortality. An increased fat accumulation rate, can significantly increase the development of liver steatosis, which in later stages may progress into fibrosis and cirrhosis. In recent years, research groups focus on the automated fat detection based on histology and digital image processing. The current project, extends our previous work for the detection and quantification of fatty liver, by characterizing histological findings. It is an extensive study of supervised learning of fat droplet features, in order to exclude other findings from fat ratio computation. The method is evaluated on a set of 13 liver biopsy images, performing 92% accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper deals with an OCT (optical coherence tomography) geometric calibration method. OCT medical imaging system has received a growing interest during the last two decades. In medical purposes, OCT images are generally called optical biopsies which allows in-vivo investigation almost similar to a histopathological study. The physician can rely on the OCT images to establish a rapid and direct diagnosis. But the OCT images formation suffered numerous distortions due in particular to the optical path, from the source to the viewed sample passing through the two reflecting mirrors and a scan objective. The obtained optical biopsies include several spectral and geometric distortions. The proposed calibration model aims to compensate the geometrical ones. More precisely, two models were developed allowing the correction of both 2D images (B-Scan slices) and 3D images (volume). These models were experimentally validated (in both artificial and biological samples) using a spectral domain OCT system. It has demonstrated a significant enhancement of the OCT images accuracy.},

abstract = {Copper microwire is an essential metal widely used in micro-electron mechanical systems. Since micro/nano material usually demonstrates unique mechanical properties due to scaling effect, copper microwire mechanical properties need to be investigated for better adhibition. Herein, we propose a nanorobotics manipulation system for copper microwire insitu twisting test. Firstly, a system with six degree-of-freedoms (DOFs) nanorobotic manipulator integrated inside scanning electron microscope (SEM) is introduced. Secondly, a positioning and assembly method for copper microwire specimen are proposed to solve the mismatching problem. Finally, the copper microwire is twisted in-situ and its properties are investigated and analyzed. The copper microwire sample fracture morphology shows a severe plastic deformation and being along with the emergence of deformation twin and intertwine, which exhibit strong scaling effects. This system provides a new method for in-situ twisting test, which paves the way for mechanical characterization inside SEM and benefits the fundamental nanomaterial research immensely.},

abstract = {An enthusiastic welcome to the 2018 ACM SIGSIM Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation (PADS 2018), the 32nd for the PADS series, which this year is held in Rome.Building on its long successful history, this year the conference attracted high quality submissions on a range of topics on modelling and simulation. In total, forty six (46) submissions were submitted, thirty three (33) as regular papers and thirteen (13) as short papers. Following the rigorous double blind reviewing tradition of PADS, every paper received at least three (3) reviews. All papers and their reviews were then discussed extensively at a Programme Committee meeting that took place on the 2nd of March, 2018. Based on the deliberations of the Programme Committee, fifteen (15) papers were finally accepted as regular papers and eight (8) as short papers. Three (3) regular papers were conditionally accepted and were assigned to three shepherds respectively, who supervised their revision to a successful outcome.PADS has a long tradition of embracing the work of early career researchers as well as new ideas and cutting edge research which is in progress. A PhD Colloquium and a Poster session will showcase these exciting ideas.A significant recent development is the participation of PADS in the ACM Reproducibility Initiative. Evaluation of artifact and results replication was handled by a separate Reproducibility Committee. From the originally submitted papers, sixteen (16) regular and five (5) short papers opted for reproducibility evaluation, which is a very encouraging sign and suggests that our community is embracing this important initiative. From the finally accepted papers, five (5) regular and five (5) short have been further evaluated for reproducibility.Four (4) papers that ranked most highly by the reviewers were nominated for the Best Paper Award and were further considered by a panel to select the best paper for PADS 2018.

abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is a public health problem of first importance, being the second most common cancer worldwide. BC represents 30.4% of all new cancer cases in the European female population. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of BC is based on the clinical presentations, physical examinations combined with imaging studies, and confirmed by histopathologic findings. Pathologists’ examination is a time-consuming analysis, susceptible to an interpretation bias mainly caused by the experience of the pathologist and the decrease of attention due to fatigue. Currently, computer-aided detection and diagnosis techniques applied to digital images are assisting the specialists.In this work, the performance of a pattern recognition system based on KAZE features in combination with Bag-of-Features (BOF) to discriminate between benign and malignant tumours is evaluated on the BreakHis database (7909 images). During the training stage, KAZE keypoints are extracted for every image in the training set. Keypoints are mapped into a histogram vector using K-means clustering. This histogram represents the input to build a binary SVM classifier. In the testing stage, the KAZE keypoints are extracted for every image in the test set, and fed into the cluster model to map them into a histogram vector. This vector is finally fed into the binary SVM training classifier to classify the image.The experimental evaluation shows the feasibility and effectiveness, in terms of classification accuracy, of the proposed scheme for the binary classification of breast cancer histopathological images with a low magnification factor.},

abstract = {Various models have been developed to simulate the dynamics of building occupancy, among which the two popular types of models are agent-based models and graph-based models. Agent-based models have the advantage of handling microscopic behavior and heterogeneity while graph-based models have the advantage of computation efficiency when simulating a large number of occupants. In previous work, we developed a graph-based agent-oriented model that incorporates some agent properties into a graph-based model to simulate a large number of occupants in an efficient way. Built on previous work, this paper presents a hybrid agent-based and graph-based modeling approach that supports simulation using agent-based models in certain areas of building occupancy (e.g., intersection areas where occupants have a lot of interactions) and graph-based models in other areas. We describe the structure of the hybrid model and show experimental results that demonstrate different features of the model for building occupancy simulations.},

Especially, in biomedical imaging system which often involves incubator or heater for maintaining physiological condition, the constant focal length defined as the distance between sample and objective lens is a primary prerequisite in order to acquire clear images without blur. Among many auto-focusing methods for compensating any undesirable axial fluctuation, position feedback scheme based on capacitive sensor and piezo actuator is a simple and reliable method. Here, we devised focus stabilization system for microscopy imaging by axial position feedback using capacitive sensor and Arduino Due as a controller, which features fast response time at low-cost. The reliability of this position feedback against external fluctuations is tested, and the system worked with 4.8 nm precision. When live cell is imaged for an hour with the proposed feedback control, the image quality is noticeably enhanced compared to the case without feedback control, and it is proven by significant differences in image sharpness calculation.},

This study focused on efficacy of ionic liquid pretreatment, using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM-Ac), of rice straw for sugar production in the comparison with acid and alkaline pretreatment. The results showed that EMIM-Ac pretreatment resulted in dramatic changes in chemical structures and microscopic morphology of rice straw. These observations were associated with the high levels of sugar production. Evaluation of EMIM-Ac recyclability demonstrated that absolute methanol was an anti-solvent to yield the higher sugar levels than water and acetone. In summary, these findings show that EMIM-Ac ionic liquid is the efficient method for rice straw pretreatment due to high sugar yields and recyclability.},

Analysis of traffic systems through modeling and simulation is an essential tool for city planners to optimize traffic flow. Microscopic discrete-event simulation is a natural and powerful method for such analysis. Characteristics of traffic systems that need to be modeled include inter-arrival times, car-following behavior, lane-changing, turning, road structure, intersection structure, and traffic light timing. There are many challenges that must be confronted as well, including the calibration and validation of traffic models, scaling models to larger traffic systems, modeling the continuous nature of traffic in a discrete-event environment, and optimization of traffic system characteristics. An emerging challenge for traffic simulation is the incorporation of autonomous vehicles into traffic systems as not only traditional vehicles, but also as cooperative agents as well.},

Each case takes a large number of images, which usually have a lot of cell regions. Thus, analyzing the images is hard work for pathologists, and misdiagnosis may happen. In this paper, we develop an automatic CTCs identification method for fluorescence microscopy images. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we extract cell regions in images using filtering methods. Second, we compute features of each CTC candidate regions. Finally, we identify the CTCs using AdaBoost algorithm. And we analyze the features to know which ones are effective for characterizing CTCs and normal cells. We apply the proposed method to 5040 microscopy images, and evaluate the effectiveness of our method by using leave-one-out cross validation. We achieve a true positive rate of 97.30 [%] and a false positive rate of 12.82 [%].},

abstract = {Lane changes can induce natural large perturbations in traffic flow and are known to impact traffic throughput and energy consumption. Their precise effects are understudied. The primary aim of this article is to present a model for lane changing that is tractable for system-level analysis and yet captures qualities of microscopic vehicle dynamics. We present a stochastic lane changing model, which permits a two-stage reduction: 1) of the (microscopic) multi-lane problem into a stochastic single-lane problem, and 2) of the stochastic single-lane model into a Markov chain macroscopic model which captures system-level lane-changing characteristics. The first reduction contributes the first model of lane changing as a single-lane process, which permits the simplification of theoretical analysis. The Markov chain macroscopic model permits the computation of statistics on the traffic parameters, such as expected velocity and headway, thus permitting the quantification of the effect of lane changes on traffic flow. We validate the proposed model on NGSIM and confirm the accuracy of the Markov chain for computing headway statistics. Finally, counter to a common view of lane changes as perturbations which contribute to shockwave formation, we observe that lane changes reduce the variance of the velocity by 10% on a 230-meter ring road benchmark, which suggests that discretionary lane changes may serve to reduce stop and go waves rather than increase them.},

abstract = {Industrial robotic manipulators can be augmented by a micro-positioning unit in order to increase their precision resulting in a so called macro-micro-manipulator. The micro-positioning unit is typically driven by piezoelectric actuators due to their beneficial properties. However, contact forces during interaction tasks induce deviations from the nominal path that can not be observed due to compliance, lack of sensors in the micro-positioning unit, or unknown interaction dynamics in constrained environments. In this paper, a model-free and decoupled disturbance rejection controller via visual feedback for macro-micro-manipulators is presented. An external stereoscopic vision system is employed to detect deviations from the nominal trajectory. We outline an image segmentation algorithm and the utilized camera calibration technique is based on two-view geometry. Afterwards, the disturbance rejection controller including visual feedback for the macro-micro-manipulator is described. In order to demonstrate the 3D capability of the proposed approach, a microscopic staircase is milled. For comparison, the milling experiment is executed without and with active disturbance rejection by the micro-positioning unit in order to show the increase in precision during the milling task. Results show that the arithmetic mean roughness falls below 2 μm for the step profiles and the maximum surface height deviation is less than ±10 μm for each steps.},

The TSM images contain a large number of mineral grains and the differences among adjacent grains are usually ambiguous, which makes current segmentation technologies inefficient. In this paper, we take advantage of multi-angle TSM images and propose a method for grain segmentation. Accordingly, the method consists of two steps, in the first step, we enhance the SLIC algorithm to handle multi-angle images and produce the initial superpixels. In the second step, multiple features are extracted for comprehensive description of the superpixels, and dissimilarities between superpixels are measured according to the extracted features. Then the multi-angle region merging algorithm is employed to merge similar adjacent superpixels and get the final segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method for grain segmentation of TSM images.},

abstract = {Accurate cell segmentation is one of the critical, yet challenging problems in microscopy images due to ambiguous boundaries as well as a wide variation of shapes and sizes of cells. Even though a number of existing methods have achieved decent results for cell segmentation, boundary vagueness between adjoining cells tended to cause generation of perceptually inaccurate segmentation of stained nuclei. We propose a segmentation method of cells based on structural dissimilarity between embodied and imaged cells. From assumption that the shape of the region of adjoining cells follows a 2D Gaussian mixture model, the cell region is divided by an expectation-maximization method. The lowest structural dissimilarity using embodied cells decides on the number of components of the 2D Gaussian mixture model. The region of interest is extracted by implementation of both global and local thresholdings, which performs binarization of the local image with a seed at the center, where the seed is obtained by the maximally stable extremal regions. Our approach presented considerably higher evaluation scores compared with other five existing methods in terms of both accuracies of region of interest (ROI) detection and boundary discrimination.},

In this paper, we propose Unsupervised Multimodal Graph Mining (UMGM) to learn the discriminative features for probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) mosaics of breast tissue. We build a multiscale multimodal graph based on both pCLE mosaics and histology images. The positive pairs are mined via cycle consistency and the negative pairs are extracted based on geodetic distance. Given the positive and negative pairs, the latent feature space is discovered by reconstructing the similarity between pCLE and histology images. Experiments on a database with 700 pCLE mosaics demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous works on pCLE feature learning. Specially, the top-1 accuracy in an eight-class retrieval task is 0.659 which leads to 10% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art method.},

Recently in general computer vision, Fisher encoding combined with convolutional neural network (ConvNet) has become popular as a highly discriminative feature descriptor. However, Fisher vectors have two intrinsic problems that could limit their performance: high dimensionality and bursty visual elements. To address these problems, we design a novel supervised intra-embedding algorithm with a multilayer neural network model to transform the ConvNet-based Fisher vectors into a more discriminative feature representation. We apply this feature encoding method on two public datasets, including the BreaKHis image dataset of benign and malignant breast tumors, and IICBU 2008 lymphoma dataset of three malignant lymphoma subtypes. The results demonstrate that our supervised intra-embedding method helps to enhance the ConvNet-based Fisher vectors effectively, and our classification results largely outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.},

abstract = {Despite the plethora of gene expression based cancer biomarkers in the scientific literature, a few make their way to the clinic. In the past, several efforts have been made to predict cancer biomarkers with very limited success so far. One of the challenges in the field of cancer biology is to predict cancer at an early stage. The success of various therapies to treat cancer patients depends on correct identification of stage or progression of cancer. Despite the tremendous progress in the field of genomics and proteomics, the performance of stage classification has not improved substantially. Recently our group also developed CancerCSP, a server with prediction models for discriminating early and late stage of clear cell renal cancer (ccRCC) samples based on the gene expression profile. We achieved maximum accuracy of 72.64% with ROC value 0.81, despite the fact that we tried state of- the-art techniques to improve the performance of our models. This raises the question, why the models fail to discriminate ccRCC patients in the early and late stage with high accuracy. In this poster, the analysis is carried out on ccRCC samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal to understand the reasons for the failure of the stage classification models. Firstly, we performed bin-wise analysis of top 20 genes that can discriminate (single gene-based models using threshold) early and late stage samples with highest ROC. A significant overlap was observed in the expression of each gene in early and late stage samples. Though the number of early and late stage samples varied in different gene expression bins, this was not sufficient to classify both types of samples with high accuracy. As an example, the gene NR3C2 had maximum ROC of 0.67 at expression (log RSEM) of 7.61. There were nearly 70% early stage patients above this threshold that made it an average expression marker but the presence of nearly 55% of late stage patients above this threshold increased the false positives. Secondly, we performed hierarchical clustering of ccRCC samples using 64- gene expression features selected using Weka showed weak concordance with pathological stage. The k-means clustering of patients into four groups showed four separable clusters, but these clusters were not associated with the pathological stage. These observations led to the conclusion that the molecular parameters do not always comply with histopathological features. The third analysis was done to identify patients, which were not predicted correctly by any of the four machine-learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, SMO and Na\"{\i}ve Bayes). Many samples were not predicted correctly by any of the four machine-learning methods. The false positives and false negatives belonged to explicit clusters obtained through clustering. This further points out to the interspersed nature of the data to differentiate between histopathological stages of cancer. We reach the conclusion that expression profile of genes is not adequate to classify different stages of cancer samples.},

Not all data produced is within a resolution that enables us to visualize the atomic-structure of the molecule. However, information like secondary structure locations is detectable. At an intermediate step in de novo modeling, the matching between these locations and the amino acid sequence segments that underlie these secondary structure elements needs to be addressed. Many tools have been developed to address this matching problem including DP-TOSS. In this paper, we propose a recast of DP-TOSS that incorporates a geometry-based analytical function to improve accuracy. A test of 15 proteins shows that our analytical function has a positive impact on the accuracy of DP-TOSS.},

However, it is challenging to extract the backbone structure information automatically and efficiently. This paper presents a novel method for creating a backbone trace and predicting locations of Cα atoms for high resolution density maps. It is a graph based method utilizing density along a backbone trace and features of secondary structure elements to find the optimal backbone trace and Cα atom locations. The method is mostly automatic requiring an initial user determined threshold value and primary secondary structure type. We tested our method on fifteen simulated maps at 3A resolution and four experimental cryo-EM density maps between 2.6-3.1A resolution. The result shows that our method is able to generate a complete Cα backbone trace when the density map is not missing data at near atomic resolution.},

abstract = {Counterfeiting of physical goods is a global problem amounting to nearly 7% of world trade. While there have been a variety of overt technologies like holograms and specialized barcodes and covert technologies like taggants and PUFs, these solutions have had a limited impact on the counterfeit market due to a variety of factors - clonability, cost or adoption barriers. In this paper, we introduce a new mechanism that uses machine learning algorithms on microscopic images of physical objects to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit versions of the same product. The underlying principle of our system stems from the idea that microscopic characteristics in a genuine product or a class of products (corresponding to the same larger product line), exhibit inherent similarities that can be used to distinguish these products from their corresponding counterfeit versions. A key building block for our system is a wide-angle microscopy device compatible with a mobile device that enables a user to easily capture the microscopic image of a large area of a physical object. Based on the captured microscopic images, we show that using machine learning algorithms (ConvNets and bag of words), one can generate a highly accurate classification engine for separating the genuine versions of a product from the counterfeit ones; this property also holds for "super-fake" counterfeits observed in the marketplace that are not easily discernible from the human eye. We describe the design of an end-to-end physical authentication system leveraging mobile devices, portable hardware and a cloud-based object verification ecosystem. We evaluate our system using a large dataset of 3 million images across various objects and materials such as fabrics, leather, pills, electronics, toys and shoes. The classification accuracy is more than 98% and we show how our system works with a cellphone to verify the authenticity of everyday objects.},

The automated system for gripping wires was designed and implemented to work with a stereo light microscope (SLM). The relative position of the micro-gripper and the wire is calculated by the vision system. The position data provides feedback to a mobile platform with three degrees of freedom, so positioning of the micro-gripper can be controlled. The performance of the micro-gripper system has been evaluated as follows. The positioning accuracy of feature points was determined experimentally by calculating the feature point coordinates in the world coordinate frame (WCF) as the micro-gripper moved along the X axis, Y axis and Z axis. The results were compared with the actual motion of the micro-gripper and the gripping performance was verified.},

abstract = {High resolution and high throughput imaging are typically mutually exclusive. While there is a wide range of techniques to image features beyond the diffraction limit of light, they all have their own benefits and drawbacks, but they are often very slow compared to optical systems. As such, extending the performance of optical microscopes remains. Examples of high resolution optical concepts are metamaterials nano-antennas, superoscillatory lenses and hyperlenses. These concepts require precise and high speed positioning of the optical element at lens-to-sample separations measured in tens of nanometers. We present a design and process for a MEMS nanopositioning stage capable of sub-nm positioning of a metamaterials optical lens with very high bandwidth. Laser vibrometer measurements on the first batch of fully fabricated devices showed that the first eigenfrequency is at 500±25 kHz, somewhat below the 660 kHz obtained by FEM simulations. Due to squeeze film damping, the quality factor is relatively low (approximately 2–2.5), which is advantageous for reaching high positioning bandwidth when the device is used in a near-field optical imaging microscope.},

abstract = {From microbial communities, human physiology to social and biological/neural networks, complex interdependent systems display multi-scale spatio-temporal patterns that are frequently classified as non-linear, non-Gaussian, non-ergodic, and/or fractal. Distinguishing between the sources of nonlinearity, identifying the nature of fractality (space versus time) and encapsulating the non-Gaussian characteristics into dynamic causal models remains a major challenge for studying complex systems. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical strategy for constructing compact yet accurate models of complex systems dynamics that aim to scrutinize the causal effects and influences by analyzing the statistics of the magnitude increments and the inter-event times of stochastic processes. We derive a framework that enables to incorporate knowledge about the causal dynamics of the magnitude increments and the inter-event times of stochastic processes into a multi-fractional order nonlinear partial differential equation for the probability to find the system in a specific state at one time. Rather than following the current trends in nonlinear system modeling which postulate specific mathematical expressions, this mathematical frame-work enables us to connect the microscopic dependencies between the magnitude increments and the inter-event times of one stochastic process to other processes and justify the degree of nonlinearity. In addition, the newly presented formalism allows to investigate appropriateness of using multi-fractional order dynamical models for various complex system which was overlooked in the literature. We run extensive experiments on several sets of physiological processes and demonstrate that the derived mathematical models offer superior accuracy over state of the art techniques.},

abstract = {In this paper we report about the scaling perspective of ultra-scaled HfO&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; Resistive Random Access Memory devices. Due to filamentary conduction, the scalability of these devices is considered to be ultimately limited by the size of the conductive filament. However, even though the precise size and shape of the filament is not fully elucidated, it is widely accepted that its size is mainly controlled by the current compliance. In turn, the latter sets the operating current level of the cell. The reduction of the current level is nevertheless accompanied by performance instabilities, which are the main reliability threat for low-current operations. The resulting tradeoff raises concerns about the scalability potential of RRAM devices. In this work, we combine device-level measurements, Conductive Atomic-Force Microscopy (C-AFM), and physics-based simulations of HfO&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; RRAM devices to elucidate the reason for these instabilities. Results clarify the scaling perspectives of ultra-low cell size (&lt; 10×10 nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) RRAMs and their reliability.},

However, occasional reports on irregularities during recovery have been published. We will show here that — consistent with a gate-sided hydrogen release mechanism — additional degradation can apparently build-up during recovery also after BTI stress, which can under certain circumstances even exceed the post-stress degradation levels. This additional degradation may invalidate existing lifetime extrapolation methods and must therefore be carefully understood. Our results demonstrate that although post-stress degradation build-up is only visible under certain conditions, it is an essential feature of BTI and thus provides important clues on its microscopic origin.},

abstract = {Two different sizes of Pd@ZnO core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) have been prepared by using two differentsizes of Pd NPs (15 and 50 nm) as metal cores and applied for acetaldehyde gas sensing. Transmissionelectron microscopy images revealed that the overall size of two sensing materials such as Pd15@ZnO andPd50@ZnO core-shell NPs are 80-100 nm and 100-120 nm, respectively. Xray-diffraction pattern revealedthat the oxidation of Pd metal core was started from 300°C. The spherical shape and size are maintainedafter the Pd@ZnO core-shell NPs was calcined at 500°C for 2 h. PdO15@ZnO core-shell NPs showedhigher response to acetaldehyde. The maximum response of PdO15@ZnO core-shell NPs to 100 ppm ofacetaldehyde at 350 °C was 75, whereas the maximum response of PdO50@ZnO core-shell NPs to 100 ppmof acetaldehyde was 28 as compared to the pure ZnO NPs (Rs=18). The high response of PdO15@ZnO coreshellNPs than PdO50@ZnO core-shell NPs is due to the smaller size of PdO core, which has more catalyticactivity than 50 nm sized PdO core.},

abstract = {Brain mapping research is facilitated by first aligning digital images of mouse brain slices to standardized atlas framework such as the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA). However, conventional processing of these brain slices introduces many histological artifacts such as tears and missing regions in the tissue, which make the automatic alignment process extremely challenging. We present an end-to-end fully automatic registration pipeline for alignment of digital images of mouse brain slices that may have histological artifacts, to a standardized atlas space. We use a geometric approach where we first align the bounding box of convex hulls of brain slice contours and atlas template contours, which are extracted using a variant of Canny edge detector. We then detect the artifacts using Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) and remove them from the contours before performing global alignment of points using iterative closest point (ICP). This is followed by a final non-linear registration by solving the Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We tested our algorithm on 200 mouse brain slice images including slices acquired from conventional processing techniques having major histological artifacts, and from serial two-photon tomography (STPT) with no major artifacts. We show significant improvement over other registration techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in all slices especially on slices with significant histological artifacts.},

abstract = {Malaria is a deadly infectious disease affecting red blood cells in humans due to the protozoan of type Plasmodium. In 2015, there is an estimated death toll of 438, 000 patients out of the total 214 million malaria cases reported world-wide. Thus, building an accurate automatic system for detecting the malarial cases is beneficial and has huge medical value. This paper addresses the detection of Plasmodium Falciparum infected RBCs from Leishman's stained microscope slide images. Unlike the traditional way of examining a single focused image to detect the parasite, we make use of a focus stack of images collected using a bright field microscope. Rather than the conventional way of extracting the specific features we opt for using Convolutional Neural Network that can directly operate on images bypassing the need for hand-engineered features. We work with image patches at the suspected parasite location there by avoiding the need for cell segmentation. We experiment, report and compare the detection rate received when only a single focused image is used and when operated on the focus stack of images. Altogether the proposed novel approach results in highly accurate malaria detection.},

By contrast, time courses of diameter and aspect ratio for ELCTs during the culture period were not dependent on the macroscopic structure of collagen hydrogels.},

abstract = {With the increasingly widespread use of traffic flow simulation models, several questions concerning the reliability, efficiency and accuracy of such models need to be addressed convincingly. In general, the most time-efficient traffic flow models are based on the macroscopic approach to describe traffic dynamics. Macroscopic models reproduce the evolution of aggregated traffic characteristics over time and space with respect to observable variables, such as flow and speed, requiring much less computational time, compared to microscopic ones. This work assesses a second-order macroscopic gas-kinetic traffic flow (GKT) model and its numerical implementation using real traffic data from a motorway network in the U.K., where recurrent congestion originated from high on-ramp flows during the morning peak hours is observed. A parallel, metamodel-assisted Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed for the calibration of the model parameters, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the DE algorithm can be a very promising method for the calibration of such traffic flow models.},

This paper presents the development of a computational approach in H&amp;E stained pathological images to quantitatively describe cellular heterogeneity from different types of cells. In our work, a deep learning approach was first used for cell subtype classification. Then we introduced a set of quantitative features to describe cellular information. Several feature selection methods were used to discover significant imaging biomarkers for survival prediction. These discovered imaging biomarkers are consistent with pathological and biological evidence. Experimental results on two lung cancer data sets demonstrated that survival models bsuilt from the clinical imaging biomarkers have better prediction power than state-of-the-art methods using molecular profiling data and traditional imaging biomarkers.},

abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) has become central to the study of large-scale molecular interactions and has produced three-dimensional (3D) density maps at various resolutions. Secondary structure element (SSE) identification from volumetric protein density maps is critical for de novo backbone structure derivation in cryo-EM. Multiple methods have been developed to detect helix and β-sheet from density maps at medium resolutions (~5-10\r{A}). β-barrel as a special β-sheet structure has been found in many proteins. However, currently there are no methods aimed to automatically and accurately extract the β-barrel as a complete chunk of density from cryo-EM map of β-barrel protein. We present an effective approach, BarrelMiner, to automatically extract the β-barrel region from cryo-EM density maps based on the conspicuous cylindrical shape of β-barrel. BarrelMiner has been tested using ten simulated density maps at 10\r{A} resolution and seven experimental cryo-EM maps between 5.5\r{A} and 8.25\r{A} resolution. The result suggests that BarrelMiner can be used for the detection of β-barrel from medium resolution cryo-EM density maps of β-barrel proteins.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is considered primarily as a very precise tool for surface metrology. Surface features are reconstructed through scanning the surface by a silicon cantilever. The recent use of self-sensing piezo-resistive cantilevers has led to the development of self-sensing and self-actuating cantilevers and eliminates the need for the bulky conventional optical deflection measurement systems. A developed AFM system using such self-sensing self-actuating (PRSA) cantilevers has been integrated into a Nano Positioning and Nano Measuring Machine (NMM-1). The developed (PRSA_AFM) system has a measuring range of 25 mm × 25 mm × 5 mm which overcomes the limitation in the measurement range of conventional AFM systems. This large range self-sensing Atomic force microscope (LR-SAFM) has been successfully used for surface roughness measurement. A roughness standard of 0.261 µm R&lt;inf&gt;a&lt;/inf&gt; was measured with a resolution of 0.1 nm. The roughness parameters are determined. The dynamic behaviour and accuracy of the developed system have been investigated.},

It is shown that the resulting colors in two images of the same fragments are more similar to each other. The prepared microscope color calibration slide is adjusted to the standardization of immunohistochemically stained tissue samples but it can be easily adjusted to other types of staining.

abstract = {Micro-sized agents can benefit robotic minimally invasive surgery since they can be inserted into the human body and use natural pathways such as arteries and veins or the gastrointestinal tract, to reach their target for drug delivery or diagnosis. Recently, miniaturized agents with shape-changing and gripping capabilities have provided significant advantages in performing grasping, transportation, and manipulation tasks. In order to robustly perform such tasks, it is of utmost importance to properly estimate their overall configuration. This paper presents a novel solution to the problem of estimating and tracking the 3D position, orientation and configuration of the tips of miniaturized grippers from RGB marker-less visual observations obtained by a microscope. We consider this as an optimization problem, seeking for the gripper model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between hypothesized instances of the gripper model and actual observations of the miniaturized gripper. This optimization problem is solved using a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed approach has been evaluated on several image sequences showing the grippers moving, rotating, opening/closing and grasping biological material.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an automated algorithm for plant identification using microscopic images of powder of herbal plants. In current scenario, the task of identifying plant from its powder form is done by pharmaceutical companies, which perform this task manually. This process takes lots of effort and time. Microscopic image of powder contains varieties of information, which are important evidence for identification of the plant. With every image, different type of noise are present, which makes the segmentation as a critical job. In this paper, we are proposing an algorithm which performs this task automatically by a computer. Our method consists two steps: "Pre-Processing" and "Image Segmentation". Firstly, microscopic images of "Liquorice" and "Rhubarb" plants were taken. On those images Top-hat and Bot-hat transformation are performed. Wiener Filter is used for image smoothing. An image segmentation is performed using Otsu's thresholding algorithm and find region of interest. The extra blobs were removed using morphological operations. Our proposed algorithm shows the efficiency for successfully detection of Liquorice and Rhubarb plants are 91.37% and 92.94% respectively.},

To this aim, one important step is the validation of such image processing methods. Ideally, the \^{a} ground truth\^{a} should be known, which is possible only by manually labelling images or in artificially produced images. To simulate artificial images, we have developed a platform for simulating biologically inspired objects, which generates bodies with various morphologies and kinetics and, that can aggregate to form clusters. Using this platform, we tested and compared four tracking algorithms: Simple Nearest-Neighbour (NN), NN with Morphology and two DBSCAN-based methods. We show that Simple NN works well for small object velocities, while the others perform better on higher velocities and when clustering occurs. Our new platform for generating new benchmark images to test image analysis algorithms is openly available at (http://griduni.uninova.pt/Clustergen/ClusterGen_v1.0.zip).},

abstract = {Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are important in obtaining precision medicine and patient driven solutions for various diseases. One of the main brain tumor is the Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and histopathological tissue images can provide unique insights into identifying and grading disease stages. In this work, we consider feature extraction and disease stage classification for brain tumor histopathological images using automatic image analysis methods. In particular we utilized automatic nuclei segmentation and labeling for histopathology image data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and check for classification accuracy using support vector machine (SVM), Random Forests (RF). Our results indicate that we obtain classification accuracy 98.9% and 99.6% respectively.},

abstract = {Automatic registration is an important task to prepare aligned 2D images for 3D structure visualization, and it is a challenging problem especially for the microscope images. This paper proposes a novel coevolution-based coarse-to-fine registration method, aiming to align the regions of interest (ROIs) in the image sequence. Firstly, a coarse registration for whole images is executed by a scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) based method, which can facilitate the segmentation of ROIs. Secondly, a fine registration for the segmented ROIs is done by a genetic algorithm (GA) with a novel coevolutionary strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method and it is also successfully applied to the renal biopsy image sequence.},

abstract = {This article describes the design, fabrication and testing of a new XY nanopositioning stage constructed from a single sheet of piezoelectric material. The approach involves direct ultrasonic machining of a piezoelectric sheet to create flexural and actuator features. An industrial inkjet printer is then used to create electrode features by printing Nitric Acid directly onto the evaporated metal surface of the piezo sheet. The result is a monolithic piezoelectric structure with individual electrical control over each actuator feature. Experimental results demonstrate a full-scale range of 9 μm in the X and Y axes, and a first resonance frequency of 230 Hz in the Z axes. The completed nanopositioner is the thinnest yet reported with a thickness of only 500 μm. The new design method will enable a new range of ultra-compact applications in scanning probe microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and active optics.},

abstract = {While the feature size of micro-fabricated structures is continuously diminishing, the issue of high accuracy measurement becomes increasingly significant. In recent years, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has become a powerful measurement tool which has been widely used in micro- and nano-fabricated structure inspection. However, owing to the fixed tilting angle of the scanning probe in traditional AFM, there generally exists a distorted scanning result at the corner and sidewall of the scanned sample. To mitigate the mentioned problem, this paper presents a self-designed dual-probe AFM system with an on-line adaptive tilting angle algorithm which can estimate the most effective tilting angle for each scanning probe. Above all, a novel probe-tilting mechanism is designed to change the tilting angle after one-line scanning process is accomplished. As a result, a complete and high-precision scanning image can be obtained in a single scan through such dual-probe structure.},

abstract = {We achieve selective penetration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells using iron-oxide nanoparticles without causing a permanent damage to the membrane and without any effect on the cell morphology. The nanoparticles are controllably pulled towards the cells under the influence of the magnetic field gradients. First, the nanoparticles are fabricated and their magnetic dipole moment is characterized to be 7.8\texttimes{}10−8 A.m2, at magnetic field of 60 mT and mass of 1.80\texttimes{}10−9 kg. This characterization is done by measuring the magnetic force exerted on their dipole moment under the influence of controlled magnetic field gradient. Second, a magnetic-based control system is designed and used to achieve selective targeting of the cells under microscopic guidance. We find that the magnetic control achieves immediate uptake of nanoparticles in the MCF-7 cells without incubation for relatively long time, using magnetic force less than 51 nN. In addition, a microforce sensing probe is used to characterize the impendence of the cells to limit the exerted magnetic force during penetration and to avoid causing damage to the membrane. We find that a single cell can overcome penetration force in excess of 13.3 µN.},

A third rare subset was described, atypical spitz tumors (AST), that share overlapping histologic features of SN and SM. Being difficult to diagnose lesions, both with dermoscopy and histology, there is considerable uncertainty regarding their biological potential. We aimed to investigate if digital dermoscopy analysis (DDA) could select some significantly different features in 41 dermoscopic images including 19 SN and 21 AST. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed in order to verify if there were dermoscopic features able to discriminate between SN and AST. No significant dermoscopic criteria were found to distinguish AST from SN. This support the hypothesis that AST was should be considered not as a different entity but within the spectrum of AN lesions.},

In particular, the evidence gathered from experiments designed to investigate the dependence of charge detrapping on cell threshold-voltage reveals that the simple and widely used model based only on carrier exchange between oxide defects and substrate is not enough to explain the main features of the phenomenon. We then propose a new microscopic description of the detrapping phenomenology, including structural relaxation of oxide defects as a limiting step enabling carrier exchange. This new microscopic picture for the oxide defects is, finally, implemented in a statistical model able to reproduce the charge trapping/detrapping dynamics and the consequent threshold-voltage instabilities along the memory array lifetime.},

abstract = {Subtle emotions are expressed through tiny and brief movements of facial muscles, called micro-expressions; thus, recognition of these hidden expressions is as challenging as inspection of microscopic worlds without microscopes. In this paper, we show that through motion magnification, subtle expressions can be realistically exaggerated and become more easily recognisable. We magnify motions of facial expressions in the Eulerian perspective by manipulating their amplitudes or phases. To evaluate effects of exaggerating facial expressions, we use a common framework (LBP-TOP features and SVM classifiers) to perform 5-class subtle emotion recognition on the CASME II corpus, a spontaneous subtle emotion database. According to experimental results, significant improvements in recognition rates of magnified micro-expressions over normal ones are confirmed and measured. Furthermore, we estimate upper bounds of effective magnification factors and empirically corroborate these theoretical calculations with experimental data.},

This simultaneous sectioning and imagingapproach has following benefits: (1) No image registration is required. (2) No manual job is required fortissue sectioning, placement or microscope imaging. However spurious pixels are present at the left and rightside of the image, since the field of view of the objective is larger than the tissue width. The tissue regionneeds to be extracted from these images. Moreover, unwanted artifacts are introduced by KESM\^{a} s imagingmechanism, namely: (1) Vertical stripes caused by unevenly worn knife edge. (2) Horizontal artifacts dueto vibration of the knife while cutting plastic embedded tissue. (3) Uneven intensity within an image due toknife misalignment. (4) Uneven intensity levels across images due to the variation of cutting speed.

Automated image analysis algorithms help in extracting information from these images. Validation of the automated algorithms can be done with ground truth data based on manual annotations, or using synthetic data with known ground truth. Synthetic data avoids the need to annotate manually large datasets but may lack important characteristics of the real data. In this paper, we present a framework for the generation of realistic synthetic fluorescence microscopy image sequences of cells, based on the simulation of spots with realistic motion models, noise models, and with the use of real background from microscopy images. Our framework aims to close the gap between real and synthetic image sequences. To study the effect of real backgrounds, we compared three spot detection methods using our synthetic image sequences. The results show that the real background influences spot detection, reducing the effectiveness of the spot detection algorithms, indicating the value of synthetic images with a realistic background in system validation.},

By using above mentioned two liquids, transparent liquids were colored in red when they were mixed. For this season, the mixing was clearly visualized. Because Reynolds number of the flow was so small as 0.27-17.7, the flow became the laminar one. Accordingly, two liquids were not mixed near the junction where they were joined together. However, they were gradually mixed by diffusion during they flowed in the mixer paths. It was clarified that the mixing ratio varied depending on the flow-path shape, flow rate, and flow-path width.},

abstract = {Laser fluorescence spectroscopy (LFS) is widely used in medicine. Today, oncology and oncosurgery are considered as the most promising fields of its application. It is known that cancerous tissues are able to accumulate different porphyrins, both endogenous and exogenous, in enhanced amount due to increased metabolism in cancerous cells. So, LFS can be used in vivo for detection of malignant tumours as well as for real-time intraoperative imaging or diagnostics at a photodynamic therapy. One of the reason of the enhanced accumulation of porphyrins in tissues is a chronic hypoxia. Therefore, it was hypothesized, that LFS could also be used for diagnosis of local inflammation in tissues. Recently, some indirect data confirming the hypothesis was obtained when observed inflammation due to invasion of external substances into tissues. This study proves the hypothesis in a direct experiment with animals and laboratory tests. Enhanced fluorescence intensity of the exogenous photosensitizer was found in inflamed tissues. The direct association between intensity of the fluorescence, histological characteristics and blood test results was shown. It was found that the registered fluorescence signal correlates with neutrophil counts in blood of tested animals. It proves that LFS could be an effective tool for registration of local inflammation.},

The surface morphology and optical properties of Au NPs decorated over 2D PS colloidal crystals (CC) on flexible substrate is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-visible spectroscopy. The sensitivity of the Au NPs/ 2D CC/PDMS system for NH3 detection is investigated by the SERS techniques. A significant increase in the SERS intensity is observed as a function of NH3 concentration from 100 to 1000 ppm for the synthesized sensors system. The noticeable change in the SERS intensity with the exposure of the NH3 gas is attributed to the change in the electric near-field due to the Au NPs aggregation or distance as well as change in the dielectric of the surrounding medium. The SERS intensity exhibit a dependence on the change in refractive index/dielectric constant by NH3 gas molecules, and are linked to coupling effects between surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on the corrugated Au NPs islands and the hot spot formed by 2D PS CC assembly. The proposed Au NPs/ 2D CC/PDMS sensor system is capable for single molecule detection of gaseous precursors.},

During specimen sectioning and collecting, it is very hard to prevent wrinkle from these sections, which introduce distortion when imaging in electron microscopy and cause failure of structure reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for registration of serial sections with wrinkle. First, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is used to detect corresponding landmarks across adjacent sections. Second, wrinkle areas are labeled manually in microscopy images, which is easy to distinguish by eye. Finally, a modified Moving-Least-Square deformation algorithm is applied to register adjacent sections with wrinkle. The algorithm reflects the discontinuity around wrinkle areas while keeps the smoothness in other regions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {Motivation: Automated microscopy enables scientists to image an area of an experimental sample that is much larger than the microscope's Field of View (FOV) and to carry out time-lapse studies of cell cultures. An automated microscope acquires these images by generating a grid of partially overlapping images. This process generates hundreds to hundreds of thousands of image tiles that need to be stitched into a wide image. We address the problem of creating image mosaics from a grid of overlapping tiles constrained to only translational offsets. The challenges of creating a large mosaic image are: (1) sensitivity to image features in the overlapping regions of adjacent tiles (e.g., during the early period of cell colony growth), (2) computational requirements needed to assemble the resulting mosaic image, and (3) absence of ground truth needed for evaluating the accuracy of a stitching method.},

abstract = {Self-organization is an important topic of material physics. It is caused by a property (amphipathicity) to have both liking water part (hydrophilic) and part liking oil (hydrophobic) in surfactant molecules. On the other hand, “Salts” that is sodium chloride ionizes to cation and anion but they attract water molecule selective. Therefore, we think that a Mixture of Water/Organic Solvent/salt don't form ordered structure like the microphase separated structure. However, we discovered that antagonistic salts, which are composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions, induce multi-lamellar vesicles in a mixture of water/organic solvent although no surfactants are contained. In this case, hydrophobic ions preferentially attract organic solvents around themselves. In the present study, we investigated the structural properties of the mixture of water / 2,6-dimethylpyridine / NaBPh4 by polarization microscope at room temperature. Then, crystal structures with a scale of 1 µm to 100µm are observed. The number of the crystals increases with increasing the concentration of NaBPh4. On the other hand, the overall shape of the crystal does not change with the salt concentration. We assumed that the crystal structure is composed of water, 2,6-dimethylpyridine, and NaBPh4.},

The framework uses Random Forest feature selection, class-balanced training example subsampling and support vector machine (SVM) classification to predict the presence of high- and low-grade prostate cancer (HG-PCa and LG-PCa) on image tiles. Using annotated whole-slide prostate digital pathology images to train and test on two separate patient cohorts, classification performance, as measured with area under the ROC curve (AUC), was 0.703 for HG-PCa and 0.705 for LG-PCa. These results improve upon previous work and demonstrate the effectiveness of cell-density and stain normalization on classification of prostate digital slides across cohorts.},

abstract = {Accurate localization, identification and segmentation of vertebrae is an important task in medical and biological image analysis. The prevailing approach to solve such a task is to first generate pixelindependent features for each vertebra, e.g. via a random forest predictor, which are then fed into an MRF-based objective to infer the optimal MAP solution of a constellation model. We abandon this static, twostage approach and mix feature generation with model-based inference in a new, more flexible, way. We evaluate our method on two data sets with different objectives. The first is semantic segmentation of a 21-part body plan of zebrafish embryos in microscopy images, and the second is localization and identification of vertebrae in benchmark human CT.},

abstract = {It has now been convincingly demonstrated that ovarian carcinoma subtypes are not a single disease but comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms. Whole slide images of tissue sections are used clinically for diagnosing biologically distinct subtypes, as opposed to different grades of the same disease. This new grading scheme for ovarian carcinomas results in a low to moderate interobserver agreement among pathologists. In practice, the majority of cases are diagnosed at advanced stages and the overall prognosis is typically poor. In this work, we propose an automatic system for the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma subtypes from large-scale histopathology images. Our novel approach uses an unsupervised feature learning framework composed of a sparse tissue representation and a discriminative feature encoding scheme. We validate our model on a challenging clinical dataset of 80 patients and demonstrate its ability to diagnose whole slide images with an average accuracy of 91% using a linear support vector machine classifier.},

abstract = {Medulloblastoma MB is a type of brain cancer that represent roughly 25% of all brain tumors in children. In the anaplastic medulloblastoma subtype, it is important to identify the degree of irregularity and lack of organizations of cells as this correlates to disease aggressiveness and is of clinical value when evaluating patient prognosis. This paper presents an image representation to distinguish these subtypes in histopathology slides. The approach combines learned features from i an unsupervised feature learning method using topographic independent component analysis that captures scale, color and translation invariances, and ii learned linear combinations of Riesz wavelets calculated at several orders and scales capturing the granularity of multiscale rotation-covariant information. The contribution of this work is to show that the combination of two complementary approaches for feature learning unsupervised and supervised improves the classification performance. Our approach outperforms the best methods in literature with statistical significance, achieving 99% accuracy over region-based data comprising 7,500 square regions from 10 patient studies diagnosed with medulloblastoma 5 anaplastic and 5 non-anaplastic.},

abstract = {Microsurgery is technically challenging, demanding both rigorous precision under the operating microscope and great care when handling tissue. Applying excessive force can result in irreversible tissue injury, but sufficient force must be exerted to carry out manoeuvres in an efficient manner. Technological advances in hand-held instruments have allowed the integration of force sensing capabilities into surgical tools, resulting in the possibility of force feedback during an operation. This paper presents a novel method of graduated online visual force-feedback for hand-held microsurgical instruments. Unlike existing visual force-feedback techniques, the force information is integrated into the surgical scene by highlighting the area around the point of contact while preserving salient anatomical features. We demonstrate that the proposed technique can be integrated seamlessly with image guidance techniques. Critical anatomy beyond the exposed tissue surface is revealed using an augmented reality overlay when the user is exerting large forces within their proximity. The force information is further used to improve the quality of the augmented reality by displacing the overlay based on the forces exerted. Detailed user studies were performed to assess the efficacy of the proposed method.},

abstract = {A pixel-by-pixel scanning that is usually performed by a single point-like sensor or probe is being widely used in the applications such as scanning probe microscopy techniques. Typically, their scanning time is several seconds to minutes long due to a raster scanning that needs to be conducted for capturing every single point on the surface of the sample area. To improve the scanning efficiency, recent research has been focused on investigating effective scanning patterns and methods. This work presents an adaptive local scanning method for efficiently sampling indiscrete objects like string-like one-piece connected objects under the microscopy. An initial scanning pattern is firstly investigated. Once the initial scanning reaches the object, an adaptive sinusoidal scanning method that can on-line adjust its scanning frequency and amplitude by predicting both the curvatures and the shape of the object is employed. The method also addresses scanning intersections and bifurcations associated with objects. Based on extensive implementations, it is validated that our method has high performance as it has high scanning efficiency and the scanned results match objects with high precision and high accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe design and experimental results of repetitive calibration of an holonomic inchworm robot based on an inverse trajectory analysis of a tip of a probe for microscopic operations. The mobile robot has two U-shaped electromagnets and four piezoelectric actuators (PAs) for obtaining 3-degrees-of-freedom (3DoF) motion on well-polished ferromagnetic surfaces. We have proposed the kinematic model to get relationship among four input voltages to PAs and three displacements of the robot at a half step. We have also solved the inverse trajectory analysis of the probe to convert the motion errors of the probe into those of the robot. Moreover, we have proposed repetitive calibration formulas to calibrate 3DoF motion of the probe under a microscope simultaneously. In experiments, we have checked that the proposed formulas are surely working for decreasing the motion errors at straight motion although rotation around the tip is hard to calibrate because of its posture measuring error of an image processor. We discuss compact and flexible microscopic operations.},

abstract = {While vehicle automation has the potential to significantly improve safety and traffic efficiency, the full potential will only be realised when vehicles start exploiting wireless communication to cooperate with each other and coordinate their interactions in advance. Ensuring that vehicles coordinate safely while improving efficiency is, however, a very challenging problem as it depends on (i) the characteristics of individual vehicles (vehicle physics, sensors), (ii) unreliable wireless communication, and (iii) driving behaviour at a microscopic level, and their compounded effects at scale. The presence of non-communicative, non-automated vehicles must also be considered. Designing and evaluating coordination protocols requires a scalable simulation framework that is accurate both microscopically (to assess safety) and macroscopically (to evaluate efficiency). Standard car-following models, where position and velocity are dictated by local input stimuli, produce sometimes unrealistic behaviour when laterally changing position, and lack support for additional inputs. Furthermore, conventional environments used to model traffic flow are either too fine-grained to scale or too coarse to appropriately simulate control logic. This paper introduces RoundaSim consisting of (i) a traffic simulator using a novel approach of mixed discrete-continuous modes of time, and (ii) a framework for implementing car-following models that supports lane-changing and coordination protocols, with additional inputs from advanced sensors and wireless communications. We show how our framework can be used to implement and evaluate a car-following model with lane changes and validate that the traffic flow achieved approximates that of real-world highways. This allows our platform to be used as a baseline for evaluating the safety and efficiency of coordination protocols.},

abstract = {The increasing market penetration of in-vehicle sensor technology, e.g., cameras and lidars, is likely to provide more and more insights on drivers' behaviours. Real time knowledge of drivers' behaviour can be useful to a wide range of applications, such as driving assistance in traffic situations identified as critical, detection of tiredness levels or identification of drivers for insurance purposes. In situations where drivers only interact with other vehicles, for instance on highways, the drivers' behaviours can be modelled through microscopic car-following models. Those models are known to be able to capture the physical features of traffic flow, while accurately describing specific drivers' behaviour via behavioural parameters. A lot of research to date has focused on fitting the parameters of these models to real trajectory datasets using off-line techniques, with the objective to reproduce drivers variability in simulation. However very little has been published on online parameter estimation of car-following models. This paper investigates how in-vehicle sensors could help estimate car-following behavioural parameters. The focus is on the Intelligent Driver Model. A discussion of the sensitivity of the estimation is provided in light of previous work, and it is argued that, depending on the traffic state, not all the parameters need to be calibrated. An extended Kalman filter with physical inequality constraints on the behavioural parameters is then formulated for the class of time continuous car-following models. The filter exhibits systematic convergence for real trajectories of leaders and synthetic-simulated-trajectories of followers, for randomly picked parameters within the physical bounds, and for fixed and dynamic observation time steps ranging from 0.1 s up to 1 s. This demonstrates that online parameter estimation of behavioural parameters has great potential.},

The keypoints are extracted from R, G and B components and collectively form discriminative visual features. In the classification task, the paper proposes two-stage classification. In stage-I sample is classified as normal or cancerous. In stage-II, if the sample is annotated as cancerous, it gets further classified according to its type that is, either invasive or in-situ. The method showed stage-I performance as 74.28% for normal and 90.39% for cancerous images. In Stage-II, accuracy for invasive and in-situ types is 98.86% and 84.09% respectively.},

Acute myelogenous leukemia (a type of leukemia) has eight sub-types according to French-American-British classification. These forms can be visually observed by pathologists using microscopic images of infected cells. However, identification task is tedious and usually difficult due to varying features. Automatic leukemia detection is an important topic in the domain of cancer diagnosis. This paper presents a novel method based on dictionary learning and sparse representation for detecting and classification of different sub-types of AML. For each class, two intensity and label dictionaries are designed for representation using image patches of training samples. New image is represented by all dictionaries and the one with minimum error determine the type of class. We considered M2, M3 and M5 sub-types for evaluation of the method. The initial implementing of the proposed method achieved 97.53% average accuracy for different sub-types of AML.},

Finally, a histogram representation, which considers the signs and magnitudes of the responses as well as the number of filters, is applied on local image patches. We propose to apply this idea to a microscopy image pixel identification system based on a learning framework.

Fluorescence microscopy is used to study the dynamics of internal proteins and ions, but this often produces images with missing parts of the pollen tube. Brightfield microscopy provides a low-cost way of obtaining structural information about the pollen tube, but the images are crowded with false edges. We propose a dynamic segmentation fusion scheme that uses both Bright-field and Fluorescence images of growing pollen tubes to get a unified segmentation. Knowledge of the image formation process is used to create an initial estimate of the location of the cell boundary. Fusing this estimate with an edge indicator function amplifies desired edges and attenuates undesired edges. The cell boundary is obtained using Level Set evolution on the fused edge indicator function. Experimental testing shows that this fusion produces significantly better results than those obtained without it.},

In a context where budget and time constraints increase at each project, quality requirements stay the same: generate believable character animations at the microscopic level while ensuring that the overall crowd simulation stays coherent at the macroscopic level.Golaem Crowd is an artist-oriented crowd simulation plugin for Autodesk Maya. Amongst the various tools embedded in the software, it includes a dedicated character animation engine. Golaem Crowd animation engine allows real-time motion retargeting as well as interactive motion synchronization and blending. In this paper, the motion retargeting workflow is detailed, as well as its features and how it helps solving production constraints by reducing the number of assets to create and by facilitating the reuse of assets.},

abstract = {Rapid advancements in biotechnologies such as -omic (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics etc.), next generation sequencing, bio-nanotechnologies, molecular imaging, and mobile sensors etc. accelerate the data explosion in biomedicine and health wellness. Multiple nations around the world have been seeking novel effective ways to make sense of "big data" for evidence-based, outcome-driven, and affordable 5P (Patient-centric, Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Precise) healthcare. My main research focus is on multi-modal and multi-scale (i.e. molecular, cellular, whole body, individual, and population) biomedical data analytics for discovery, development, and delivery, including translational bioinformatics in biomarker discovery for personalized care; imaging informatics in histopathology for clinical diagnosis decision support; bionanoinformatics for minimally-invasive image-guided surgery; critical care informatics in ICU for real-time evidence-based decision making; and chronic care informatics for patient-centric health. In this talk, first, I will highlight major challenges in biomedical and health informatics pipeline consisting of data quality control, information feature extraction, advanced knowledge modeling, decision making, and proper action taking through feedback. Second, I will present informatics methodological research in (i) data integrity and integration; (ii) case-based reasoning for individualized care; and (iii) streaming data analytics for real-time decision support using a few mobile health case studies (e.g. Sickle Cell Disease, asthma, pain management, rehabilitation, diabetes etc.). Last, there is big shortage of data scientists and engineers who are capable of handling Big Data. In addition, there is an urgent need to educate healthcare stakeholders (i.e. patients, physicians, payers, and hospitals) on how to tackle these grant challenges. I will discuss efforts such as patient-centric educational intervention, community-based crowd sourcing, and Biomedical Data Analytics MOOC development. Our research has been supported by NIH, NSF, Georgia Research Alliance, Georgia Cancer Coalition, Emory-Georgia Tech Cancer Nanotechnology Center, Children's Health Care of Atlanta, Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute, and industrial partners such as Microsoft Research and HP.},

abstract = {Collecting ground-truth or gold standard annotations from expert pathologists for developing histopathology analytic algorithms and computer-aided diagnosis for cancer grading is an expensive and time consuming process. Efficient visualization and annotation tools are needed to enable groundtruthing large whole-slide imagery. KOLAM is our scalable, cross-platform framework for interactive visualization of 2D, 2D+t and 3D imagery of high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. In the current work KOLAM has been extended to support rapid interactive labelling and correction of automatic image classifier-based region labels of the tissue microenvironment by pathologists. Besides annotating regions-of-interest (ROIs), KOLAM enables extraction of the corresponding large polygonal image subregions for input into automatic segmentation algorithms, single-click region label reassignment and maintaining hierarchical image subregions. Experience indicates that clinicians prefer simple-to-use interfaces that support rapid labelling of large image regions with minimal effort. The incorporation of easy-to-use tissue annotation features in KOLAM makes it an attractive candidate for integration within a multi-stage histopathology image analysis pipeline supporting assisted segmentation and labelling to improve whole-slide imagery (WSI) analytics.},

abstract = {Following healthy lifestyle is a key for active living. Regular exercise, controlled diet and sound sleep play an invisible role on the well being and independent living of the people. Sleep being the most durative activities of daily living (ADL) has a major synergistic influence on people's mental, physical and cognitive health. Understanding the sleep behavior longitudinally and its underpinning clausal relationships with physiological signals and contexts (such as eye or body movement etc.) horizontally responsible for a sound or disruptive sleep pattern help provide meaningful information for promoting healthy lifestyle and designing appropriate intervention strategy. In this paper we propose to detect the microscopic states of the sleep which fundamentally constitute the components of a good or bad sleeping behavior and help shape the formative assessment of sleep quality. We initially investigate several classification techniques to identify and correlate the relationship of microscopic sleep states with the overall sleep behavior. Subsequently we propose an online algorithm based on change point detection to better process and classify the microscopic sleep states and then test a lightweight version of this algorithm for real time sleep monitoring activity recognition and assessment at scale. For a larger deployment of our proposed model across a community of individuals we propose an active learning based methodology by reducing the effort of ground truth data collection. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms on real data traces, and demonstrate the efficacy of our models for detecting and assessing fine-grained sleep states beyond an individual.},

Inspired by co segmentation, this paper presents a new method to obtain the entire WBC contour in order to solve the adhesion problem. Firstly, the color space transformation and thresholding are employed to obtain sub images. Among them, a sub image called reference image only includes plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), while the others contain WBCs. Then, a similarity measurement is introduced into the region-based active contour model in order to co segment between the reference image and the other sub images. Due to full use of cross information, such as color and shape, the proposed method has been successfully applied to a large number of microscopic cell images, showing promising segmentation results for diverse cell appearance and image quality.},

Mechanical properties of EPDM composite in the state of pyrolysis are investigated by uniaxial tensile tests. At the state of initial pyrolysis, composite belongs to the category of hyperelastic-viscoelastic material. The tendency of tensile strength increased and elongation decreased with increasing of heating temperature. Composite behaves as the linear rule at the state of late pyrolysis, which belongs to the category of bittle. The elasticity modulus of curves are almost the same while the heating temperature ranges from 200°C to 300°C, and then gradually go down. The tensile strength of pyrolytic material reach the highest at the heating temperature of 300°C, and the virgin material has the largest elongation.},

The construction of such mesh structures for plant tissues iscurrently a missing step in the existing image analysis pipelines. We propose a method for optimizing thesurface triangular meshes representing the tissue simultaneously along several criteria, based on an initiallow-quality mesh. The mesh geometry is deformed by iteratively minimizing an energy functional definedover this discrete surface representation. This optimization results in a light discrete representation of thecell surfaces that enables fast visualization, and quantitative analysis, and gives way to in silico physical andmechanical simulations on real-world data. We provide a framework for evaluating the quality of the celltissue reconstruction, that underlines the ability of our method to fit multiple optimization criteria.},

It is developed for the context of self study. In a prior study, we have reported that students learning with LEMA showed statistically significant difference in their learning outcomes on a modeling ability based test than the control group. While we know that LEMA helped develop students modeling skills, the prior study did not address how it helped or why. In order to gain insight into this, in this study we investigate the different paths that different learners take as they interact with LEMA. Using screen capture logs of students' interaction with LEMA, we characterize the difference in behavior between students who score low and students who score high in a modeling based post test. We find that in spite of the fact that the total time spent by all students while interacting with LEMA is the same, the duration of time spent on each feature of LEMA and the action taken within, varies for high and low scorers.},

abstract = {We discuss the advantages of using Julia for solving multiscale problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). Multiscale problems are problems where the coefficients of a PDE oscillate rapidly on a microscopic length scale, but solutions are sought on a much larger, macroscopic domain. Solving multiscale problems requires both a theoretic result, i.e., a homogenization result yielding effective coefficients, as well as numerical solutions of the PDE at the microscopic and the macroscopic length scales.Numerical homogenization of PDEs with stochastic coefficients is especially computationally expensive. Under certain assumptions, effective coefficients can be found, but their calculation involves subtle numerical problems. The computational cost is huge due to the generally large number of stochastic dimensions.Multiscale problems arise in many applications, e.g., in uncertainty quantification, in the rational design of nanoscale sensors, and in the rational design of materials.Our code for the numerical stochastic homogenization of elliptic problems is implemented in Julia. Since multiscale problems pose new numerical problems, it is in any case necessary to develop new numerical codes. Julia is a dynamic language inspired by the Lisp family of languages, it is open-source, and it provides native-code compilation, access to highly optimized linear-algebra routines, support for parallel computing, and a powerful macro system. We describe our experience in using Julia and discuss the advantages of Julia's features in this problem domain.},

In this paper, we propose a framework to grade metastatic liver histology images based on the spatial organization inter and intra regions. After detecting the presence of metastases, we first decompose the image into regions corresponding to the tissue types (sane, cancerous, vessels and gaps). A sample of each type is further decomposed into the contained biological objects (nuclei, stroma, gaps). The spatial relations between all the pairs of regions and objects are measured using a Force Histogram Decomposition. A specimen is described using a Bag of Words model aggregating the features measured on all its randomly acquired images. The grading is made using a Naive Bayes Classifier. Experiments on a 23 mice dataset with CT26 intrasplenic tumors highlight the relevance of the spatial relations with a correct grading rate of .},

This background removal process is fundamental for the analysis of cell mobility as the periodic background pattern would otherwise lead to erroneous cell analysis. The detection of the background is performed by searching for the periodic background pattern organization through the analysis of keypoints automatically obtained from images. Using this information we are able to both detect and reconstruct the periodic background and finally remove it from the original images.We tested the proposed approach on microscopy images with different periodic background patterns. The effectiveness of the method was validated both by visual inspection and by the cell tracking results obtained.},

abstract = {This paper is interested in the analysis and the debugging of decentralized asynchronous large-scale multi-agent systems. In order to work at scale, such a task requires computer scientists to abstract away from the agent microscopic dynamics by providing a global representation of the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose to address this challenging need by designing description devices that reduce the microscopic complexity of the system descriptions. This approach is applied to the aggregation of the microscopic causal features that constitute the execution of a given multi-agent system: spatial and temporal abstractions are built from the observation of microscopic interactions in order to provide a global understanding of the system trajectory. The scaling issue is then handled by observational devices that directly compute such macroscopic descriptions without collecting any microscopic data. This macroscopic observation process is evaluated on a classic ant colony model.},

abstract = {Biological multi-channel microscopy data are often characterized by a high local entropy and phenotypically identical structures covering only a few pixels and forming disjoint regions spread over, e.g., a cell or a tissue section. Toponome data as an example, comprise a fluorescence image (channel) per protein affinity reagent, and capture the location and spatial distribution of proteins in cells and tissues. Biologists investigate such data using a region-of-interest in an image view and a linked view displaying information aggregated or derived from the channels. The cognitive effort of moving the attention back and forth between the views is immense.We present an approach for the in-place annotation of multi-channel microscopy data in 2D views. We combine dynamic excentric labeling and static necklace maps to cope with the special characteristics of these data. The generated annotations support the biologists in visually exploring multi-channel information directly in its spatial context. A label is generated per unique phenotype included in a flexible, moveable focus region. The labels are organized in a circular fashion around the focus region. On demand, a nested labeling can be generated by displaying a second ring of labels which represents the channels characterizing the focused phenotypes. We demonstrate our approach by toponome data of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line and a prostate tissue section.},

abstract = {With a view to achieve stable production, nowadays the process design and planning goes through a time and resource intensive correction loop. The process output after machining trials is used to determine the critical process sections, and hence the experience of the process designer is decisive in the productivity of the optimization loop and the process. The implementation of a machining simulation can enhance the productivity of the process design and planning phase. The macroscopic engagement simulation provides an efficient tool for process evaluation. Moreover, it provides a basis for derivation of microscopic geometric process parameters, which have a direct correlation to mechanical and thermal loads. Thus, detailed information relating to the cutting loads on the tool is derivable at every point on the toolpath, enabling analysis of NC machining process based purely on the macroscopic geometric engagement between the cutting tool and workpiece. This information regarding the engagement conditions can be used to proactively identify potential critical process sections in a virtual environment thereby increasing the process reliability. Thus a process design for an optimal tool load is possible resulting in improved tool life, process efficiency and reduction in utilised resources.},

abstract = {In this paper a new portable Digital In-line Holography Platform for biological micro-scale imaging of sperm samples is presented. This platform is based on the shadow imaging principle, where biological samples are illuminated by a nearly coherent light source, and shadows are recorded into a CMOS imaging sensor with no lens requirement. The projected shadows present holographic signatures, storing more than bi-dimensional information of the analyzed sample. To improve resolution and suppress noise of the acquired holograms, a multi-frame technique based on high-dynamic range imaging combined with summation of consecutive frames over time was used. Finally, decoding of holograms is performed by an efficient and fast phase-recovery method, where morphological details of the sample can be obtained similarly a conventional bright-field microscopy image. From an image formation point of view, the proposed portable approach is able to visualize biological samples in high synthetic numerical aperture values with a spatial resolution of 1 -- 2 μm on a field-of-view of approx.30 mm2. This field-of-view is consistently bigger than a conventional microscope imaged area with no mosaic reconstruction, and the achieved resolution is obtained using a single illumination source with no moving parts, array of LEDs or sift of the light source. Validation of the proposed portable approach was performed using various human samples, where conventional microscopy was used for confirmation purposes.},

abstract = {The improvement of bioimaging technologies enables the observation of cellular dynamics invivo. Some new bioimaging technologies are expected to contribute to the discovery of new drugs and mechanisms of disease. To improve the contributions of bioimaging, it is required to extract a particular region or to detect a particular cell's motion within bioimages. Moreover, automatic extraction and detection with image processing is also required because the accurate and uniformed processing of a massive number of images manually is unrealistic. To help automate this process, we introduce a bone marrow cavity segmentation method for two-photon excitation microscopy images. Specialists of cellular dynamics define regions of bone marrow cavity by considering several criteria, including characteristics of intensity and blood flow. We take those criteria into our method as the energy function of graph cuts. Results of evaluations and comparison with normal graph cuts show that our proposed method that does not use hard constraints achieved a performance better than normal graph cuts with hard constraints.},

abstract = {Bio-imaging techniques have recently gotten a lot of attention since they have enabled in-vivo imaging. They are expected to contribute to drug discovery, understanding of disease mechanisms etc. However, data retrieved by bioimaging techniques have been increasing in volume, and it is not anymore feasible to analyze it manually. Therefore automatic extraction of characteristic of a huge amount of data have become important. Moreover, quantitative analysis methods are required for statistical reliability. In this paper we introduce a method for the analysis of a sequence of bone tissue images taken by a two-photon microscope to quantify blood permeability of bone marrow. This method segments the input image sequence to blood vessel, bone marrow and bone regions by graph cuts which we extended according to the images. Permeability is quantified by the intensity of the segmentation result. We also confirm that our method shows that quantification tendency is similar to ground truth data made by an expert.},

abstract = {We present a method for simulating lower quality images starting from higher quality ones, based on acquired image pairs from different optical setups. The method does not require estimates of point (or line) spread functions of the system, but utilizes the relative transfer function derived from images of real specimen of interest in the observed application. Thanks to the use of a larger number of real specimen, excellent stability and robustness of the method is achieved. The intended use is exploring the influence of image quality on features and classification accuracy in pattern recognition based screening tasks. Visual evaluation of the obtained images strongly confirms usefulness of the method. The approach is quantitatively evaluated by observing stability of feature values, proven useful for PAP-smear classification, between synthetic and real images from seven different microscope setups. The evaluation shows that features from the synthetically generated lower resolution images are as similar to features from real images at that resolution, as features from two different images of the same specimen, taken at the same low resolution, are to each other.},

abstract = {Zebra fish, as a popular experimental model organism, has been frequently used in biomedical research. For observing, analysing and recording labelled transparent features in zebra fish images, it is often efficient and convenient to adopt the fluorescence microscopy. However, the acquired z-stack images are always blurred, which makes deblurring/deconvolution critical for further image analysis. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) method with the sparse image priors to solve three-dimensional (3D) deconvolution problem for Wide Field (WF) fluorescence microscopy images from zebra fish embryos. The novel sparse image priors include a global Hyper-Laplacian model and a local smooth region mask. These two kinds of prior are deployed for preserving sharp edges and suppressing ringing artifacts, respectively. Both synthetic and real WF fluorescent zebra fish embryo data are used for evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed method for 3D fluorescence microscopy images, compared with state-of-the-art 3D deconvolution algorithms.},

Led by this question, the author performed a microscopic observation of the knowledge creation process on the recent article, "Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster." The author collected not only the revision history of the article but also investigated interactions between collaborators by making a user-paragraph network to reveal an intellectual intervention of multiple authors. The knowledge creation process on the Wikipedia article was categorized into 4 major steps and 6 phases from the beginning to the intellectual balance point where only revisions were made. To represent this phenomenon, the author developed a visaphor (digital visual metaphor) to digitally represent the article's evolving concepts and characteristics. Then the author created a dynamic digital information visualization using particle effects and network graph structures. The visaphor reveals the interaction between users and their collaborative efforts as they created and revised paragraphs and debated aspects of the article.},

abstract = {We study and characterize the performance of operations in an important class of applications on GPUs and Many Integrated Core (MIC) architectures. Our work is motivated by applications that analyze low-dimensional spatial datasets captured by high resolution sensors, such as image datasets obtained from whole slide tissue specimens using microscopy scanners. Common operations in these applications involve the detection and extraction of objects (object segmentation), the computation of features of each extracted object (feature computation), and characterization of objects based on these features (object classification). In this work, we have identify the data access and computation patterns of operations in the object segmentation and feature computation categories. We systematically implement and evaluate the performance of these operations on modern CPUs, GPUs, and MIC systems for a microscopy image analysis application. Our results show that the performance on a MIC of operations that perform regular data access is comparable or sometimes better than that on a GPU. On the other hand, GPUs are significantly more efficient than MICs for operations that access data irregularly. This is a result of the low performance of MICs when it comes to random data access. We also have examined the coordinated use of MICs and CPUs. Our experiments show that using a performance aware task strategy for scheduling application operations improves performance about 1.29 over a first-come-first-served strategy. This allows applications to obtain high performance efficiency on CPU-MIC systems - the example application attained an efficiency of 84% on 192 nodes (3072 CPU cores and 192 MICs).},

abstract = {Performance is one of the major concerns in large-scale parallel microscopic traffic simulations. This paper focuses on one of the most time-costly data structures: the two-dimensional spatial index. A drawback of using popular two-dimensional tree-based spatial indexes (e.g. the R*-Tree) in large-scale microscopic traffic simulation is the heavy cost to rebalance the tree structure when a large number of vehicles frequently update their locations. This heavy location update cost also reduces the scalability of parallel microscopic traffic simulations. We observe that in real-world traffic systems the road density during a short period is stable, which is not sensitive to an individual vehicle's location. Thus, why not build a balanced tree structure based on the average road density in a road network? Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes Sim-Tree. The key feature of the Sim-Tree is that there is no need to check or rebalance its tree structure when individual vehicles frequently update their locations. In addition, a rebalance function and a bottom-up region query function are designed to optimize Sim-Tree's region query operations. The results of experiments simulating a city-scale traffic scenario on a 6-core machine show that the Sim-Tree is scalable and performs significantly better than the R*-tree family of spatial indexes.},

The epidermis becomes fine-drawn and the dermal network deteriorates with decades. The three-dimensional structure of elastic network and the hyaluronic acid distribution are so complex, rich and dense that the conventional observation ways can only provide partial view of these components.Objective: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the morphological differences between two abdominal skin samples coming from young and aged donors based on elastic fibers organization and hyaluronic acid distribution.Methods: The SkinExplorer™ platform performs immersive and interactive exploration with virtual reality applications.Results: 2mm3 of histological data were obtained from 40 serial histological sections. Two three-dimensional numerical models from respectively young and aged skin biopsies were reconstructed. The observations were realized on the epidermis and dermal elastic fibers with the SkinExplorer™ platform and virtual reality (VR) applications. For hyaluronic acid repartition, two smaller models were reconstructed to see their richness and density by the same platform and VR tools.Conclusion: These results suggest that Virtual Reality applications can be a good tool for the observation of aging process with its assessing and understanding. Moreover, this tool of exploration offers new way of micro-anatomical research.},

abstract = {Homophily is a phenomenon observed very frequently in social networks and is related with the inclination of people to be involved with others that exhibit similar characteristics. The roots of homophily can be subtle and are mainly traced back to two mechanisms: (i) social selection and (ii) peer influence. Decomposing the effects of each of these mechanisms requires analysis of longitudinal data. This has been a burden to similar studies in traditional social sciences due to the hardness of collecting such information. However, the proliferation of online social media has enabled the collection of massive amounts of information related with human activities. In this work, we are interested in examining the forces of the above mechanisms in the context of the locations visited by people. For our study, we use a longitudinal dataset collected from Gowalla, a location-based social network (LBSN). LBSNs, unlike other online social media, bond users' online interactions with their activities in real-world, physical locations. Prior work on LBSNs has focused on the influence of geographical constraints on the formation of social ties. On the contrary, in this paper, we perform a microscopic study of the peer influence and social selection mechanisms in LBSNs. Our analysis indicates that while the similarity of friends' spatial trails at a geographically global scale cannot be attributed to peer influence, the latter can explain up to 40% of the geographically localized similarity between friends. Moreover, this percentage depends on the type of locations we examine, and it can be even higher for specific categories (e.g., nightlife spots). Finally, we find that the social selection mechanism, is only triggered by places that exhibit specific network characteristics. We believe that our work can have significant implications on obtaining a deeper understanding of the way that people create friendships, act and move in real space, which can further facilitate and enhance applications such as recommender systems, trip planning and marketing.},

abstract = {Optical microscopy is widely used for cancer cell detection via biopsy. Unfortunately this technique requires a large number of samples to determine the grade of the cancer cells. Because time is critical in this operation, a search for a method to reduce the length of this process is important. One such method showing promise is the implementation of the snake method for cancer cell detection. Ideally, this method will aim toward minimizing cost while maximizing efficiency. Using optical microscopy at LCOMS, we performed a proof-of-concept study to distinguish between normal and abnormal cells. We developed a snake/active contour method by which several curves move within images in order to find normal/abnormal cell boundaries. Abnormal cell identification typically takes more than one hour; however. The implementation of field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology solves this problem. A novel embedded architecture of the snake method is developed for an efficient and fast computation of active contour used in high throughput image analysis applications, where time performance is critical. This architecture allows for a scalable and a totally embedded processing on FPGA of a large number of images. The architecture of the snake method is able to detect objects from images which have irregular shapes, such as carcinoma cell types. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, the architecture is implemented on Xilinx ISE 12.3-FPGA technology using Verilog hardware description language (VHDL). The very promising results using Snake method implementation and real cancer cell images from optical microscopy demonstrate the potentials of our approach.},

abstract = {Traditionally, expert analysis is required to evaluate pathological changes manifested in tissue biopsies. This is a highly-skilled process, notwithstanding issues of limited throughput and inter-operator variability, thus the application of image analysis algorithms to this domain may drive innovation in disease diagnostics. There are a number of problems facing the development of objective, unsupervised methods in morphometry that must be overcome. In the first instance, we decided to focus on one aspect of skin histopathology, that of collagen structure, as changes in collagen organisation have myriad pathological sequelae, including delayed wound healing and fibrosis. Methods to quantify incremental loss in structure are desirable, particularly as subclinical changes may be difficult to assess using existing criteria. For example, collagen structure is known to change with age, and through the calculation of foci distances in ellipses derived from the Fourier scatter, we were able to measure a decrease in collagen bundle thickness in picrosirius stained skin with age. Another key indicator of skin physiology is new collagen synthesis, which is necessary to maintain a healthy integument. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed a colour-based image segmentation method to discriminate newly-synthesised from established collagen revealed by Herovici\^{a} s polychrome staining. Our scheme is adaptive to variations in hue and intensity, and our use of K-means clustering and intensity-based colour filtering informed the segmentation and quantification of red (indicating old fibres) and blue pixels (indicating new fibres). This allowed the determination of the ratio of young to mature collagen fibres in the dermis, revealing an age-related reduction in new collagen synthesis. These automated colour and frequency domain methods are tractable to high-throughput analysis and are independent of operator variability.},

abstract = {Image segmentation is crucial to modern cell biology which depends on quantitative analysis of fluorescent microscopy images. Segmented regions are useful to estimate localization and dynamics of cells and sub-cellular objects. Although many segmentation algorithms have been proposed in image processing and pattern recognition fields, most approaches are designed for some specific tasks and may not work well for other tasks. This makes it difficult to find an algorithm suitable for a given task for biologists who do not have knowledge about segmentation algorithms. Automatic selection of an appropriate segmentation algorithm including its parameters efficiently has become a very important duty, since recent advances in cell and sub-cellular imaging technology significantly increases a number of observed images for biologists. In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation system which has the function of performance evaluation. The set of candidate algorithms including parameter variation are automatically generated by using combinations of the prescribed image processing methods implemented in our system, and the system is designed in order to add and replace these algorithms easily. Their segmentation qualities are evaluated by comparing each result with the ground-truth provided by biologists based on either a single or multiple similarity metrics. Finally, our system predicts which algorithm will provide the best performance on a set of images similar to the original image with ground-truth reference. We examine our system using typical segmentation algorithms under several evaluation metrics and find it useful especially for detection of fluorescent labeled targets with granular shapes on real sub-cellular images, as well as simulated images with small sub-cellular objects.},

abstract = {This paper presents a learning approach for detecting nematocysts in Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. The image dataset was collected and made available to us by biologists for the purposes of morphological studies of corals, jellyfish, and other species in the phylum Cnidaria. Challenges for computer vision presented by this biological domain are rarely seen in general images of natural scenes. We formulate nematocyst detection as labeling of a regular grid of image patches. This structured prediction problem is specified within two frameworks: CRF and HC-Search. The CRF uses graph cuts for inference. The HC-Search approach is based on search in the space of outputs. It uses a learned heuristic function (H) to uncover high-quality candidate labelings of image patches, and then uses a learned cost function (C) to select the final prediction among the candidates. While locally optimal CRF inference may be sufficient for images of natural scenes, our results demonstrate that CRF with graph cuts performs poorly on the nematocyst images, and that HC-Search outperforms CRF with graph cuts. This suggests biological images of flexible objects present new challenges requiring further ad- vances of, or alternatives to existing methods.},

We demonstrate our technique on 3D fluorescence microscopy data of Drosophila embryos for which we are able to produce extremely accurate semantic segmentations in a matter of minutes, and for which other algorithms fail due to the size and high-dimensionality of the data, or due to the difficulty of the task.},

TraffSim is able to use various network types from multilane motorways to dense city road networks including multiple types of junctions or one-way streets and provides great extensibility and flexibility for both developers and users. Moreover, it allows free definition of vehicle properties like dimensions or engine features, which are used by several applicable models for longitudinal movement, lane-changing and fuel-consumption.

Together with simulation and analysis, visualization provides researchers with a powerful "computational microscope". Petascale molecular dynamics simulations produce tens to hundreds of terabytes of data that can be impractical to transfer to remote facilities, making it necessary to perform visualization and analysis tasks in-place on the supercomputer where the data are generated. We describe the adaptation of key visualization features of VMD, a widely used molecular visualization and analysis tool, for GPU-accelerated petascale computers. We discuss early experiences adapting ray tracing algorithms for GPUs, and compare rendering performance for recent petascale molecular simulation test cases on Cray XE6 (CPU-only) and XK7 (GPU-accelerated) compute nodes.

In our rendering system, the normal distribution function (NDF) of the surface bumps is expressed via mixtures of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, while the corresponding perturbation of refracted rays (RDF) can be approximated as a spherical warp of NDF, taking into account correction factors. Under the assumption of two-sided refraction, we first generate the vMF lobes of the front surface refraction. Based on these lobes, we then estimate the RDF of back surface as a warped convolution of macroscopic and microscopic NDFs within the footprint of each lobe. Moreover, summed-area tables and dual-paraboloid maps are adopted to efficiently represent the environmental lighting in order to support fully dynamic lighting conditions. We finally get a coherent rendering at the different scales that reproduces high-quality meso- and micro-geometric effects under real-time performance.},

In this paper, we present an approach to detect broadenoma mammary gland tumors in cats using ant colony optimisation. Image features can then be extracted from the segmented image regions. To evaluate the performance of our presented approach, 25 microscopical images were taken from tissue slides of broadenomas from three cat cases.

In this paper, we propose a set of parameters for evaluating the uniformity, density and agglomeration of particle distribution which is based on image processing. Distribution uniformity is evaluated by the value of coefficient of variationcv based on voronoi diagram, and by the eccentricity and deviation angle of particle distribution. The density of distribution is investigated via numerical density and area density which illustrate the area distribution at certain density levels. The assessment of agglomeration is carried out through the separation of particle distribution and the counting of different agglomeration situations. These three aspects of assessment will be demonstrated to fully describe the particle distribution. Microscopic images taken from chip on glassCOG are used to show the assessment process, and the characteristics of distribution can be obtained clearly and comprehensively.},

Although multiple methods have been developed to detect SSE from the density maps, accurate detection either need use intervention or carefully adjusting various parameters. It is still challenging to detect the SSE automatically and accurately from cryoEM density maps at medium resolutions (~5-10\r{A}). A detected β-sheet can be represented by either the voxels of the β-sheet density or by many piecewise polygons to compose a rough surface. However, none of these is effective in capturing the global surface feature of the β-sheet. We present an effective single-parameter approach, SSEtracer, to automatically identify helices and β-sheets from the cryoEM three-dimensional (3D) maps at medium resolutions. More importantly, we present a simple mathematical model to represent the β-sheet density. It was tested using eleven cryoEM β-sheets detected by SSEtracer. The RMSE between the density and the model is 1.88\r{A}. The mathematical model can be used for the β-strands detection from medium resolution density maps.},

Traditional simulation research has achieved great development, but most of them are based on ideal conditions which assume vehicles have little difference in dimension, maneuverability or other aspect.

In this paper, multi-agent method is used for typical mixed traffic microscopic simulation. The characteristics of mixed traffic are expressed in two ways: 1) different kinds of vehicle-agent models with different maximum-velocities, 2) fuzzy logic of driver agent that explicitly represents drivers' decision-making process of acceleration.

abstract = {In the last two decades, there have been studies claiming that science is becoming ever more interdisciplinary. However, the evidence has been anecdotal or partial. Here for the first time, we investigate a large size citation network of computer science domain with the intention to develop an automated unsupervised classification model that can efficiently distinguish the core and the interdisciplinary research fields. For this purpose, we propose four indicative features, three of these are directly related to the topological structure of the citation network, while the fourth is an external indicator based on the attractiveness of a field for the in-coming researchers. The significance of each of these features in characterizing interdisciplinary is measured independently and then systematically accumulated to build an unsupervised classification model. The result of the classification model shows two distinctive clusters that clearly distinguish core and interdisciplinary fields of computer science domain. Based on this classification, we further study the evolution dynamics at a microscopic level to show how interdisciplinarity emerges through cross-fertilization of ideas between the fields that otherwise have little overlap as they are mostly studied independently. Finally, to understand the overall impact of interdisciplinary research on the entire domain, we analyze selective citation based measurements of core and interdisciplinary fields, paper submission and acceptance statistics at top-tier conferences and the core-periphery structure of citation network, and observe an increasing impact of the interdisciplinary fields along with their steady integration with the computer science core in recent times.},

The counter separates the cell and background by histogram dual-threshold, fills the cell by Flood fill, and detects the cell using blob analysis. Then, using K-means clustering method segments the adherent cells. The highlight advantage of our proposed method is that it has good adaptability for different kinds of cells and strong robustness to light intensity. Experimental results show that the counter can quickly and correctly detect the number of cells and have good stability, regardless of the cell morphology, cell type and cell size.

abstract = {We present a general approach for solving the point-cloud matching problem for the case of mildly nonlinear transformations. Our method quickly finds a coarse approximation of the solution by exploring a reduced set of partial matches using an approach to which we refer to as Active Testing Search (ATS). We apply the method to registration of graph structures by branching point matching. It is based solely on the geometric position of the points, no additional information is used nor the knowledge of an initial alignment. In the second stage, we use dynamic programming to refine the solution. We tested our algorithm on angiography, retinal fundus, and neuronal data gathered using electron and light microscopy. We show that our method solves cases not solved by most approaches, and is faster than the remaining ones.},

Also, the paper calculates the fractal dimension of pore structure of He8 zone in Sulige gas field. The study results show that fractal feature of mercury injection capillary pressure curve has a property of two-stage with an obvious bend, which shows the double-porosity fractal. The fractal feature of mercury withdrawal of capillary pressure curve is single-stage. The measuring scale and measuring object have a good correlation property; Mercury injection fractal dimension De1, is closely related to slanting degrees and median radius. Mercury injection fractal dimension De2 doesn't have any relation to other basic parameters. Mercury withdrawal fractal dimension Dr relates to permeability and mercury withdrawal efficiency. The study shows that, by the analysis of De1 and Dr which can have a good reflection of microscopic pore structure, a convenient and effective way is obtained for the research on the microscopic heterogeneity of reservoir pore structure.},

abstract = {The segmentation of three-dimensional microscopic images of cardiac tissues provides important parameters for characterizing cardiac diseases and modeling of tissue function. Segmenting these images is, however, challenging. Currently only time-consuming manual approaches have been developed for this purpose. Here, we introduce an efficient approach for the semi-automatic segmentation (SAS) of cardiomyocytes and the extracellular space in image stacks obtained from confocal microscopy. The approach is based on a morphological watershed algorithm and iterative creation of watershed seed points on a distance map. Results of SAS were consistent with results from manual segmentation (Dice similarity coefficient: 90.8±2.6%). Cell volume was 4.6±6.5% higher in SAS cells, which mainly resulted from cell branches and membrane protrusions neglected by manual segmentation. We suggest that the novel approach constitutes an important tool for characterizing normal and diseased cardiac tissues. Furthermore, the approach is capable of providing crucial parameters for modeling of tissue structure and function.},

abstract = {Early fruit fly embryo development begins with the formation of a chemical blueprint that guides cellular movements and the development of organs and tissues. This blueprint sets the intrinsic spatial coordinates of the embryo. The coordinates are curvilinear from the start, becoming more curvilinear as cells start coherent movements several hours into development. This dynamic aspect of the curvature is an important characteristic of early embryogenesis: characterizing it is crucial for quantitative analysis and dynamic modeling of development. This presents a number of methodological problems for the elastic deformation of 3D and 4D data from confocal microscopy, to standardize images and follow temporal changes. The parameter searches for these deformations present hard optimization problems. Here we describe our evolutionary computation approaches to these problems. We outline some of the immediate applications of these techniques to crucial problems in Drosophila developmental biology.},

abstract = {The shape of biomolecules, such as proteins, may be represented using different representations like space-fill, ballstick, backbone, or secondary structures. The secondary structure of proteins, comprising of sheet-like, helix-like and loops structures, represent a higher level abstraction of its structure. With ever increasing sizes of protein structure data produced by high resolution x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, biologists often rely on visualizations to better understand the overall structure of proteins. In this paper, we present a unified framework for accelerating the rendering of various representations of these structure using GPUs. The framework first produces "impostor primitives", which are simple linear element approximations of quadric objects, such as spheres, cylinders, and helices. Next, the rasterizations of the impostors are corrected to produce pixel-precise renderings of the quadric objects. We incorporate this framework into a bio-molecular visualization tool proteinvis to demonstrate quantitative and qualitative performance gains over earlier approaches for rendering various representations of proteins.},

With the expansion of web services, denial of service (DoS) attacks by malicious automated programs (e.g. web bots) is becoming a serious problem of web service accounts. In order to avoid tremendous attack from malicious computer programs, HIP, or Human Interactive Proofs has been introduced to distinguish humans from computers. HIPs are designed to be easy for humans but hard for machines. Unfortunately, the existing HIPs tried to maximize the difficulty for automated programs to pass tests by increasing distortion or noise. Consequently, it has also become difficult for potential users too. In our proposed technique we resolve this problem by making use of human cognitive processing abilities through emoticons focusing mainly on users. Features like language independence, using this for advertising purpose, ease of use interface for the touch-based smart-phone users, easy tuning of security and usability level make it very attractive to web service providers. In the result section, a microscopic large-scale user study was conducted involving 118 users to investigate the actual user views compare to existing state of the art CAPTCHA systems like ESP-PIX and Asirra in terms of usability and security and found our system can be solved with 88.04% average success rate in less than 7 seconds.},

In this paper, we aim to study the impact factors that may affect the regularity and variability of human mobility patterns using social network analysis. Specifically, we introduce the spatial interaction matrix to represent the interaction strength and interaction semantics among spatial regions. Based on the spatial interaction matrix, we investigate the factors that impact the mobility patterns, including temporal factors, occupational factors and age factors. Our experimental results demonstrate that lots of factors such as environmental, temporal and age factors contribute to the shape of human mobility patterns.},

To improve the estimation accuracy, we proposed a Bayesian estimation method that introduces priors to the cell morphology and the force directions and simultaneously estimates the forces and the parameters with the expectation-maximization algorithm.

abstract = {Collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, is a basic component of the extracellular matrix and due to its unique properties it is widely used as biomaterial, scaffold and culture substrate for cell and tissue regeneration studies. Due to human skin chronic exposure to sun light and since UV rays are used as sterilizing and cross-linking methods the clarification of the UV light-collagen interactions are very crucial. Moreover, since the majority of the biological reactions occur on surfaces or interfaces the influence of UV light on the surface of collagenbased materials attracts the scientific interest, especially in the biomaterials science. Surface-nanoscale characterization could be performed with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which is a powerful tool and offers quantitative and qualitative information. Its ability of high resolution imaging and non-destructive characterization makes it very attractive for biological samples investigation. The aim of this paper was to determine the surface properties and alterations of collagen thin films after UV-irradiations using AFM techniques. Furthermore, it was aimed to investigate the possible different influence on the surface when the collagen solution or the thin films were irradiated. In this paper topographic AFM images were acquired from thin films, formed from both irradiated and non-irradiated collagen solutions, with spin coating procedure. The results demonstrated that the UV irradiation have different results when it is applied in the collagen solution or in the film after the spin coating methodology. For short irradiation times (&lt;120 min) UV caused only rather small changes in the morphology of the studied films although fluorescence and absorption studies confirmed collagen photodegradation. The surface roughness and topography altered after 3 and 7 hours, respectively, while the fibrous structure was completely destroyed after 15 hours. Surface roughness of the films depends on whether the solution was irradiated or the film and on the time irradiation. The fully clarification of the role of the UV light on collagen thin films will enable the proper design and control of collagen based nanobiomaterials with appropriate and improved surface properties.},

abstract = {Blood testing is one of the most important clinical examinations. Counting different blood cells is a significant process in a clinical laboratory. Manual microscopic evaluation is compulsory in case there is suspicious abnormality in the blood sample. Yet, the manual inspection is time-consuming and requires adequate technical knowledge. Therefore, automatic medical diagnosis systems are necessary to help physicians to diagnose diseases in a fast and nonetheless competent way. Cell automatic classification has wider interest especially for clinics and laboratories. Segmentation is the most important step for automatic classification success. This paper represents an efficient technique for automatic blood cell nuclei segmentation. This technique is relying on enhancing the color of the target object, nucleus, and filtering the image. Small objects are eliminated employing morphological operations. A set of 365 blood images was used to quantitatively evaluate this segmentation technique. Assessment of the proposed technique on the blood image set gives 85.4% accuracy. In comparison to other published technique that was implemented and executed on the same dataset, the proposed segmentation technique performance was found to be superior. A differential segmentation performance evaluation was performed on the five normal white blood cell types to compare isolated performance. Eosin Phil was found to have the highest segmentation accuracy with 90.1%. Lymphocyte and Basophil have the lowest accuracy with 78.3% and 78.6% respectively. The blood images dataset and the source code are published on MATLAB file exchange website for comparison and re-production.},

So it is easily affected by the external micro vibration, conversely, we can measure the micro vibration using the working principle of STM. As we all know, the tunneling effect is the negative index relation between the tunneling current and the tunneling gap. On the other hand, the vibration measurement results can be used to offer the foundation in order to reduce the influence of micro random vibration for STM, it is necessary to measure the external vibration to compensate the experiment results of scanning tunneling micros coy. So the experimental device is developed and experiment of vibration detection is made.

abstract = {Most state-of-the-art approaches to image segmentation formulate the problem using Conditional Random Fields. These models typically include a unary term and a pairwise term, whose parameters must be carefully chosen for optimal performance. Recently, structured learning approaches such as Structured SVMs SSVM have made it possible to jointly learn these model parameters. However, they have been limited to linear kernels, since more powerful non-linear kernels cause the learning to become prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we introduce an approach to "kernelize" the features so that a linear SSVM framework can leverage the power of non-linear kernels without incurring the high computational cost. We demonstrate the advantages of this approach in a series of image segmentation experiments on the MSRC data set as well as 2D and 3D datasets containing imagery of neural tissue acquired with electron microscopes.},

abstract = {Primary visual cortex (V1) in the mammalian brain computes on the fly perceptual primitives (form, motion, visual flow) from the feedforward bombardment of retinal events channeled through the thalamus. At the same time, it integrates the distributed feedback of higher cortical areas involved in more elaborate cognitive functions. The reverberating activity evoked by the interplay between these two streams has been hypothesized to form the trace of the low-level computational operations written on the "high resolution buffer" of primary cortical areas [1]. In vivo intracellular electrophysiology in V1 offers the unique possibility of listening to the synaptic echoes of the effective perceptual network at work. On the basis of the comparison between functional synaptic imaging and voltage sensitive dye imaging, I will show that the emergence of macroscopic features of perception (Gestalt and motion flow related percepts) in early sensory cortical areas can be predicted from the read-out of analog graded events (synaptic potentials) operating at a more microscopic integration level.},

abstract = {Object localization is an important step common to many different medical applications. In this Chapter, we will review the challenges and recent approaches tackling this problem, and focus on the work by Song et.al. [20]. In [20], a new graphical model with additional contrast and interest-region potentials is designed, encoding the higher-order contextual information between regions, on the global and structural levels. A discriminative sparse-coding based interest-region detector is also integrated as one of the context prior in the graphical model. This object localization method is generally applicable to different medical imaging applications, in which the objects can be distinguished from the background mainly based on feature differences. Successful applications on two different medical imaging applications --- lesion dissimilarity on thoracic PET-CT images and cell segmentation on microscopic images --- are demonstrated in the experimental results.},

abstract = {Cryo-electron Microscopy (cryoEM) is an important biophysical technique that produces 3-dimensional (3D) images at different resolutions. De novo modeling is becoming a promising approach to derive the atomic structure of proteins from the cryoEM 3D images at medium resolutions. Distance measurement along a thin skeleton in the 3D image is an important step in de novo modeling. In spite of the need of such measurement, little has been investigated about the accuracy of the measurement in searching for an effective method. We propose a new computational geometric approach to estimate the distance along the skeleton. Our preliminary test results show that the method was able to estimate fairly well in eleven cases.},

abstract = {Cardiac histo-anatomical structure is a key determinant in all aspects of cardiac function. While some characteristics of micro- and macrostructure can be quantified using non-invasive imaging methods, histology is still the modality that provides the best combination of resolution and identification of cellular/sub-cellular substrate identities. The main limitation of histology is that it does not provide inherently consistent three-dimensional 3D volume representations. This paper presents methods developed within our group to reconstruct 3D histological datasets. It includes the use of high-resolution MRI and block-face images to provide supporting volumetric datasets to guide spatial reintegration of 2D histological section data, and presents recent developments in sample preparation, data acquisition, and image processing.},

Based on the Microscopic working Mechanism of Molecular Motor (4M) in sacromere, this 4M model is established to reveal the relation between the characteristics of sEMG signal and active contraction force of muscle fiber. We discuss the interaction mechanism between human body and exoskeleton via analyzing the dynamics of exoskeleton robot and knee joint respectively. The knee joint torque that generated by skeletal muscle can be predicted accurately with the 4M model via measuring the sEMG signals on muscle surface. An active strategy for controlling exoskeleton robot has been proposed to train the lower limb on human intention. Experimental results show that the operator can exercise harmoniously with the exoskeleton, which prove the validity of this theoretical biomechanical model.},

abstract = {Automatically detecting and tracking the motion of Myxococcus xanthus bacteria provide essential information for studying bacterial cell motility mechanisms and collective behaviors. However, this problem is difficult due to the low contrast of microscopy images, cell clustering and colliding behaviors, etc. To overcome these difficulties, our approach starts with a level set based pre-segmentation of cell clusters, followed by an enhancement of the rod-like cell features and detection of individual bacterium within each cluster. A novel method based on "spikes" of the outer medial axis is applied to divide touching (colliding) cells. The tracking of cell motion is accomplished by a non-crossing bipartite graph matching scheme that matches not only individual cells but also the neighboring structures around each cell. Our approach was evaluated on image sequences of moving M. xanthus bacteria close to the edge of their swarms, achieving high accuracy on the test data sets.},

abstract = {A method for automatic analysis and interpretation of histopathology images is presented. The method uses a representation of the image data set based on bag of features histograms built from visual dictionary of Haar-based patches and a novel visual latent semantic strategy for characterizing the visual content of a set of images. One important contribution of the method is the provision of an interpretability layer, which is able to explain a particular classification by visually mapping the most important visual patterns associated with such classification. The method was evaluated on a challenging problem involving automated discrimination of medulloblastoma tumors based on image derived attributes from whole slide images as anaplastic or non-anaplastic. The data set comprised 10 labeled histopathological patient studies, 5 for anaplastic and 5 for non-anaplastic, where 750 square images cropped randomly from cancerous region from whole slide per study. The experimental results show that the new method is competitive in terms of classification accuracy achieving 0.87 in average.},

We further extract 22 features to describe the structural information and contextual information for each segment. These features are used to classify a gland segment into one of the three classes: artifact, normal gland and cancer gland. On a dataset of 48 images at 5\texttimes{} magnification (which includes 525 artifacts, 931 normal glands and 1,375 cancer glands), we achieved the following classification accuracies: 93% for artifacts v. true glands; 79% for normal v. cancer glands, and 77% for discriminating all three classes. The proposed method outperforms state of the art methods in terms of segmentation and classification accuracies and computational efficiency.},

The approach allows medical images containing intensity in homogeneities to be aligned and warped as part of a feature-based registration technique. Registration performance was evaluated on mono-modality and multi-modality data, namely magnetic resonance and histology images.

abstract = {In biology, recent techniques in confocal microscopy have produced experimental data which highlights the importance of cellular dynamics in the evolution of biological shapes. Thus, to understand the mechanisms underlying the morphogenesis of multi-cellular organisms, we study this cellular dynamic system in terms of its properties: cell multiplication, cell migration, and apoptosis. Besides, understanding the convergence of the system toward a stable form, involves local interactions between cells. Indeed, the way that cells self-organize through these interactions determines the resulting form. Along with the mechanisms of convergence highlighted above, the dynamic system also undergoes controls established by the nature on the organisms growth. Hence, to let the system viable, the global behavior of cells has to be assessed at every state of their developement and must satisfy the constraints. Otherwise, the whole system self-adapts in regard to its global behavior. Thus, we must be able to formalize in a proper metric space a metaphor of cell dynamics in order to find conditions (decisions, states) that would make cells to self-organize and in which cells self-adapt so as to always satisfy operational constraints (such as those induced by the tissue or the use of resources). Therefore, the main point remains to find conditions in which the system is viable and maintains its shape while renewing. The aim of this paper is to explain the mathematical foundations of this work and describe a simulation tool to study the morphogenesis of a virtual organism.},

In this work, we present an automated scheme for segmenting the phases namely Ferrite, Martensite and Bainite present in the microscopic image of HSLA steel. First of all, region contours are obtained using topological watershed. Each region is then characterized as Ferrite, Martensite and Bainite based on average intensity and white grain concentration of the region. Finally, a refinement process is carried out to merge the adjacent regions of same type. As no state of the art technique is readily available, the segmentation output has been validated by the domain expert.},

Furthermore, the incompliance to the treatment because of its high cost and related unfavorable effects makes its prediction of paramount importance. By using machine-learning techniques, a significantly accurate predictive model constructed to predict Egyptian patients' response based on their clinical and biochemical data. The model uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Trees (DT) to achieve this goal. Two-hundred patients treated with Peg-IFN and RBV, 83 responders (41%), and 117 non-responders (59%) retrospectively studied to extract informative features and train the Neural Networks and Decision Trees. Optimization was done by using six different Neural Network architectures, starting with an input layer of 12 neurons, a hidden layer of 70 to 180 neurons and an output layer containing a single neuron. For decision Trees (DTs), the CART classification algorithm was used. Six DTs with two classes, pruning levels of 9, 11, 13, and 17, and nodes from 45 to 61 were investigated. Among the 12 features in the study, the most statistically significant informative features were the patient's Histology activity index, fibrosis, viral-load, Alfa-feta protein and albumin. Validation of the models on a 20% test set was then performed. The best and average accuracy for the ANN and DT models were 0.76 and 0.69, and 0.80 and 0.72 respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 and 0.39, and 0.89 and 0.78 respectively. We conclude that decision trees gave a higher accuracy in predicting response, and would help in proper therapy options for patients.},

We deployed intermediate representations of images, generating segmentation masks corresponding to lumen and media-adventitia borders for both histology and IVUS images, incorporated into a non-rigid registration framework using discrete multi-labeling and approximate curvature penalty for smoothness regularization. The resulting deformation field was then applied to the original histology image to transfer it to IVUS coordinate system. Finally, the results were quantified on 14 cross sections of interest. The main contribution of this work is that the registered results could be used for systematic labeling of tissues, which ultimately will lead to reliable construction of training dataset for feature extraction and supervised classification of atherosclerotic tissues.},

The method uses a series of morphological operations to create a representation in which the objects of interest are easily isolated and counted. The proposal is successful in most cases, properly dealing with some difficult situations like when the sizes of the objects vary strongly and when there is low contrast between the objects and the background. Studies are underway in order to improve the performance of the method when dealing with strongly merged objects.},

abstract = {Cancer is the fourth leading cause of death among medically certified deaths in Malaysia. The most reliable diagnostic method to diagnose gastric adenocarcinoma is by inspecting the microscopic images of samples obtained through biopsy. These images are analyses by pathologist to identify the presence of cancer. However the process is time consuming and the interpretation varies with different pathologist. The application of image analysis techniques can assist pathologist towards a more efficient and faster diagnosis. Thus, this paper introduces an image analysis framework to automatically recognize and distinguished between normal gastric and gastric adenocarcinoma cells. The framework consist of the three phases of image analysis; preprocessing phase where the color tone issues are solved by component separation; processing phase which includes the thresholding and morphological techniques to segment the cells; post processing to identify the perimeter, area and roundness of the cells. This study shows that it is possible to automatically recognize and differentiate images with normal and abnormal cells.},

abstract = {As environmental sustainability issues have come to the societal and governmental forefront, a new breed of Green Information Systems (IS)---Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) Green IS---is emerging. A ULS Green IS is an open socio-technical ecosystem that differs from traditional IS in scale, complexity and urgency. Design issues found in ULS systems, System of Systems, Edge-dominant, Metropolis systems and Green IS converge and multiply in the ULS Green IS context. This paper presents a design framework and an architecture analysis method, ECO-ARCH, to address the design of such systems. Through an action research study on architecting for Demand Response systems in the Smart Grid, this article illuminates the system characteristics of ULS Green IS and endorses a fundamental shift in design thinking for its design -- from "bounded rationality" for problem solving to "expandable rationality" for design for the unknown and for innovation. ECO-ARCH advances existing software architecture analysis methods by complimenting expandable rationality design thinking with proven engineering techniques in a dual-level macroscopic-microscopic analysis. This tackles the unique architecting problems of ULS Green IS where many stakeholders are unknown and design goals are not provided, where no architecture pre-exists, where system behavior is non-deterministic and continuously evolving, and where co-creation with consumers and prosumers is essential to achieving triple bottom line goals.},

abstract = {To develop and evaluate potential of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as a topical carrier for enhanced skin permeation of tripterine. Tripterine-loaded NLCs were prepared by solvent diffusion method. The concentrations of lipophilic and hydrophilic surfactants were optimized based on the size and the entrapment efficiency (EE) of the resulting NLC. An amorphous state in the NLC matrix and a spherical morphology were observed in the optimized tripterine-loaded NLCs by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The average drug entrapment efficiency(EE), particle size and zeta potential of the tripterine-loaded NLCs were determined by ultra filtration and laser particle size analyzer, which were (88.64 0.57) %, (132.3 25) nm and (-26.5 3.4) mV, respectively. Drug release profile of tripterine-loaded NLCs in vitro was in accordance with Ritger and Peppas equation (ln R = 0.6571 ln t-2.9074, r = 0.9951) with a delayed release of tripterine. Moreover, compared with tripterine solution, the tripterine-loaded NLCs improved drug deposition in the skin of rat significantly. Considering the cellular up taking rate, the concentrations of tripterine after incubated with NLCs was 1.6-fold increased compared with tripterine solution. The results of penetration experiment and cellular uptake indicated that NLCs could enhence the drug deposition. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the NLCs system is a promising carrier for topical delivery of tripterine with improved drug deposition into skin.},

Under excitation of this excitation source, the photo luminance of the CdSe-QDs attached with listeria monocytogenes bacteria exhibit clear orange colour light. The image of the luminance was detected by a 1.3 Mpx sensitive web cam. This can be used in the biomedical analysis by using an optic microscope acting like an opto-biomedical microanalysis system (OBMAS). With use of the OBMAS one can qualitatively detect the presence of bacteria attached to the QDs through specific antibodies.},

The implanted sample surface showed a clear, smooth surface without any visual erosion features. The implanted Mylar fully restored their original color and the carbonization effect disappeared on the whole after AO exposure. The analysis through XPS indicates that a continuous high-quality protective oxide-based (Al2O3) surface layer was formed on the implanted polyimide films after the AO exposure.

The variety and quantity of corrosion products varied with the corrosive environment. The damage mechanisms of concrete also changed according to corrosive environment. For the simulated seawater environment, the effects of Mg2+ and SO42-were superimposed upon each other, thereby posing a serious threat to the structure, mainly in form of damage and coarsening of the pore structure caused by Mg2+.},

abstract = {Circuit Neuroscience tries to solve one of the most challenging questions in biology: How does the brain work? An important step towards an answer to this question is to gather detailed knowledge about the neuronal circuits of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Geometric representations of neuronal objects of the Drosophila are acquired using molecular genetic methods, confocal microscopy, non-rigid registration and segmentation. These objects are integrated into a constantly growing common atlas. The comparison of new segmented neurons to already known neurons is a frequent task which evolves with a growing amount of data into a bottleneck of the knowledge discovery process. Thus, the exploration of the atlas by means of domain specific similarity measures becomes a pressing need. To enable similarity based retrieval of neuronal objects we defined together with domain experts tailored dissimilarity measures for each of the three typical neuronal sub structures cell body, projection, arborization. The dissimilarity measure for composite neurons has been defined as domain specific combination of the sub structure dissimilarities. According to domain experts the developed system has big advantages for all tasks which involve extensive data exploration.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel image retrieval method for parasite detection based on the analysis of digital images captured by the camera from a microscope. In our approach we use several image processing methods to find known parasite shapes. At first, we use an edge detection method with edge representation by vectors. The next step consists in clustering edges fragments by their normal vectors and positions. Then grouped edges fragments are used to perform elliptical or circular shapes fitting as they resemble most parasite forms. This approach is invariant from rotation of parasites eggs or the analyzed sample. It is also invariant to scale of digital images and it is robust to overlapping shapes of parasites eggs thanks to the ability to reconstructing elliptical or other symmetric shapes that represent the eggs of parasites. With this solution we can also reconstruct incomplete shape of parasite egg which can be visible only in some part of the retrieved image.},

abstract = {Membrane receptors allow the cell to respond to changes in the composition of its external medium. The ligand-receptor interaction is the core of the signalling process and may be greatly influenced by the spatial configuration of receptors. As growing pieces of evidence suggest that receptors are not homogeneously spread on the cell surface, but tend to form clusters, we propose to investigate the implication of receptor clustering on ligand binding kinetics using a computational individual-based model. The model simulates the activation of receptors distributed in clusters or uniformly spread. The tracking of binding events allows the analysis of the effect of receptor clustering through the autocorrelation of the receptor activation signal and the empirical time distributions of binding events, which are still unreachable with in vitro or in vivo experiments. Results show that the apparent affinity of clustered receptors is decreased. Additionally, receptor occupation becomes spatially and temporally correlated, as clustering creates platforms of coherently activated receptors. Changes in the spatial characteristics of a signalling system at the microscopic scale globally affect its function in time and space.},

However, this limits the ability to explore interactions between multiple disparate transportation systems in a dynamic modeling environment. To address this gap, this study develops and tests a technique to federate two transportation models, each constructed using different simulation software packages: (1) a discrete event-based simulation model of a freight trucking terminal, and (2) a discrete time step-based traffic microscopic simulation model of the network serving the terminal. The federation technique is tested to determine if feedback loops are established dynamically between the models during simultaneous simulation runtime. The findings suggest that this federated simulation technique captures the dynamic interaction of the two systems being modeled. A comparison of the observed versus expected time-based characteristics of the interactions are shown to yield statistically significant correlation.},

The current work reports the applicability of mesoporous aluminosilica monoliths with three-dimensional structures and aluminum contents with 19 ≤ Si/Al ≥ 1 as effective adsorbents of aniline molecules from an aqueous solution. To better understanding the role of microscopic geometry and the nanoscale pore orientation of mesostructures, theoretical models have been developed. In addition, the atomic charge distribution in the interior structures was investigated to give insight about the effect of active site surfaces in the enhancement of the adsorption process. Our experimental results suggest that the acidity of the adsorbents significantly increased with increasing amounts of aluminum species in the pore framework walls. The natural surfaces of active acid sites of monoliths strongly induced the removal and adsorption of environmentally toxic aromatic amines from wastewater. The relative adsorption affinity of the mesocage adsorbent for organic pollutants was decreased in the order of p-nitroaniline &lt; o-aminophenol &lt; p-chloroaniline &lt; aniline. Generally, this adsorption model enables the development of simple and effective technique for the removal wastewater treatment.},

Seven factors, including driving years, number of lanes, radius of horizontal curve, longitudinal grade, road surface status, type of intersection and width of road surface, were selected as major influencing factors. The influencing factors were analyzed from a systematic perspective with the combination of human, vehicle and the road. A microscopic prediction model for traffic accidents based on quantitative theory has been established which developed from quantitative theory. To verify the model, the paper takes the data of road accident and actual structure from 222.888km to 377.387 km on national highway No.307. Furthermore, the road black-spot from 333.5km to 334.0km is selected to applied the model concretely, and some proposals are put forward to improve the present road conditions.},

publisher = {Winter Simulation Conference},
abstract = {Large-scale traffic and transportation logistics analysis requires a realistic depiction of network traffic condition in a dynamic manner. In the past decades, vehicular traffic simulation approaches have been increasingly developed and applied to describe time-varying traffic dynamics. Most of the existing approaches are so-called microscopic simulation in which complex driving behaviors such as car following and lane-changing are explicitly modeling in second or sub-second time resolution. These approaches are generally challenging to calibrate and validate and they demand a vast amount of computing resources. This paper discusses a new Anisotropic Mesoscopic Simulation (AMS) approach that carefully omits micro-scale details but nicely preserves critical traffic dynamics characteristics. The AMS model allows computational speed-ups in the order of magnitudes compared to the microscopic models, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. The underlying simulation rules and macroscopic dynamical characteristics are presented and discussed in this paper.},

However, biological variations, uneven staining and illumination, non-rigid deformations and touching or overlapping of the cell nuclei have made the detection procedure a major hurdle. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting and localizing cell nuclei based only on the cue of contour. The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates a pixel classifier using an over-complete set of contour features with different curvatures and orientations. We present results that are very competitive with other state-of-art cell nuclei detection scheme and show robustness to biological variations, different staining and illumination conditions, touching or partial occlusions. Our major contributions are the multicurvature cell nucleus contour model, and an efficient and effective strategy for sharing parameters between contour feature extractors of the same curvature but different orientations.},

These systems use combinations of image features that quantify a variety of image properties. Because researchers tend to validate their diagnostic systems on specific cancer endpoints, it is difficult to predict which image features will perform well given a new cancer endpoint. In this paper, we define a comprehensive set of common image features (consisting of 12 distinct feature subsets) that quantify a variety of image properties. We use a data-mining approach to determine which feature subsets and image properties emerge as part of an "optimal" diagnostic model when applied to specific cancer endpoints. Our goal is to assess the performance of such comprehensive image feature sets for application to a wide variety of diagnostic problems. We perform this study on 12 endpoints including 6 renal tumor subtype endpoints and 6 renal cancer grade endpoints.},

abstract = {We address the problem of automatic 3D segmentation of a stack of electron microscopy sections of brain tissue. Unlike previous efforts, where the reconstruction is usually done on a section-to-section basis, or by the agglomerative clustering of 2D segments, we leverage information from the entire volume to obtain a globally optimal 3D segmentation. To do this, we formulate the segmentation as the solution to a fusion problem. We first enumerate multiple possible 2D segmentations for each section in the stack, and a set of 3D links that may connect segments across consecutive sections. We then identify the fusion of segments and links that provide the most globally consistent segmentation of the stack. We show that this two-step approach of pre-enumeration and posterior fusion yields significant advantages and provides state-of-the-art reconstruction results. Finally, as part of this method, we also introduce a robust rotationally-invariant set of features that we use to learn and enumerate the above 2D segmentations. Our features outperform previous connectomic-specific descriptors without relying on a large set of heuristics or manually designed filter banks.},

The existing ad-hoc methods for correcting this problem generally work in RGB color model, and may result in both an unwanted color shift and loosing essential details in terms of the diagnosis. The aim of this study is to present an alternative method that remedies these deficiencies. We first identify the characteristics of uneven lighting in pathological images produced by using the H&amp;E technique, and then show how the quality of these images can be improved by applying an interpolation based approach in the Lab color model without losing any important detail. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on sample microscopic images.},

abstract = {Studies on social insects have demonstrated that complex, adaptive and self-organized behavior can arise at the macroscopic level from relatively simple rules at the microscopic level. Several past studies in robotics and artificial life have focused on the evolution and understanding of the rules that give rise to a specific macroscopic behavior such as task allocation, communication or synchronization. In this study, we demonstrate how colonies of embodied agents can be evolved to display multiple complex macroscopic behaviors at the same time. In our evolutionary model, we incorporate key features present in many natural systems, namely energy consumption, birth, death and a long evaluation time. We use a generic foraging scenario in which agents spend energy while they move and they must periodically recharge in the nest to avoid death. New robots are added (born) when the colony has foraged a sufficient number of preys. We perform an analysis of the evolved behaviors and demonstrate that several colonies display multiple complex and scalable macroscopic behaviors.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of histology sections into a 3-D volume receives increased attention due to its various applications in modern medical image analysis. To guarantee a geometrically coherent reconstruction, we propose a new way to register histological sections simultaneously to previously acquired reference images and to neighboring slices in the stack. To this end, we formulate two potential functions and associate them to the same Markov random field through which we can efficiently find an optimal solution. Due to our simultaneous formulation and the absence of any segmentation step during the reconstruction we can dramatically reduce error propagation effects. This is illustrated by experiments on carefully created synthetic as well as real data sets.},

Our method takes advantage of sparse scribble annotations provided by the user to guide a 3D variational segmentation model, thereby allowing our method to globally optimally enforce 3D geometric constraints on the segmentation. Moreover, we leverage a novel algorithm for propagating segmentation constraints through the image stack via optimal volumetric pathways, thereby allowing our method to compute highly accurate 3D segmentations from very sparse user input.We evaluate our method by reconstructing 16 neural processes in a 1024\texttimes{}1024\texttimes{}50 nanometer-scale EM image stack of a mouse hippocampus. We demonstrate that, on average, our method is 68% more accurate than previous state-of-the-art semi-automatic methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose to enhance the training data of boosting-based object detection frameworks by the use of principal component analysis (PCA). The quality of boosted classifiers highly depends on the image databases exploited in training. We observed that negative training images projected into the objects PCA space are often far away from the object class. This broad boundary between the object classes in training can yield to a high classification error of the boosted classifier in the testing phase. We show that transforming the negative training database close to the positive object class can increase the detection performance. In experiments on face detection and the analysis of microscopic cell images, our method decreases the amount of false positives while maintaining a high detection rate. We implemented our approach in a Viola &amp; Jones object detection framework using AdaBoost to combine Haar-like features. But as a preprocessing step our method can easily be integrated in all boosting-based frameworks without additional overhead.},

abstract = {In this paper a new approach aiming to detect and classify colon cancer cells is presented. Our detection approach was derived from the "Snake" method but using a progressive division of the dimensions of the image to achieve faster segmentation. Classification of different cell types was based on nine morphological parameters and on probabilistic neural network. Three types of cells were used to assess the efficiency of our segmentation and classifications models, including Benign Hyperplasia (BH), Intraepithelial Neoplasia (IN) that is a precursor state for cancer, and Carcinoma (Ca) that corresponds to abnormal tissue proliferation (cancer). Results showed that segmentation of microscopic images using this technique was of higher efficiency than the conventional snake method. The time consumed during segmentation was decreased to more than 50%. The efficiency of this method resides in its ability to segment Ca type cells that was difficult through other segmentation procedures. In classification only three morphologic parameters (area, Xor convex and solidity) were found to be effective to discriminate between the three types of cells. The results obtained using several images show the efficacy of the method.},

The performance is remarkable given a dermatological pathologist typically examines a plethora of features to make a diagnosis.

The inception of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) has motivated the researchers toward the quantitative analysis of such surface. Due to fracture, new surfaces are evolved and voids are also formed. Extraction of such regions (surface/void) from SEM fractographs is of immense importance as it enables the subsequent characterization of the surfaces and the study of void distribution. To carry out the analysis, image processing tools are being applied by the researchers mostly on a case to case basis. Thus, well founded image processing technique to cater the specific need is still lacking. In this work, we have proposed a scheme to determine the closed contour of the regions denoting the surface or void. The proposed methodology relies on the systematic combination of basic techniques of image processing to accomplish the task in an automated manner.},

abstract = {A non-asbestos semi-metallic stainless steel/carbon fiber reinforced PEEK-based friction material was developed and applied in Tunnel Boring Machine(TBM) driven clutch friction plate. The uniform design method of 5 factors and 27 levels was used to design and optimize the match composition. The friction plates were manufactured by dry-processing procedure, comprising mixing, pre-heating, cold pressing, adhesive coating, hot pressing and heat treatment. Friction and wear tests were carried out using a pin-on-disc type high temperature tribo-tester. The developed stainless/carbon fibers reinforced PEEK friction plates were used in Tunnel Boring Machine. The friction and wear mechanism was analyzed through observing the worn surface morphology by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The test results showed that the developed compound has better heat stability and wear resistance with slightly lower hardness and higher compress strength and impact toughness than asbestos composite, and these can decrease the wear of counter discs. The wear mechanism is mainly adhesive wear with lighter abrasive wear. The worn traces of developed friction plate were indistinct and damage degree of the counter plates was little, showing that the developed friction plate is suitable for TBM clutch Disc in hard working conditions of tunnel boring.},

This work has studied on the MPCF&amp;UV performance on small alga removal at the flow rate of 1~9m3/h. In the experiment, Chlorella Vulgaris, Nitzschia closterium, Platymonas subcordiformis were chosen as indicator organisms to mix with clean seawater as simulated ballast water. Microscope and SEM was used to analyze alga removal rates and to observe the changes in shape and structure of alga cells. The results show that higher removal percentages were obtained on all the three types of alga, and Platymonas subcordiformis was observed the highest removal rates of up to 100%. By SEM observation, it can be found that micro-pore ceramic filter (MPCF) can only ruin cell walls of the algae, and UV radiation can damage both cell walls and nucleus of the algae.},

The adsorption efficiency of SO2, NOx decreased with increasing of adsorption temperature, and particle size of biomass chars in the experimental range.

The sliding wear resistance of the silver base composite layers was investigated by a pin-on-disk wear tester. The performed investigations showed that the sliding wear of the silver coatings was significantly improved by introducing up to 10 vol. % diamond micro particles into the plating bath.While the co-deposition rate is strongly influenced by the plating parameters, a supplementary quantification of the co-deposited micro particles was done using an image processing software.

According to conventional methods indentations were observed by document examiners' eyes using a microscope. However it is difficult to estimate depths of the indentations because human eyes only can observe shades and brightness made by indentations instead of measuring the depths of indentations. Using a confocal laser microscope is able to directly measure the depths of indentations. However this method needs to take long time and instruments are expensive. Using a NIR LED and an optical model called shape from shading resolved the issues of time and cost. It is useful for forensic document examiners to approximately evaluate the depths of indentations of handwriting by our proposal method because the method will be lead to convenient discrimination between forgery handwriting and genuine one.},

Three new types of molecular probes have been developed and employed for such studies: 1) dual fluorophore-nitroxide compounds [2-11]. fluorescent-photochrome molecules [12-18], super molecules containing both fluorescent and fluorescent quenching segments [19]. The fluorescence properties of the new probes were intensively exploited for several practical applications including a real time analysis of antioxidants, nitric oxide, superoxide, reactive radicals, trinitrotoluene and metal ions in picomolar concentration scale, investigation of molecular dynamics (fluidity) of biomembranes in a wide range characteristic times from seconds to nanoseconds, and characterization of surface systems. Owning high sensitivity, simplicity, availability of fluorescence techniques, these methods can be widely employed using standard fluorescent techniques and are potentially adaptable to fibrooptic sensoring and focal microscopy.},

abstract = {Analyzing bone marrow is an important task for diagnosing diseases like certain types of leukemia and anemia. There are many different cell types in bone marrow. A certain ratio of these types is characteristic for a healthy human. Each deviation from that ratio is a significant indicator for diseases. Until now determining the ratio is done manually by an expert by counting and classifying the cells with a microscope. This is cumbersome and very time consuming. So there are efforts to automative the cell counting. The most difficult step to achieve that is the automatic segmentation of leukocytes in bone marrow smears. Because the segmentation quality of existing algorithms is not good enough a new algorithm was developed in the scope of this paper. This new algorithm is robust concerning variations as color fluctuations in the bone marrow images. The evaluation of this algorithm was done by comparing the segmentation results with the results obtained by an existing algorithm. Therefore a set of 27 bone marrow images was segmented and compared against a manual annotation. The segmentation quality obtained by the state of the art algorithm was 0.4544 and the quality achieved by the novel algorithm was 0.645 on a scale from zero to one, zero representing only invalid segmentations and one representing only perfect segmentations.},

abstract = {Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) imaging is the recommended laboratory technique to detect autoantibodies in patient serum, but it suffers from several issues limiting its reliability and reproducibility. IIF slides are observed by specialists at the fluorescence microscope, reporting fluorescence intensity and staining pattern and looking for mitotic cells. Indeed, the presence of such cells is a key factor to assess the correctness of slide preparation process and the reported staining pattern. Therefore, the ability to detect mitotic cells is needed to develop a complete computer-aided-diagnosis system in IIF, which can support the specialists from image acquisition up to image classification. Although recent research in IIF has been directed to image acquisition, image segmentation, fluorescence intensity classification and staining pattern recognition, no works presented methods suited to classify such cells. Hence, this paper presents an heterogeneous set of features used to describe the peculiarities of mitotic cells and then tests five classifiers, belonging to different classification paradigms. The approach has been evaluated on an annotated dataset of mitotic cells. The measured performances are promising, achieving a classification accuracy of 86.5 %.},

abstract = {Supervised classifiers require manually labeled training samples to classify unlabeled objects. Active Learning (AL) can be used to selectively label only "ambiguous" samples, ensuring that each labeled sample is maximally informative. This is invaluable in applications where manual labeling is expensive, as in medical images where annotation of specific pathologies or anatomical structures is usually only possible by an expert physician. Existing AL methods use a single definition of ambiguity, but there can be significant variation among individual methods. In this paper we present a consensus of ambiguity (CoA) approach to AL, where only samples which are consistently labeled as ambiguous across multiple AL schemes are selected for annotation. CoA-based AL uses fewer samples than Random Learning (RL) while exploiting the variance between individual AL schemes to efficiently label training sets for classifier training. We use a consensus ratio to determine the variance between AL methods, and the CoA approach is used to train classifiers for three different medical image datasets: 100 prostate histopathology images, 18 prostate DCE-MRI patient studies, and 9,000 breast histopathology regions of interest from 2 patients. We use a Probabilistic Boosting Tree (PBT) to classify each dataset as either cancer or non-cancer (prostate), or high or low grade cancer (breast). Trained is done using CoA-based AL, and is evaluated in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). CoA training yielded between 0.01-0.05% greater performance than RL for the same training set size; approximately 5-10 more samples were required for RL to match the performance of CoA, suggesting that CoA is a more efficient training strategy.},

address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {In this paper, we present a new dimensionality reduction (DR) method (SSGEAL) which integrates Graph Embedding (GE) with semi-supervised and active learning to provide a low dimensional data representation that allows for better class separation. Unsupervised DR methods such as Principal Component Analysis and GE have previously been applied to the classification of high dimensional biomedical datasets (e.g. DNA microarrays and digitized histopathology) in the reduced dimensional space. However, these methods do not incorporate class label information, often leading to embeddings with significant overlap between the data classes. Semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (SSDR) methods have recently been proposed which utilize both labeled and unlabeled instances for learning the optimal low dimensional embedding. However, in several problems involving biomedical data, obtaining class labels may be difficult and/or expensive. SSGEAL utilizes labels from instances, identified as "hard to classify" by a support vector machine based active learning algorithm, to drive an updated SSDR scheme while reducing labeling cost. Real world biomedical data from 7 gene expression studies and 3900 digitized images of prostate cancer needle biopsies were used to show the superior performance of SSGEAL compared to both GE and SSAGE (a recently popular SSDR method) in terms of both the Silhouette Index (SI) (SI = 0.35 for GE, SI = 0.31 for SSAGE, and SI = 0.50 for SSGEAL) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) for a Random Forest classifier (AUC = 0.85 for GE, AUC = 0.93 for SSAGE, AUC = 0.94 for SSGEAL).},

First, both macro- and microscopic features of traffic flow are reproduced quantitatively and compared with empirical findings. Then the model is used to simulate the vehicle emission of a moving fleet of vehicles. It is shown qualitatively that the emission rate is significantly increased in the medium density range with considering instantaneous velocity and acceleration together. Usually the total amount of pollutant discharge from vehicles is underestimated by considering average velocity alone. It is believed that a good driving strategy, e.g. eco-driving, is an effective way to reduce vehicle emission.},

abstract = {In this paper, an automated process to extract experiment-specific parameters out of microscope images of zebrafish embryos is presented and applied to experiments consisting of toxicological treated zebrafish embryos. The treatments consist of a dilution series of several compounds.A custom built graphical user interface allows an easy labeling and browsing of the image data. Subsequently image-specific features are extracted for each image based on image processing algorithms. By means of feature selection, the most significant features are determined and a classification divides the images in two classes. Out of the classification results dose-response curves as well as frequently used general indicators of substance's acute toxicity can be automatically calculated. Exemplary the median lethal dose is determined. The presented approach was designed for real high-throughput screening including data handling and the results are stored in a long-time data storage and prepared to be processed on a cluster computing system being build up in the KIT. It provides the possibility to test any amount of chemical substances in highthroughput and is, in combination with new screening microscopes, able to manage ten thousands of risk tests required e.g. in the REACH framework or for drug discovery.},

abstract = {Image focus quality is of utmost importance in digital microscopes because the pathologist cannot accurately characterize the tissue state without focused images. We propose to train a classifier to measure the focus quality of microscopy scans based on an extensive set of image features. However, classifiers rely heavily on the quality and quantity of the training data, and collecting annotated data is tedious and expensive. We therefore propose a new method to automatically generate large amounts of training data using image stacks. Our experiments demonstrate that a classifier trained with the image stacks performs comparably with one trained with manually annotated data. The classifier is able to accurately detect out-of-focus regions, provide focus quality feedback to the user, and identify potential problems of the microscopy design.},

abstract = {The monitoring of the dynamics of stem cells' growth in culture is important in regenerative medicine. In this paper the method of cells' images segmentation based on alternating microscopic imaging with bright field (BF) and epifluorescent (EF) images is proposed. The method consists of two principal stages: coarse segmentation of EF images followed by fine segmentation on BF ones. The latter is based on the morphological watershed from markers produced in the first stage. Due to the fact that sequence of EF is shorter than BF one, markers cannot be produced directly for all BF images. In order to create them, an additional step of morphological interpolation of markers is applied.},

abstract = {A method was described for the acute isolation of neurons suitable for patch-clamping study from the frontal cortex of 7-10-d-old Kunming mice by a combination of mechanical and enzymatic means. Using inverted microscope and whole-cell configuration of patch-clamp technique, the morphological and electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons were studied respectively. It was shown that the enzymatically isolated neurons had plump profile, smooth surface, strong aureole and long survival time, met the electrophysiological requirements, and exhibited the whole-cell transmembrane currents, voltage-gated sodium and potassium currents. The experiment proves that this method is simple, efficient, reliable and utility. The dissociated cortical neurons could be obtained and applied to patch-clamping study, which has reference value for studying the effects of physiology, pathology, pharmacology and physical factors on the ion channels of the cortical neurons of mice.},

abstract = {The morphology and structure of 3D dendritic backbones are the essential to understand the neuronal circuitry and behaviors in the neurodegenerative diseases. As a big challenge, the research of extraction of dendritic backbones using image processing and analysis technology has attracted many computational scientists. This paper proposes a reliable and robust approach for automatically extract dendritic backbones in 3D optical microscopy images. Our systematic scheme is a gradient vector field based skeletonization approach. We first use self-snake based nonlinear diffusion, adaptive segmentation to smooth noise and segment the neuron object. Then we propose a hierarchical skeleton points detection algorithm (HSPD) using the measurement criteria of low divergence and high iso-surface principle curvature. We further create a minimum spanning tree to represent and establish effective connections among skeleton points and prune small and spurious branches. To improve the robustness and reliability, the dendrite backbones are refined by B-Spline kernel based data fitting. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate that our approach has high reliability, good robustness and requires less user interaction.},

In this work, an image processing tool, called PyFibers, was developed, based on mathematical morphology (MM) operations. The tool extracts the contours from the images with minimal user intervention, and outputs a text file containing the contours coordinates and a DXF file with the contours. Either of these files can, subsequently, be used as input to softwares that evaluate the optical properties of the fibers.},

Then, a post-processing stage eliminates regions, whose shape is not similar to the nuclei searched.

The anisotropic contour completion (ACC) employed is equivalent to a dilation with a continuous elliptic structural element that takes into account the local orientation of the contours to be closed, preventing extension towards the normal direction. Experiments carried out on real images from an optical microscope revealed a remarkable reliability with up to 86% of cells in the field of view correctly segmented and targeted for microinjection.},

A novel technique, based on confocal microscopy, can now provide new images of the respiratory alveolar system, for which quantitative analysis tools must be developed, for diagnosis and follow up of pathological situations. In particular, we wish to aid the clinician by developing a computer-aided diagnosis system, able to discriminate between healthy and pathological subjects. This paper describes this system, in which images are first characterized through a 148-feature vector then classified by an SVM (Support Vector Machine). Experiments conducted on smoker and non smoker images show that the dimensionality of the feature vector can be reduced significantly without decreasing classification accuracy, and thus gaining some insight about the usefulness of features for medical diagnosis. These promising results allow us to consider interesting perspectives for this very challenging medical application.},

In the present work tensile and hardness behaviors of CuZn40Al1 alloys produced by continuous casting and extrusion were investigated. Microstructural features and fracture surfaces were studied by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that wrought samples exhibited higher mechanical properties than those of continuous cast samples. A systematic and meaningful relationship was observed between microstructural features and mechanical properties such as hardness, yield stress and ultimate tensile strength. Fractography investigations showed that fracture occurred in stop-start region in continuous cast materials.},

We conclude that technologies linked to non-human scales are neglected, that convergence is insufficient to guide ubiquity, that environmental factors endanger resulting ecosystems, and that these ecosystems lack critical organisms, links and mechanisms. We accordingly suggest thirteen foundations for viable and healthy ecosystems based on ubicomp. They involve guiding concepts, ubiquitous virtual reality, sustainability, climatic factors, resource optimization and management, waste processors, open standards, features (anonymity, redundancy, simplicity), and mechanisms (provision, regulation, support) to structure and maintain ecosystem services useful to humans.},

Scanning electron microscope (SEM; LEO 1530) was used to examine the microstructures and morphology of the films. The results showed that the morphology of Au nano-particles/island films were different with the increasing sputtering time. Au particles experienced a dramatic change on the Si wafer surface, when sputtering time changed from 5sec. to 60 sec. In order to decrease the surface free energy, Au particles diffused and agglomerated with the increasing annealing temperature. With the sputtering time increasing, the size of Au nano-particles changed large. With the annealing temperature increasing, the Au atoms diffused and agglomerated. Au nano-particles changed island films or unregular strips.},

However, cells are difficult to segment due to bad image quality in the in vivo images. We describe an approach to automatically search for cell division in the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem using image registration and optical flow. This approach is based on the difference of speeds of the cell division and growth processes (cell division being a much faster process).With this approach, we can achieve a detection accuracy of 96.4%.},

abstract = {Biomedical images are intrinsically complex with each domain and modality often requiring specialized knowledge to accurately render diagnosis and plan treatment. A general software framework that provides access to high-performance resources can make possible high-throughput investigations of micro-scale features as well as algorithm design, development and evaluation. In this paper we describe the requirements and challenges of supporting microscopy analyses of large datasets of high-resolution biomedical images. We present high-performance computing approaches for storage and retrieval of image data, image processing, and management of analysis results for additional explorations. Lastly, we describe issues surrounding the use of high performance computing for scaling image analysis workflows.},

abstract = {Computer-aided prognosis (CAP) is a new and exciting complement to the field of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and involves developing computerized image analysis and multi-modal data fusion algorithms for helping physicians predict disease outcome and patient survival. At the Laboratory for Computational Imaging and Bioinformatics (LCIB)1 at Rutgers University we have been developing computerized algorithms for high dimensional data and image analysis for predicting disease outcome from multiple modalities including MRI, digital pathology, and protein expression. Additionally, we have been developing novel data fusion algorithms based on nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods (such as Graph Embedding) to quantitatively integrate prognostic information from multiple data sources and modalities. In this paper, we briefly describe 5 representative and ongoing CAP projects at LCIB. These projects include (1) an Image-based Risk Score (IbRiS) algorithm for predicting outcome of ER+ breast cancer patients based on quantitative image analysis of digitized breast cancer biopsy specimens alone, (2) segmenting and determining extent of lymphocytic infiltration (identified as a possible prognostic marker for outcome in Her2+ breast cancers) from digitized histopathology, (3) segmenting and diagnosing highly agressive triple-negative breast cancers on dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, (4) distinguishing patients with different Gleason grades of prostate cancer (grade being known to be correlated to outcome) from digitzed needle biopsy specimens, and (5) integrating protein expression measurements obtained from mass spectrometry with quantitative image features derived from digitized histopathology for distinguishing between prostate cancer patients at low and high risk of disease recurrence.},

abstract = {A single digital pathology image can occupy over 10 gigabytes of hard disk space, rendering it difficult to store, analyze, and transmit. Though image compression provides a means of reducing the storage requirement, its effects on CAD (and pathologist) performance are not yet clear. In this work we assess the impact of compression on the ability of a CAD system to detect carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) in histological sections. The CAD algorithm proceeds as follows: Glands in the tissue are segmented using a region-growing algorithm. The size of each gland is then extracted and modeled using a mixture of Gamma distributions. A Markov prior (specifically, a probabilistic pairwise Markov model) is employed to encourage nearby glands to share the same class (i.e. cancerous or non-cancerous). Finally, cancerous glands are aggregated into continuous regions using a distance-hull algorithm. We evaluate CAD performance over 12 images compressed at 14 different compression ratios using JPEG2000. Algorithm performance (measured using the under the receiver operating characteristic curves) remains relatively constant for compression ratios up to 1:256. After this point performance degrades precipitously. We also have an expert pathologist view the compressed images and assign a confidence measure as to their diagnostic fidelity.},

abstract = {Although thalamic nuclei are not directly visible on conventional anatomical magnetic resonance images (MRI), it is possible to observe differences between the nuclei using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), because of their distinct fiber orientation. This work presents a method to segment the various nuclei of human thalamus using diffusion MRI. Our approach is to use the watershed transform and other concepts from mathematical morphology to segment the nuclei. However, to segment structures using the tensor data produced with DTI (as opposed to scalar images) the concept of a tensorial morphological gradient (TMG) needs to be introduced. Based on the TMG, segmentation of the nuclei of the thalamus was successful using the watershed transform. Our segmentation is consistent with a histological atlas. Since the proposed method, as opposed to the majority ofthe DTI-based segmentation methods, does not require manual seed and/or surface placement, its results are highly repeatable.},

Then, we apply a learned hidden conditional random field classifier to classifY each candidate sequence as mitosis or not. The proposed detection method achieved 95% precision and 85% recall in very challenging image sequences of multipolar-shaped C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells. The superiority of the method was further demonstrated by comparisons with conditional random field and support vector machine classifiers.

abstract = {The knowledge of the structure and morphology of neurons is a central part of our understanding of the brain. There have been concerted efforts in recent years to develop libraries of neuronal structures that can be used for multiple purposes including modeling the brain connectivity and understanding how cellular structure regulates function. However, at present, tracing neuronal structures from microscopy images of neurons is very time consuming and somewhat subjective and therefore not practical for the current datasets. Current automatic state of the art algorithms for neuron tracing fail to work in neuron images which have low contrast, amorphous filament boundaries, branches, and clutter. In this paper, we develop Tree2Tree, a robust automatic neuron segmentation and morphology generation algorithm. It uses a local medial tree generation strategy for visible parts of the neuron and then uses a global tree linking approach to build a maximum likelihood global tree by combining the local trees. Tests on cluttered confocal microscopy images of Drosophila neurons give results that correspond to ground truth within ±5.3 pixel RMSE margin of error.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {We present a novel methodological framework for leveraging multiple image sources, including different modalities, acquisition protocols or image features, in the registration of more than two images via information theoretic data fusion. The technique, referred to as multi-attribute combined mutual information (MACMI), adopts a multivariate application of mutual information (MI) to allow several coregistered images to be represented as a single high dimensional multi-attribute image. Our approach improves scenarios involving registration of multiple images as it, (1) utilizes all aligned images obtained in earlier registration steps, (2) improves alignment accuracy compared with pairwise approaches that only consider two images (and hence a fraction of the available data) at a time, and (3) avoids complex optimization problems often associated with fullygroupwise methods. For example, if two coregistered volumes such as T2-weighted and PD-weighted MRI are to be aligned with PET, it is intuitively better to use information from both MR protocols instead of choosing one for registration with PET. In the automated elastic registration of 20 corresponding multiprotocol (T1, T2, PD) synthetic MRI images of the brain with known misalignment of PD MRI, MACMI showed significant improvement in terms of deformation field error over conventional MI-based pairwise registration (p &lt; 0.05). For a total of 108 corresponding whole-mount histology (WMH), T2 MRI, and DCE (T1) MRI images obtained from 17 prostate specimens with cancer, elastic registration of WMH to both MRI protocols simultaneously was performed via MACMI. Improved alignment in terms of prostate overlap and cancer localization was observed using MACMI, compared to pairwise registration of WMH to the individual T2 and DCE MR protocols.},

The proposed method exploits the output pattern of a ring filter bank applied to the input image, which consists of a series of matched filters with multiple-radius ring-shaped templates. By modeling the profile of each filter response as a quadratic surface, we explore the variations of peak curvatures and peak values of the filter responses when the ring radius varies.

abstract = {In confocal microscopy imaging, the target objects are labeled with fluorescent markers in the living specimen, and usually appear as spots in the observed images. Spot detection and analysis is an important task for the biological studies from the observed images. However, while the spots have irregular sizes and positions due to the variant amount of objects on each spot, the quantitative interpretation of the labeled objects is still heavily reliant on manual evaluation. In this paper, a novel shape modeling algorithm is proposed for automating the detection and analysis of the spots of interest. The algorithm exploits a Gaussian mixture model to characterize the spatial intensity distribution of the spots, and optimizes the model parameters using split-and-merge expectation maximization (SMEM) algorithm. As a result, a large amount of target objects with uncertain shapes can be analyzed in a systematic way.},

The superiority of the proposed model is shown by comparing it with existing ones considering several thought experiments. Moreover, we apply an evolutionary algorithm to solve the model calibration problem, considering two real-world instances. The objective function for this problem comes from a set of highly nonlinear coupled differential equations. An interesting feature that came out is that the solutions are multi-modal.

abstract = {The ability to accurately classify cancer patients into risk classes, i.e. to predict the outcome of the pathology on an individual basis, is a key ingredient in making therapeutic decisions. In recent years gene expression data have been successfully used to complement the clinical and histological criteria traditionally used in such prediction. Many “gene expression signatures” have been developed, i.e. sets of genes whose expression values in a tumor can be used to predict the outcome of the pathology. Here we investigate the use of several machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer patients using one of such signatures, the well established 70-gene signature. We show that Genetic Programming performs significantly better than Support Vector Machines, Multilayered Perceptron and Random Forest in classifying patients from the NKI breast cancer dataset, and slightly better than the scoring-based method originally proposed by the authors of the seventy-gene signature. Furthermore, Genetic Programming is able to perform an automatic feature selection. Since the performance of Genetic Programming is likely to be improvable compared to the out-of-the-box approach used here, and given the biological insight potentially provided by the Genetic Programming solutions, we conclude that Genetic Programming methods are worth further investigation as a tool for cancer patient classification based on gene expression data.},

abstract = {During the last years, skin aging has become an area of increasing research interest. High frequency ultrasound allows the “in vivo” appreciation of certain histological parameters and offers new characteristic markers, which may quantify the severity of the cutaneous senescence process. This paper focuses on measuring the changes in skin thickness and dermis echogenicity , as part of the complex ageing process, on different intervals of age. In particular by using a multiscale approach we will compute some parameters which are connected with complexity (fractal structure) of skin ageing.},

abstract = {We present a new interaction handling model for physics-based sound synthesis in virtual environments. A new three-level surface representation for describing object shapes, visible surface bumpiness, and microscopic roughness (e.g. friction) is proposed to model surface contacts at varying resolutions for automatically simulating rich, complex contact sounds. This new model can capture various types of surface interaction, including sliding, rolling, and impact with a combination of three levels of spatial resolutions. We demonstrate our method by synthesizing complex, varying sounds in several interactive scenarios and a game-like virtual environment. The three-level interaction model for sound synthesis enhances the perceived coherence between audio and visual cues in virtual reality applications.},

abstract = {For most of optical microscopes, the fact that a point light source is adopted results in the nonuniform distribution of illuminance. As a result, for the ferrography image gained using optical microscopy, the image pixels are brighter in the centre than in the edge. Undoubtedly, this will influence significantly the precision of binary image segmentation which is a key step to gain the characterization of wear debris. Therefore, it is very imperative to eliminate the nonuniform distribution of the background brightness of the ferrography image before performing an effective and accurate binary image segmentation. This project is to investigate the elimination of the nonuniform distribution of the background brightness of the ferrographic images in order to gain the accurate binary image of the ferrographic image. Different methods based on the first-order gradient operators, the second-order gradient operators and compensation of the nonuniform distribution of the illumination are developed and their comparison are also presented in the paper. It is believed that the knowledge presented in this paper will be helpful to get the accurate binary image of the ferrographic image which is the foundation of analyzing morphology of wear debris.},

Furthermore, there were a lot of pinholes and punctate foreign matters. The result from energy spectrum analysis showed that the oxygen content of foreign matters in cracks was remarkably higher than that of non-crack area. Combining the observation and analysis of polarizing microscope, it was concluded that the foreign matters are the mixture of FeO, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3, and the reason of cracks resulted form the foreign matters of ferriferous oxides formed the forging pucker during the forging process. After the mould cavity of the forging die had been improved, the cracks of the rollers disappeared.},

The results show that there existed block ferrite and non-solution granular carbides in metallographic structure for 3Cr17NiMo quenched at high temperature. It is one of main reasons resulting in poor polishing performance for 3Cr17NiMo plastic die steel. Previous analysis is agreed with predicted result using Thermo-Calc software. In order to improve polishing performance for 3Cr17NiMo, Thermo-Calc software was applied to thermodynamic. Simulated results show that the polishing performance can be improved by modifying the chemical constitution of 3Cr17NiMo by reducing the content of C and Cr, and adding N properly.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Auto focusing has been implemented in many applications for decades. However, challenges still exist in design of high speed and reliability of a focusing algorithm under a variety of microscopic views. The clarity of images measured by a method is generally varying in hill-shaped manner with respect to lens positions at a focus region, but the signal-to-noise ratio of the measure is low at a far-off focused. This will limit the working range of focusing. This paper proposes a new method by integrating multiple measures for near and far-off focused. Monotonous variation of individual measures is integrated and used for expanding the working range of focusing control with adaptation of step size. Views for focusing under x50 microscopic lens using the proposed method are illustrated in this study. The working range is expanded to be 50 times of depth of field from focused. Feasibility of the proposed method is investigated on a practical PC-based system. Two case studies are provided to demonstrate the feasibility.},

abstract = {One of the major limitations in the development of ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensors based on one-dimensional nanostructure is the difficulty involved with reliably fabricating nanoelectrode arrays (NEAs). In previous work, a simple, robust and scalable wafer-scale fabrication method to produce multiplexed biosensors is introduced. Each sensor chip consists of nine individually addressable arrays that uses electron beam patterned vertically aligned carbon nanofibers (VACNFs) as the sensing element. To ensure nanoelectrode behavior with higher sensitivity, VACNFs were precisely grown on 100 nm Ni dots with 1µm spacing on each micro pad. However, in order to examine the quality and measure the height and diameter of the VACNFs, some surface detection and measurement tool at the nanoscale level is needed. In this paper, we introduce an approach to measure these nano-scale features through Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). With this method, both the 2D and 3D images of sample surface are generated and the sizes of carbon nanofibers and cavities are obtained. Furthermore, statistical analysis is carried out to enable improvement of VACNFs growth and fabrication.},

However, in the microscopic based traffic model, it is revealed that in high frequency sampled test, the variables such as flow, density, and lane usage have common trend of U shape in daytime, e.g. high in peak time and low in off-peak time. Based on the traffic database of cross-river channel in LuJiaZui, PuDong, Shanghai, the statistics method is used for different sampling frequency to validate the mean, standard variance, and kurtosis. The variant ratio is used to analyze the first order negative correlation among high frequency sampled traffic data. The result shows the models (e.g. ARMA model) used in low frequency sampling data cannot directly apply to high frequency samples. In order to validate the U shape distribution of traffic data in daytime, the wavelet based nerve network is used for the analysis of ‘calendar phenomena’ of cross-river tunnel traffic.},

isbn = {9781424456536},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Recent investigations in estimating object shape in images and leveraging knowledge of expected shapes to perform object segmentation have necessitated the formalization of a rigorous mathematical theory of shape. Most of the existing theory in nonlinear shape manifolds lacks physically meaningful parameterization of the shape components, for e.g., pose. We build a novel pose-shape manifold in which manifold parameters signify physically meaningful pose/shape deformation modes. Geodesic distances on this manifold estimate dissimilarities in pose and shape. The segmentation method initializes a template point on the pose-shape manifold and navigates the manifold to converge on the correct pose and shape of the object to be segmented. We show that this method is superior to traditional active contour methods in robustness to edges from clutter. Application of this method to cell delineation of vascular myocytes from phase-contrast microscopy gives reliable segmentation (within ±5% RMS pixel error) of cell boundaries and reliable estimates of geodesic object deformation.},

abstract = {This paper presents an automatic system for morphological screening of the bladder cells. This system is intended to increase efficiency of the subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization examination by limiting the number of suspicious cells. The system works in two major phases. The first phase is slide scanning. The second stage includes cells detection and morphological analysis. Both stages refine their results using supervised classification algorithm. The developed method was tested on nine microscopical slides, containing more than 12000 manually labeled cells. The results provided by the system were compared to the ground truth labeled by a human expert.},

In this paper, we take a microscopic view of the information propagation pattern in blogosphere by investigating blog cascade affinity. A blog cascade is a group of posts linked together discussing about the same topic, and cascade affnity refers to the phenomenon of a blog's inclination to join a specific cascade. We identify and analyze an array of features that may affect a blogger's cascade joining behavior and utilize these features to predict cascade affinity of blogs. Evaluated on a real dataset consisting of 873,496 posts, our svm-based prediction achieved accuracy of 0.723 measured by F1. Our experiments also showed that among all features identified, the number of friends was the most important factor affecting bloggers' inclination to join cascades.},

abstract = {A critical part in our knowledge of the brain is the understanding of the structure and morphology of neurons. In recent years, we have witnessed a tremendous effort in developing libraries of neuronal structures that can be used for multiple purposes. These critical studies include modeling the brain connectivity and understanding how cellular structure regulates brain function. Presently, methods for tracing neuronal structures from microscopy images of neurons are not only tedious, but prone to user bias; hence they are not suitable for practical purposes. State of the art automatic neuron tracing algorithms fail to give satisfactory results for neuron images with low contrast, discontinuous filaments, and complex branching. In this paper, we develop Tree2Tree, an automatic neuron segmentation and morphology generation algorithm. Our algorithm uses a global tree linking strategy to connect smaller medial trees of visible components of the neuron in order to give an optimal explanation of the brightness patterns of the neuron branches. We intend to utilize these graph-based segmentation results in the retrieval of similar neurons from an extensive database of segmented neurons. We have tested our algorithm on confocal microscopy images of Drosophila neurons and our segmentation results are congruent with (within ± 5.3 pixel RMSE) the manually obtained ground truth.},

Then, the fuel consumption and emission characteristics were analyzed at microscopic, mesoscopic as well as macroscopic levels. The analysis results on driving behaviors showed that the driving time was mainly distributed in low and middle-speed bins, the driving distance was mainly located in middle-speed bins, and the driving time and distance under cruise mode accounted for the highest proportion. The analysis results on fuel consumption and emission characteristics showed that the average level of fuel consumption was 18.6 L/100km, the average emission factors of NOx and PM were 4.63 g/km and 0.087 g/km for HDDVs, which met Euro III standard. At the microscopic level, driving at high-speed and acceleration is associated with the instantaneous high fuel consumption and emission rates. At the mesoscopic level, idling or driving at low-speed was the main reason of high fuel consumption and emission factors. At the macroscopic level, driving distance was a significant influencing factor for total fuel consumption and emissions calculation.},

abstract = {The regular methods for nickel removal such as activated carbon adsorption are always complicated in process and expensive in construction and maintenance. In this research coal fly ash, usually taken as industrial waste, was synthesized into particle filter material, and then the latter was used as absorbent for nickel removal from aqueous water. The physical and chemical properties of this material were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Results indicated that this material had high porosity and large surface area. The main elements of this material were oxygen, silicon, carbon, aluminum, iron, calcium and magnesium. In the batch experiments for the application of this filter material in nickel removal, the effects of contact time, pH and temperature were studied. The batch experiments showed an equilibrium time of 90 min was required for effective adsorption of nickel. Removal ratio of nickel increased greatly at pH 5.5-6.5. More than 90% of nickel was removed with solution pH above 6.5. Adsorption rate constant (k) increased as temperature (T) rose. The equation describing the relation of k and T complied to Arrhenius equation, which indicated the adsorption of nickel on this filter material had some characteristics of chemical reaction. The adsorption isotherm of nickel accorded with Langmuir model.},

abstract = {One of the major limitations in the development of ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensors based on onedimensional nanostructure is the difficulty involved with reliably fabricating nanoelectrode arrays (NEAs). In previous work, a simple, robust and scalable wafer-scale fabrication method to produce multiplexed biosensors is introduced. Each sensor chip consists of nine individually addressable arrays that uses electron beam patterned vertically aligned carbon nanofibers (VACNFs) as the sensing element. To ensure nanoelectrode behavior with higher sensitivity, VACNFs were precisely grown on 100 nm Ni dots with 1µm spacing on each micro pad. However, in order to examine the quality and measure the height and diameter of the VACNFs, some surface detection and measurement tool at the nanoscale level is needed. In this paper, we introduce an approach to measure these nano-scale features through Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). With this method, both the 2D and 3D images of sample surface are generated and the sizes of carbon nanofibers and cavities are obtained. Furthermore, statistical analysis is carried out to enable improvement of VACNFs growth and fabrication.},

The arbitrary shape objects are made of the photo-crosslinkable resin on the microchip under a microscope. The polymerized micro-objects, which we call as "Microtools", can be used for the single cell analysis. The microtools are fabricated at the desired place on the microchip in less than 1 second. Additionally, the microtools are manipulated by optical tweezers. By high-speed scanning of a single laser with galvanometer mirror, it is able to manipulate multiple points simultaneously. Using this technique, the rotational microstructure composed of the rotation axis and the microgear is assembled and rotated. We propose the two method of microstructure assembly. The assembled rotational microstructure is evaluated about the rotation speed depending on the laser power.},

Previous feature based registration algorithms often use truncated search strategies in order to achieve small computation times. Our new accelerated search strategy is based on the realization that the search for corresponding features can be dramatically accelerated by utilizing Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimension reduction. Order of magnitude calculations for the search strategy we propose here indicate that the algorithm proposed is more than a million times faster than previously utilized naive search strategies, and this advantage in speed is directly translated into an advantage in accuracy as the fast speed enables more comparisons to be made in the same amount of time. We describe the accelerated scheme together with a full complexity analysis. The registration algorithm was applied to large transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of neural ultrastructure. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm enables alignment of TEM images with increased accuracy and efficiency compared to previous algorithms.},

Stable cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged protein GFP-PCNA produce rich, dynamically varying sub-cellular foci patterns characterizing the cell cycle phases, including the progress during the S-phase. Variable fluorescence patterns, drastic changes in SNR, shape and position changes and abundance of touching cells require sophisticated algorithms for reliable automatic segmentation and cell cycle classification. We extend the recently proposed graph partitioning active contours (GPAC) for fluorescence-based nucleus segmentation using regional density functions and dramatically improve its efficiency, making it scalable for high content microscopy imaging. We utilize surface shape properties of GFP-PCNA intensity field to obtain descriptors of foci patterns and perform automated cell cycle phase classification, and give quantitative performance by comparing our results to manually labeled data.},

Starting from any suitable crisp segmentation, we extract a one-pixel thin 4-connected boundary between the observed image components where a local linear mixture model is used for estimating fractional pixel coverage values. We evaluate the presented segmentation method, as well as its usefulness for subsequent precise feature estimation, on synthetic test objects with increasing levels of noise added. We conclude that for reasonable noise levels the presented method outperforms the achievable results of a perfect crisp segmentation. Finally, we illustrate the application of the suggested method on a real histological colour image.},

In order to overcome this problem, we propose a technology of histopathological diagnostic support that uses higher-order local autocorrelation (HLAC) features. The proposed method can automatically screen tissue that is believed to be normal tissue to detect cancerous tissue as well as tissue that is suspected of being cancerous to detect abnormalities.

Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the micro-morphology and structure of oxide scales formed on nickel substrate. It was found that Y-implantation greatly improved the anti-oxidation ability of nickel both in isothermal and cyclic oxidizing experiments. Acoustic emission (AE) technique was used in situ to monitor the cracking and spalling of oxide films in isothermal oxidizing stage and air-cooling stage, and to examine the number and size distribution of oxide/substrate interfacial defects. Laser Raman microscopy was also used to study the stress status of oxide scales formed on nickel with and without yttrium. The main reason for the improvement in anti-oxidation of nickel was that Y-implantation greatly reduced the growing speed and grain size of NiO. This fine-grained NiO oxide film might have better high temperature plasticity and could relieve parts of compressive stress by means of creeping, and maintained ridge character and relatively lower internal stress level. In the meantime, Y-implantation reduced the size and number of interfacial defects, hence remarkably enhanced the adhesion of protective NiO oxide scale formed on nickel substrate.},

abstract = {Normalized Cross Correlation Operating (NCCO) between two binary images, template image and target image, is independent of their gray levels. Further more, providing the template is a binary image, the calculation results of NCCO should remain unrelated to the gray level of the template image. This paper proved the inference above and presented some methods to improve the pattern matching algorithms. These methods can be applied to the microscopic vision field, where the majority of images are low in their gray levels, approximating to three-value images, or even binary. Experimental results show that the characteristics of gray level unrelated to the NCCO can give guidance to designing template images, reducing time consumption of calculations, as well as improving positioning algorithm.},

abstract = {Chitosan-Hydroxyapatite (Cs-Hap) composites were prepared through a biomimetic method by Hap precipitation from its precursors, CaCl2 and NaH2PO4, on the chitosan fibres. Materials composition and structure have been analyzed by usual analytical techniques, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FT-IR and SEM data have shown the formation of Hap onto Cs fibers and Cs acting as glue, bonding the Hap crystals. The Cs-Hap composites porosity, from SEM data analysis, increases by increasing the content of Hap. The biodegradation of materials was tested in buffered lysozyme solution and the degraded polysaccharide was measured; the SEM data, before and after degradation, revealed that composites morphology had not appreciable changed.‘In vitro’ degradation studies indicate that these composite have slighter degradation rate which is coupled to the degree of N-deacetylation, hydrophilicity and crystallinity. Swelling properties measurements in simulated body fluids have shown that the swelling ratio of composites is decreased when the content of Hap is higher. The obtained results revealed that obtained Cs-Hap composites are promising materials as bone substitute due to their adequate swelling properties and controlled degradation rate.},

These methods are built upon an underlying Maximum a Posteriori estimation of Markov Random Fields and are suitable to solve accurately many different problems in image analysis, including image segmentation. In this paper we present a two-stage graph cut based model for segmentation of touching cell nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images. In the first stage voxels with very high probability of being foreground or background are found and separated by a boundary with a minimal geodesic length. In the second stage the obtained clusters are split into isolated cells by combining image gradient information and incorporated a priori knowledge about the shape of the nuclei. Moreover, these two qualities can be easily balanced using a single user parameter. Preliminary tests on real data show promising results of the method.},

This paper presents an evaluation of different representations obtained from the &lt;em&gt;bag of features&lt;/em&gt; approach to classify histopathology images.

FTIR analysis indicates that COOH, C=O, C-O and N-H are the main active binding sites for the process of adsorption. XPS analysis further reveals that Pb (Ⅱ) combines with some active functional groups containing the elements of C, N, O and P. Therefore, the mechanism of saccharomyces cerevisiae adsorption on Pb(Ⅱ) has mainly resulted from both the ion exchange and the surface complexation.},

abstract = {In fluorescence microscopy the noise level and the photobleaching are cross-dependent problems since reducing exposure time to reduce photobleaching degrades image quality while increasing noise level. These two problems cannot be solved independently as a post-processing task, hence the most important contribution in this work is to a-priori denoise and reduce photobleaching simultaneously by using the Compressed Sensing framework (CS). In this paper, we propose a CS-based denoising framework, based on statistical properties of the CS optimality, noise reconstruction characteristics and signal modeling applied to microscopy images with low signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). Our approach has several advantages over traditional denoising methods, since it can under-sample, recover and denoise images simultaneously. We demonstrate with simulated and practical experiments on fluorescence image data that thanks to CS denoising we can obtain images with similar or increased SNR while still being able to reduce exposition times.},

Microscopy can be used to record details of the differentiation process of stem cells under different perturbations and is an important tool for studying stem cell differentiation. Since it is infeasible to quantitatively analyze a huge amount of image data manually, automated image analysis systems are urgently needed. However, the complicated morphological appearances of stem cells are challenging to the existing segmentation methods. Herein, we propose a new, automated scheme for stem cell segmentation. This scheme first uses the multi-scale blob and curvilinear structure detectors to delineate the skeletons of stem cells quickly and then segment out stem cells by refining the skeletons to the cell boundaries using multi-level sets. The initial experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {The (semi-) automatic detection of significant (feature) points is a key task in in vivo assessment of cancer staging and progression. However, this is a challenging task due to the relatively poor signal-to-noise, limited resolution and variable intensity of medical images. We propose to use phase congruence (PC), the Morrone and Owens (1987) feature model, to extract local descriptors. We overcome the limitations of the currently accepted PC measure, estimate PC without using an image energy weighting factor. We show that: (i) relative phase values from a single scale are not equivalent to phase values from PC, and should not be used to assess local image structure; and (ii) our approach results in higher specificity to features of interest, and lower sensitivity to noise, as demonstrated in in vitro microscopy (e.g. tumour microvessels) and in vivo pre-clinical pancreatic cancer images.},

abstract = {In live-cell fluorescence microscopy imaging, quantitative analysis of biological image data generally involves the detection of many subresolution objects, appearing as diffraction-limited spots. Due to acquisition limitations, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be extremely low, making automated spot detection a very challenging task. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the performance of the most frequently used supervised and unsupervised detection methods for this purpose. Experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations for comparison, revealed that for very low SNRs (≅2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall, closely followed by the detectors based on the so-called h-dome transform from mathematical morphology and the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform, which do not require a learning stage. At high SNRs (&gt;5), the difference in performance of all considered detectors becomes negligible.},

abstract = {Biological shape modeling is an essential task that is required for systems biology efforts to simulate complex cell behaviors. Statistical learning methods have been used to build generative shape models based on reconstructive shape parameters extracted from microscope image collections. However, such parametric modeling approaches are usually limited to simple shapes and easily-modeled parameter distributions. Moreover, to maximize the reconstruction accuracy, significant effort is required to design models for specific datasets or patterns. We have therefore developed an instance-based approach to model biological shapes within a shape space built upon diffeomorphic measurement. We also designed a recursive interpolation algorithm to probabilistically synthesize new shape instances using the shape space model and the original instances. The method is quite generalizable and therefore can be applied to most nuclear, cell and protein object shapes, in both 2D and 3D.},

OQM is an optical interferometer whereas the DIC images gradient of the phase.Due to the very different nature of the image formation, the interior of the embryo appears substantially different if not totally uncorrelated between different modalities. We present an algorithm which extracts and aligns the silhouettes of the embryo—the most invariant features between different modalities. The algorithm is tested with 28 image pairs taken from different embryos at various development stages.The success rate is 85.7% if only affine transformation is adopted, and 96% if similarity transformation is allowed for embryos without sufficient outline complexity.},

abstract = {To improve cancer diagnosis and drug development, the classification of tumor types based on genomic information is important. As DNA microarray studies produce a large amount of data, expression data are highly redundant and noisy, and most genes are believed to be uninformative with respect to the studied classes. Only a fraction of genes may present distinct profiles for different classes of samples. Classification tools to deal with these issues are thus important. These tools should learn to robustly identify a subset of informative genes embedded in a large dataset that is contaminated with high dimensional noises. In this paper, an integrated approach of support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for this purpose. The proposed approach can simultaneously optimize the selection of feature subset and the classifier through a common solution coding mechanism. As an illustration, the proposed approach is applied to search the combinational gene signatures for predicting histologic response to chemotherapy of osteosarcoma patients. Crossvalidation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods in terms of classification accuracy. Further validation using an independent dataset shows misclassification of only one out of fourteen patient samples, suggesting that the selected gene signatures can reflect the chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.},

abstract = {Quantitative colocalization analysis in fluorescent microscopy imaging is a promising procedure used to perform functional protein analysis. Images acquired are degraded, and the features extracted are affected by this degradation. Moreover, the classification of the data becomes uncertain. In this paper, we address an application of SOM to a clustering problem formulated via feature extraction from multichannel fluorescence microscopy. First we describe the features that are extracted. Second, we use the PCA/KLT to uncorrelate the data in the hyperplane; and Third, SOM network is trained to find and visualize the clusters (classes) in the data. The SOM model shows the existence of two classes, implying it is possible to design a classifier that distinguishes between images with colocalized structures and without them. We provide quantitative proof of the liability and discriminant capabilities of the feature space.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Control design and improvement of dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) modes and development of new dynamic modes are among the central problems of AFM theory and practice. Proper design can speed up the scan, improve quality, and suggest new useful image channels and algorithms for quantitative measurements at the nanometer scale. This paper provides a rigorous modeling based on first principles and mechanical setting of the AFM. A relationship between the empirical "effective" parameters of mass-spring models and the properties of cantilever and mechanical characteristics of the AFM was formulated. KBM averaging method was used to derive asymptotic dynamics with amplitude and phase as the state variables. Two equations for steady state of this asymptotic dynamics have four unknowns - amplitude, phase, height, and frequency shift. Keeping two of four unknown variables constant (and re-solving other two by the equations for steady state) determines six dynamic AFM modes, of which four are widely used. They are amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) with force spectroscopy and imaging operations. The good match between the simulated and experimental results for AM is found.},

abstract = {Purpose of this paper is realization of high-speed measurement atomic force microscope (AFM) from view point of the control technology without modification of the hardware. Almost commercial AFM, 3D-image is obtained from control input. High-speed imaging is possible if we can design feedback controller which achieves the high-bandwidth servo design. However, we know that it is restricted by bode integral theorem as resonance peak of the plant. For high-speed imaging, our research group proposed surface topography observer which based on the disturbance observer theory. we can locate the pole of the observer without considering of the resonance of the plant. Thus, we succeeded in high-speed imaging by our proposed observer. On the other hand, as the scanning speed of the X scanner becomes faster, the tracking error increases, because the feedback characteristic is same as conventional system. Not only the high-speed imaging but the suppression of the tracking error is important, because the tracking error express the contact force to the sample. Our research group proposed the tracking error suppression methods which are feedforward compensation. This paper describes the dual-directional type surface topography learning observer. This paper shows our proposed methods which are effective for the high-speed AFM by simulation and experimental results.},

Within this research field it is important to understand mechanisms like cell division and elongation of developing cells. We describe a tool to automatically search for cell division in the &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; using information of nuclei shape. The nuclei detection is based on a convergence index filter. Cell division detection is performed by an automatic classifier, trained through cross-validation. The results are further improved by a stability criterion based on the Mahalanobis distance of the shape of the nuclei through time. With this approach, we can achieve a correct detection rate of 94.7%.},

abstract = {Since its inception, the World Wide Web has changed the ways people communicate, collaborate, and educate. There is, however, a growing realization among many researchers that a clear research agenda aimed at understanding the current, evolving, and potential Web is needed. A comprehensive set of research questions is outlined, together with a sub-disciplinary breakdown, emphasising the multi-faceted nature of the Web, and the multi-disciplinary nature of its study and development. These questions and approaches together set out an agenda for Web Science -- a science that seeks to develop, deploy, and understand distributed information systems, systems of humans and machines, operating on a global scale.When we discuss an agenda for a science of the Web, we use the term "science" in two ways. Physical and biological science analyzes the natural world, and tries to find microscopic laws that, extrapolated to the macroscopic realm, would generate the behaviour observed. Computer science, by contrast, though partly analytic, is principally synthetic: it is concerned with the construction of new languages and algorithms in order to produce novel desired computer behaviours. Web science is a combination of these two features. The Web is an engineered space created through formally specified languages and protocols. However, because humans are the creators of Web pages and links between them, their interactions form emergent patterns in the Web at a macroscopic scale. These human interactions are, in turn, governed by social conventions and laws. Web science, therefore, must be inherently interdisciplinary; its goal is to both understand the growth of the Web and to create approaches that allow new powerful and more beneficial patterns to occur. Finally, the Web as a technology is essentially socially embedded; therefore various issues and requirements for Web use and governance are also reviewed.},

Microscopic observations for several needle-gel interactions were used to characterize the interactions at the bevel tip and along the needle shaft. The model design was guided by microscopic observations of several needle-gel interactions. The energy-based model formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters such as rupture toughness, nonlinear material elasticity, and interaction stiffness, and needle geometric and material properties. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in macroscopic experimental studies of a robot-driven needle interacting with different kinds of gels. These results contribute to a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, extending previous work on kinematic models.},

Three-dimensional histological structures are resolved by reconstructing specimen from large stacks of serially sectioned material, which is a preliminary for the spatial assignment of key tissues in differentiation. By sampling and constructing models at different developmental time steps from multiple individuals, we address two aims in a computational phenomics context: i) Generation of averaging atlases as structural references for integration of functional data, and ii) building the basis for a mathematical model of grain morphogenesis. We have established an algorithmic pipeline for automated processing of large image stacks towards phenotypic 3-D models and data-integration, comprising registration, multi-label segmentation, and alignment of functional measurements. The described algorithms allow high-throughput reconstruction and tissue recognition of datasets comprising thousands of images. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated by automated model generation, allowing volumetric measurements of tissue composition, three-dimensional analysis of diversity, and the integration of MALDI-IMS data by mutual information based registration, which is a significant contribution to a systematic analysis of differentiation and development.},

Because of this complexity, there exists a significant amount of interest among clinical professionals and researchers regarding the efficient and accurate prediction of breast cancers. Results: In this paper, we develop a breast cancer prognosis predict system that can assist medical professionals in predicting breast cancer prognosis status based on the clinical data of patients. Our approaches include three steps. Firstly, we select genes based on statistics methodologies. Secondly, we develop three artificial neural network algorithms and four kernel functions of support vector machine for classifying breast cancers based on either clinical features or microarray gene expression data. The results are extremely good; both ANN and SVM have near perfect performance (99 – 100%) for either clinical or microarray data. Finally, we develop a user-friendly breast cancer prognosis predict (BCPP) system that generates prediction results using either support vector machine (SVM) or artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Conclusions: Our approaches are effective in predicting the prognosis of a patient because of the very high accuracy of the results. The BCPP system developed in this study is a novel approach that can be used in the classification of breast cancer.},

This is achieved by proposing a new car-following model called General Individual Based car-following Model (GIBM) which takes into account the characteristics of the individual driver. The model parameters are expressed as functions with regard to “aggressiveness level” of drivers. The numerical simulation of the perturbation propagation in dense traffic flow by using the GIBM shows that small perturbations could develop into stable moving jams, growing moving jam, and decaying moving jams randomly, due to the heterogeneity of individual car-following behaviors in traffic flow. The result of the simulation is consistent with the empirical observation. The GIBM appears promising for application to microscopic simulations of traffic dynamics including randomness. It presents a general approach to simulate the heterogeneity of car-following behaviors efficiently and simply.},

abstract = {Traffic simulators are very cost-effective and time-effective tools for improving infrastructure. Nowadays, microscopic model approaches have been in the limelight for traffic researchers, because they allow for more precise descriptions of the physical road environment as computer power continues to increase. The microscopic simulators focus on individuals within the system and, not the overall extent of the flow. In this paper, we describe IMAGES, which is an intelligent multi-agent system based on microscopic model approaches using longitudinal and lateral models. The multi-agent concept is sufficient to represent drivers' behaviour and cars' features. IMAGES is able to use scenario-based, event-driven, and real-time-based traffic data. Through such a simulation, we estimated freeway traffic flows excluding and including on/off ramps, and we confirmed that unexpected incidents cause traffic congestion. However, data gathered from sensors (loop detectors, cameras, RFID, etc.) should be used much more. This paper is a foundation stone to be built upon; after generating or acquiring data via IMAGES, the next step is studying on the Data Stream Management System (DSMS), which deals with huge amounts of data in real-time.},

abstract = {A novel optical biosensor with gold surface bound silver nanoparticles has been constructed for detection of bio-molecules like antigen, antibody protein and DNA plasmid, which exhibited distinct optical properties of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The silver colloidal nanoparticles were prepared by using sodium borohydride reduction of silver nitrate and characterized by using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV), indicating that the silver colloidals were pure, sphere-shaped and narrow-dispersed size distribution with a diameter of 10 0.5 nm. The silver nanoparticles were well assembled on the gold surface. It caused 3.08 nm of red shift in the peak wavelength (λ  max ) of LSPR spectrum for the nanosensor exposed to c-Myc (3C7) mouse monoclonal IgG and 3.36 nm of red shift to the corresponding antibody by the immuno-reaction subsequently. The LSPR nanobiosensor has been successfully applied to recognition of a DNA plasmid of pCMV-Myc Mammalian Expression Vector.},

abstract = {To further enrich aluminum content in coal fly ash so as to reduce the cost of it as a resource for industrial aluminum extraction, a novel process was developed to separate silicon from the rest of fly ash. The process was conducted by treating the coal fly ash with high concentration sodium hydroxide solution to dissolve silicon as sodium silicate at room temperature under atmosphere. The sodium silicate solution was separated from the high aluminum residue by filtration and was then subjected to treatment with carbon dioxide. When pH of the solution was reached at value A, carbon dioxide ventilation was interrupted and the step was called first carbonization. The filtrate obtained by filtration of the mixture from the first carbonization was subjected to the second carbonization at the same conditions. When pH of the filtrate was reached at value B, carbon dioxide ventilation was terminated and the residual coal fly ash was obtained by filtration. The whole procedure was named as two-step carbonization process. A highly purified nano-silicon dioxide product, in size of 50nm and with purity of 96%, was obtained after washing the coal fly ash residue with water and acid. The processing samples were characterized by transmission electronic microscopy (SED), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy (IR) to illustrate the mechanism of the two-step carbonization process. Major reaction in the first carbonization was taken place between sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide. Significant amount of heat was produced by this reaction. At the same time only a small portion of sodium silicate reacted with carbon dioxide. Most impurities were removed as a result of their adsorption on or reaction with the precipitate produced. The major reaction for the second carbonization was the reaction between sodium silicate and carbon dioxide. Silicon dioxide was precipitated in this step but no significant heat produced. Concentration changes of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate in the first carbonization and sodium silicate in the second carbonization were monitored to reveal the kinetic characteristics of the two-step carbonization process. It was found that the reaction was controlled by the mass transferring resistance on the liquid membrane. The first carbonization was a pseudo-first order rapid reaction between carbon dioxide and sodium hydroxide. The second carbonization, a medium fast multi-phase reaction between carbon dioxide and sodium silicate, was classified as second order reaction. The expressions of mass transfer rate were derived, and the criterion M value was obtained.},

abstract = {In this study, the nanocomposite Ti-Si-N thin flims were prepared by reactive magnetron co-sputtering system. The Ti-Si-N film is a mixed composite consisting of the Ti-Si, Ti-N and Si-N compounds. The TiN phase is polycrystalline while SiNx is amorphous. As Si is added to the Ti-N compound to form Ti-Si-N, the microstructure becomes nanocrystalline grains embedded in an amorphous matrix i.e. nanocomposite quasi-amorphous microstructure, which is also affected by the nitrogen flow ratio (FN  2 %) during co-sputtering. Therefore, the aim is to study the evolution of microstucture and mechanical properties of Ti-Si-N at different FN  2 %. The thickness, structure, morphology, chemical composition and mechanical properties of films were characterized by alpha-stepper profiler, Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and nanoindenter, respectively. The experimental result shows that the deposition rate decreased with increasing N  2  flow rate. According to Scherrer's formula, the grain size of films was below 5 nm. The surface morphology each film was very smooth due to fine grains. The maximum hardness was 21.5 GPa and H 3/E* 2 ratio was 0.321 at 7 FN% which was found at the transformation between polycrystalline and amorphous phases.},

Similarly Motif parameters-based analysis also was introduced to get LER characteristics of the nano-scale grating structure.},

According to the features of medical microscopic image sequence, the SIFT feature detection method of microscopic image registration is introduced. As large dimension of the traditional SIFT descriptor and its complex algorithm, an improved algorithm of the SIFT is presented, which can reduce the dimension. And a two-way matching algorithm is adopted to eliminate repeated matching points. Random Sampling Consensus algorithm (RANSAC) is applied for removal the wrong matching points to improve the accuracy of matching further.

Single stem cells are identified by first detecting their cell nucleoli and then clustering into nuclear groups. Experimental results, for a representative sample of images, are compared with ground truth labeling by skilled biologists.

At present, the procedure is completed by experts of this field by analyzing SEM or LM image of fiber, which is tedious, time-consumed and subjective. In this paper, an objective approach based on neuro-fuzzy classification tool is presented to classify these two types of fiber. Firstly, the color light microscope images of fiber captured by CCD camera are transformed into skelrtonzied binary images only having one pixel wide and showing only fiber and scale edge details. Then four basic shape parameters of fiber scale are measured and a database composed of numerical data of four comparable indexes, which are fiber diameter, scale interval, normalized scale perimeter and normalized scale area, is established. A neuro-fuzzy classifier is developed based on them. The simulation results show that whether on training set or testing set, the model can always distinguish cashmere from fine wool (70s) effectively and the average classification accuracy are higher than 90 percent.},

The system has two levels of description. At the macroscopic level, a user-specified, pre-defined shape is given as input to the system. The system outputs local interaction rules that direct morphogenetic primitives (MP) to aggregate into the shape. At the microscopic level, MPs follow interaction rules based only on local interactions. All MPs are identical and do not know the final shape to be formed. The aggregate is then evaluated at the macroscopic level for its similarity to the user-defined shape. In this paper, we present (1) anemergent system that discovers local interaction rules that direct MPs to form user-defined shapes, (2) the simulation system that implements these rules and causes MPs to self-align and self-organize into a user-defined shape, and (3) the robustness and scalability qualities of the overall approach.},

abstract = {Recent research in the field of complex networks has shown that - beyond microscopic structural qualities - global statistical parameters are sufficient to describe a surprising number of their macroscopic properties. This article argues that such statistical parameters can be monitored by nodes in a decentralized and efficient way. The so achieved awareness of a network's global parameters can be used by nodes for actively influencing them to optimize relevant characteristics of the overall network. For such an adaptation, the network-analogy of "phase transitions" in physical systems can be used. In this article the general concept of such an awareness-driven statistical adaptation is presented using power law networks as an example. For this important class of networks practical algorithms are introduced: Based on recent advances in reliable power law fitting, a gossip scheme has been developed which is suitable to make individual nodes aware of a power law network's critical exponent. In order to influence this parameter, decentralized reconnection rules are presented. The combination of both strategies facilitates a feedback control of large scale systems' emergent power law properties.},

abstract = {Effective building evacuation in case of emergencies such as fires, chemical spills, or spreads of biological agents has long been recognized as an important issue, and effective crowd guidance can improve egress efficiency, occupant survivability, and mitigate or prevent undesirable consequences such as blocking or stampeding. To effectively guide crowds, however, is a challenging issue because emergency events may propagate in uncertain ways and affect the availability of egress paths; egress path capacities may constrain the speed of crowd movement; and crowd could be stressed making their behaviors different from their normal modes. Although good results have recently been obtained on microscopic behaviors of individuals such as the social force model of Helbing [1-3], there is a major gap between these microscopic models of individuals evacuating from rooms and the macroscopic models of crowd flows needed to evacuate them from a building. Most existing egress guidance methods assume that crowd behaviors are independent of emergency situations and are fully controllable under guidance. These assumptions make it difficult to capture important features such as stampeding or blocking.},

abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy provides a powerful method for localization of structures in biological specimens. However, aspects of the image formation process such as noise and blur from the microscope's point-spread function combine to produce an unintuitive image transformation on the true structure of the fluorescing molecules in the specimen, hindering qualitative and quantitative analysis of even simple structures in unprocessed images. We introduce FluoroSim, an interactive fluorescence microscope simulator that can be used to train scientists who use fluorescence microscopy to understand the artifacts that arise from the image formation process, to determine the appropriateness of fluorescence microscopy as an imaging modality in an experiment, and to test and refine hypotheses of model specimens by comparing the output of the simulator to experimental data. FluoroSim renders synthetic fluorescence images from arbitrary geometric models represented as triangle meshes. We describe three rendering algorithms on graphics processing units for computing the convolution of the specimen model with a microscope's point-spread function and report on their performance. We also discuss several cases where the microscope simulator has been used to solve real problems in biology.},

abstract = {In vivo observation and tracking of the  Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem, by time-lapse confocal microscopy, is important to understand mechanisms like cell division and elongation. The research herein described is based on a large amount of image data, which must be analyzed to determine the location and state of cells. The automation of the process of cell detection/marking is an important step to provide research tools for the biologists in order to ease the search for special events, such as cell division. This paper discusses a hybrid approach for automatic cell segmentation, which selects the best cell candidates from a starting watershed-based image segmentation and improves the result by merging adjacent regions. The selection of individual cells is obtained using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, based on the shape and edge strength of the cells' contour. The merging criterion is based on edge strength along the line that connects adjacent cells' centroids. The resulting segmentation is largely pruned of badly segmented and over-segmented cells, thus facilitating the study of cell division.},

The scope of this paper is to describe a coherent architectural framework in order to support adaptive and cognitive behavior of future communication systems, forming synergies from the most microscopic up to the most macroscopic level. Cognitive mechanisms embedded at all scales of a communication system will enable its autonomous hypostasis, facilitating also its self-organization.

At its core, the analysis system consists of a novel weakly supervised classification method, which is based on an iterative morphological algorithm and a soft-margin support vector machine. The lack of objective ground truth labels to validate the system requires the combination of expert knowledge of pathologists. Human expert annotations of more than 2000 cell nuclei from 9 different RCC patients are used to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over existing cell nuclei detection approaches.},

After a series of operations are performed, a simple skeletonized binary representation only having one pixel wide and showing only fiber and scale edge details can be obtained. Four basic shape parameters described above are measured from these images and a database composed of numerical data of four relative indexes is established. A LVQ neural network classification model, including four input nodes, sixteen hidden nodes and two output nodes, are developed on them.

Neuronal function is observed to be closely correlated with the appearance, disappearance and morphology of the spines. Automatic 3-D reconstruction of neurons from light microscopy images, followed by the identification, classification and visualization of dendritic spines is therefore essential for studying neuronal physiology and biophysical properties. In this paper, we present a method to reconstruct dendrites using a surface representation of the dendrite. The 1-D skeleton of the dendritic surface is then extracted by a medial geodesic function that is robust and topologically correct. This is followed by a Bayesian identification and classification of the spines. The dendrite and spines are visualized in a manner that displays the spines' types and the inherent uncertainty in identification and classification. We also describe a user study conducted to validate the accuracy of the classification and the efficacy of the visualization.},

abstract = {Cancer classification using high-throughput mass spectrometry data for early disease detection and prevention has recently become an attractive topic of research in bioinformatics. Recently, several studies have shown that the synergy of proteomic technology and pattern classification techniques is promising for the predictive diagnoses of several cancer diseases. However, the extraction of some effective features that can represent the identities of different classes plays a critical factor for any classification problems involving the analysis of complex data. In this paper we present the concept of a fuzzy fractal dimension that can be utilized as a novel feature of mass spectrometry data. We then applied vector quantization to model the class prototypes using the fuzzy fractal dimensions for classification. Using a simple vector-quantization based classification rule, the overall average classification rates of the proposed approach were found to be superior to some other methods. In bio-imaging classification, we applied vector quantization and Markov modeling methods for cell-phase classification using time-lapse fluorescence microscopic image sequences. However this method is not always effective because cell features are treated with equal weight of importance that may not be always true. We proposed a subspace vector-quantization method to overcome this drawback. The proposed method can automatically weight cell features based on their attribute importance in fuzzy clustering analysis. Two weighting algorithms based on fuzzy c-means and fuzzy entropy clustering were studied, whose performances improved the classification rates.},

Siglet sensing is a way to capture very short and noise-like signals by sensors operating on a low duty ratio. To extract the useful information on workers' communication, speech siglet detection is studied. The LBG trained speech and workplace nonspeech models with Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) as feature vectors are utilized. A hierarchical pruning technique is studied to reduce the calculation cost of the matching process to nearly 25% and refine the classification accuracy. Our approach achieved average speech and nonspeech classification accuracy of 99.96% on 0.1s long test siglets.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis is synonymous to the functional disorder of articular cartilage. Mechanical tests of articular cartilage offer a way to understand the tissue's functionality and osteoarthritis. During normal activities, chondrocytes (cells) are indirectly exposed to varied mechanical compressions exerted on articular cartilage. Study of the morphological response of chondrocytes to the mechanical compressions exerted on articular cartilage offers understanding the physical integrity of chondrocytes, and initial physiological change of articular cartilage for detecting early osteoarthritis.Fibre optic confocal microscopy uses fibre optic imaging technologies to study the internal microstructure of bulk articular cartilage. The technologies have led to develop confocal arthroscopy for in vivo studying the cellular structure of articular cartilage. Using fibre optic laser confocal microscopy and a developed computer image analysis software, we studied the morphological response of the chondrocytes in the superficial and transitional zone to the uniaxial compression of articular cartilage at 0.25MPa and 0.5MPa. The results suggest that the mechanical compression exerted on articular cartilage caused morphological changes of the chondrocytes, which can be measured by the technique described in this study. The technique developed in this study shows potential to develop a methodology for in vivo studying the physiological integrity of chondrocyte and early osteoarthritis.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {We observe the spontaneous emergence of spatial tribes in an animat agent model where simple genetic inheritance is supported. Our predator-prey model simulates a flat-world of animat agents which breed, move, eat and predate according to priorities encoded in their genotype. Initialising a random mixture of all possible priority list genotypes, we find not only that only a small fraction of possible genotypes are favoured for survival, but that distinct spatial patterns of different tribes emerge. We report on the emergent macroscopic features in our model and discuss their correspondent mapping to microscopic animat rules and genotypes. Even a simple gene-reordering mechanism gives rise to complex emergent behaviour.},

abstract = {We present an object-level metric for segmentation performance which was developed to quantify both over- and under-segmentation errors, as well as to penalize segmentations with larger deviations in object shape. This metric is applied to the problem of segmentation of cell nuclei in routinely stained H&amp;E histopathology imagery. We show the correspondence between the metric terms and qualitative observations of segmentation quality, particularly the presence of over- and under-segmentation. The computation of this metric does not require the use of any point-to-point or region-to-region correspondences but rather simple computations using the object mask from both the segmentation and ground truth.},

Since the microscopic traffic flow simulation model can capture a greater level of details of the network, it can closely evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of a controller in a real transportation network before an actual implementation. The highway stretch is based on the Berkeley Highway Laboratory (BHL) and is validated with field data. The validation results show that the model properly captures the congestion characteristics of the BHL section. Also, based on the validated model, critical densities and other traffic flow characteristics in mixed manual and ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) traffics are estimated.},

First, a single template cell is estimated using an Expectation Maximization algorithm applied to a collection of correctly segmented cells from the original image. Next, a process based on matching the template against the clumped shape and removing the matched area is applied iteratively. A chain code representation is used for establishing best correlation between these two shapes. Maximal correlation point is used as an landmark point for the registration approach, which finds the affine transformation that maximises the intersection area between both shapes. Evaluation was carried out on 18 images in which 52 clumped shapes were present. The number of found cells was compared with the number of cells counted by an expert and results show agreement on a 93% of the cases.},

Advances in computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) holds promise for early detecting and staging disease progression. In this paper we introduce a Grid-enabled CAD to perform automatic analysis of imaged histopathology breast tissue specimens. More than 100,000 digitized samples (1200 \texttimes{} 1200 pixels) have already been processed on the Grid. We have analyzed results for 3744 breast tissue samples, which were originated from four different institutions using diaminobenzidine (DAB) and hematoxylin staining. Both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction techniques are compared, and the best one (ISOMAP) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the features. The experimental results show that the Gentle Boosting using an eight node CART decision tree as the weak learner provides the best result for classification. The algorithm has an accuracy of 86.02% using only 20% of the specimens as the training set.},

abstract = {In many data analysis applications, application-level parameters influence the execution time of the data analysis method or program. Some of these parameters also affect the accuracy of output of the analysis. In this work, we investigate execution strategies for adaptive data analysis applications where the user is willing to trade-off accuracy of output for performance gain and vice-versa. In order to meet the user defined quality of service requirements, the system must dynamically select values for the parameters during execution. We propose algorithms for adaptive processing of image tiles at different resolutions so that user defined requirements in terms of accuracy of the result and execution time constraints can be satisfied. We develop heuristics for estimation of accuracy vs performance characteristics of image tiles and for scheduling of the tiles for processing. We implement a demand-driven strategy for parallel execution of these heuristics on a parallel machine. We evaluate our approach for analysis of large images from digitized microscopy scanners.},

As an illustration, we perform intensity independent pixel classification first on a synthetic then on real biological images.},

abstract = {Transmission electron microscope images of biological membranes are difficult to segment because they are low-contrasted images with heterogeneous gray levels. Added to that are the many possible types of membranes, the variable degree of aggregation, and the negative staining of the sample. We therefore develop a multi-scale approach to detect the edges at the appropriate scales. For these images, the study of the amplitude of the first derivative through the scales simplifies the feature tracking and the scale selection. A scale-adapted threshold is automatically applied to gradient images to progressively segment edges through the scales. The edges found at the different scales are then combined into a gradient-like image. The watershed algorithm is finally applied to segment the image into homogeneous regions, automatically selecting the edges found at the finest resolution.},

The proposed models have mainly considered a deterministic point of view to describe the choice of the pedestrians trajectories and to study the critical congested states. But recently it has been pointed out the importance of the individual free will in determining both the microscopic pedestrian behavior and the emergent properties of the crowd dynamics. In this paper we discuss a hierarchical model for pedestrian mobility whose emergent dynamical properties are determined by the bottom-up and top-down actions among the microscopic-level (free-will level), the mesoscopic level (deterministic level) and macroscopic level (cognitive level). The "mobbers" have an internal cognitive dynamics, perform both physical and information based interactions using a vision mechanism and are able to compute a cognitive map representation of the geometrical space.The model has been implemented in the DISTRIMOBS simulator that is designed to simulate a whole city on a distributed architecture. The main properties of the model are discussed and some applications are presented.},

abstract = {Cancer diagnosis is essentially a human task. Almost universally, the process requires the extraction of tissue (biopsy) and examination of its microstructure by a human. To improve diagnoses based on limited and inconsistent morphologic knowledge, a new approach has recently been proposed that uses molecular spectroscopic imaging to utilize microscopic chemical composition for diagnoses. In contrast to visible imaging, the approach results in very large data sets as each pixel contains the entire molecular vibrational spectroscopy data from all chemical species. Here, we propose data handling and analysis strategies to allow computer-based diagnosis of human prostate cancer by applying a novel genetics-based machine learning technique ({tt NAX). We apply this technique to demonstrate both fast learning and accurate classification that, additionally, scales well with parallelization. Preliminary results demonstrate that this approach can improve current clinical practice in diagnosing prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Approximately 50% of all patients with intraocular melanoma die of metastatic disease, despite successful treatment of the primary tumour. The main factors associated with mortality include: tumour diameter; ciliary body involvement; extraocular tumour spread; epithelioid cell type; high mitotic rate; and chromosome 3 loss. We report the development of a web-based prognostic tool, which integrates all these factors. The cohort comprised 2655 patients (1369 male, 1286 female, mean age: 60.86 years) with histopathological data on 1282 patients and cytogenetic information on 405 patients. There were 871 deaths, 517 of which were from metastatic disease. A Conditional Hazard Estimating Neural Network (CHENN) model has been developed, and used to model the survival probability conditioned on observed clinical data. Such model is trained in the Bayesian framework, which allows model training, model regularization, model comparison and feature selection. The CHENN model is nonlinear, embeds the Cox proportional hazards model, and can correct Cox estimates in the cases with a nonlinear relationship between covariates and survival probabilities, and/or the proportional hazards assumption is not verified. As a result of these studies, we can confidently reassure many patients with intraocular melanoma that their survival probability is not significantly worse than that of the general population. This improves their well-being and avoids unnecessary and expensive screening tests. Conversely, we can reliably identify those with a high risk of metastatic death. These patients are referred to an oncologist for systemic screening and several have undergone partial hepatectomy with significant prolongation of life. Our prognostication enhances the feasibility of future randomized, prospective studies evaluating protocols for systemic screening and adjuvant therapy.},

Our work was focused on the identification of lymphomas by finding follicles in microscopy images provided by the Laboratory of Pathology in the University Hospital of Tenerife, Spain. Roughly we can divide our work in two stages: in the first stage we did image pre-processing and feature extraction, and in the second stage we used different rough set approaches for pixel classification. These results were compared to decision tree results we obtained earlier. Symbolic machine learning approaches are often neglected when looking for image analysis tools. The results we got are very promising and show that symbolic approaches can be successful in image analysis applications.},

abstract = {We introduce a framework to characterize and visualize the transverse tubular system of cardiac myocytes imaged with confocal microscopy. We imaged rabbit ventricular cells and cell segments with fluorescein linked to dextran. The image datasets were deconvolved with the Richardson-Lucy algorithm using the point spread function extracted from images of fluorescent beads. The transverse tubular system (t-system) was segmented with the methods of digital image processing. We reconstructed single transverse tubules and quantitatively described these in terms of length, cross-sectional area, ellipticity and orientation. These results should yield geometric markers for studies of protein distribution and provide insights into the function of the t-system.},

abstract = {During the last few years, continuous progresses in wireless communications have opened new research fields in computer networking, aimed at extending data networks connectivity to environments where wired solutions are impracticable. Among these, vehicular traffic is attracting a growing attention from both academia and industry, due to the amount and impor- tance of the related applications, ranging from road safety to traffic control, up to mobile entertainment. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are self-organized networks built up from moving vehicles, and are part of the broader class of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). Because of their peculiar char- acteristics, VANETs require the definition of specific network- ing techniques, whose feasibility and performance are usually tested by means of simulation. One of the main challenges posed by VANETs simulations is the faithful characterization of vehicular mobility at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, leading to realistic non-uniform distributions of cars and ve- locity, and unique connectivity dynamics. In this paper we first present and describe VanetMobiSim, a freely available gener- ator of realistic vehicular movement traces for networks simu- lators.Then, VanetMobiSim is validated by illustrating how the interaction between featured macro- and micro-mobility is able to reproduce typical phenomena of vehicular traffic.},

abstract = {The performance of various low-level motion estimation methods applied to fluorescence labelled growing cellular structures imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy is investigated. This is a challenging and unusual domain for motion estimation methods. A selection of methods are discussed that can be contrasted in terms of how much spatial or temporal contextual information is used. The Lucas Kanade feature tracker, a spatially and temporally localised method, was, as one would expect, accurate around resolvable structure. It was not able to track the smaller, repetitive cell structure in the root tip and was somewhat prone to identifying spurious features. This approach is improved by developing a full multi-frame, robust, Bayesian method, and it is demonstrated that by using extra frames with motion constraints reduces such errors. Next, spatially global methods are discussed, including robust variational smoothing and Markov Random Field (MRF) modelling. A key conclusion that is drawn from investigation of these methods is that generic low-level (robust) smoothing functions do not provide good results in this application and that this is probably due to the large regions with little stable structure. Furthermore, contrary to recently reported successes, graph cuts and loopy belief propagation for MAP estimation of the MRF labels provided often poor and inconsistent estimates. The results suggest the need for greater emphasis on temporal smoothing for generic low-level motion estimation tools and more task specific, spatial constraints, perhaps in the form of high level models in order to accurately recover motion from such data. Finally, the form of the estimated growth is briefly discussed and related to contemporary biological models. We hope that this paper will assist non-specialists in applying state-of-the-art methods to this form of data.},

Plasma spray is currently commercially used for coating dental and orthopaedical implant devices. Sol-gel offers an alternative technique for producing bioactive surfaces for improved bone attachment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for the surface and cross-sectional morphology analysis, while EDX elemental maps were used to define the boundary in the distribution of Ca and P. To evaluate the bioactivity in vitro, the samples were soaked in Kokubo's SBF solution for 10 days. The weights of the samples were obtained, before and after soaking, using an electronic balance with an accuracy of ± 0.0001 g. This study reveals that the sol-gel technique appears to be a good candidate to replace the plasma spray in many biomedical applications.},

abstract = {Due to the limited area of normal skin, immune rejection and high expenses, no wound dressings could completely satisfy clinical demands for extensive burns and large open wounds. An alternative to skin engraftment is to the development of engineering skin constructs to facilitate wound healing, which include a scaffold, support cells, growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM). In this study we fabricated and optimized collagen-blended PLGA nanofibers by electrospinning techniques. Both Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) micrographs verify the nanometer scale and smooth morphology of the blended nanofibers, revealed that 8% is the best concentration for preparing the polymer solution. Attenuated Total Reflectance - Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) demonstrates that blended nanofibers are a mixture of PLGA and collagen. Mechanical tests of their tensile properties show the ultimate strain value and tensile modulus of blended nanofibers are comparable to those of human skin. Contact Angle Assessment shows their decreased hydrophobicity compared with pure PLGA nanofibers and suggests the improved capability for cell attachment. Therefore, this new type of blended nanofiber substrate holds a great potential to facilitate wound healing in skin tissue engineering by being loaded with necessary growth factors and ECM molecules on it.},

Collagen fibers realigned along the stress axis at low stresses, and straightened at physiologic and higher stresses. Explicit correlations were found between the morphometric parameters of aortic wall and the level of mechanical stress, involving participation of elastin alone in transmitting low stresses, and of both elastin and collagen in transmitting physiologic and high stresses.},

abstract = {Markov modeling of conformational kinetics of cardiac ion channels is a prospective means to correlate the molecular defects of channel proteins to their electrophysiological dysfunction. However, both the identifiability of the microscopic conformations and the estimation of the transition rates are challenging. In this paper, we present a new method in which the distribution space of the time constants of exponential components of mathematical models are searched as an alternative to the consideration of transition rates. Transition rate patterns were defined and quasi random seed sequences for each pattern were generated by using a multiple recursive generator algorithm. Cluster-wide Monte Carlo simulation was performed to investigate various schemes of Markov models. It was found that by increasing the number of closed conformations the time constants were shifted to larger magnitudes. With the inclusion of inactivation conformation the time distribution was altered depending on the topology of the schemes. Further results demonstrated the stability of the morphology of time distributions. Our study provides the statistical evaluation of the time constant space of Markov schemes. The method facilities the identification of the underlying models and the estimation of parameters, hence is proposed for use in investigating the functional consequences of defective genes responsible for ion channel diseases.},

The successful fusion of images acquired from different modalities or instruments is of great importance in many applications such as medical imaging, microscopic imaging, remote sensing, computer vision, and robotics. In the present work, four different image fusion techniques were implemented and applied to Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI). These are the Laplacian Pyramid, the Wavelet Transform, the Computationally Efficient Pixel-level Image Fusion (CEMIF) method, and the Multi-focus Technique based on Spatial Frequency. Fusion results were evaluated according to three measures of performance; the entropy, the cross entropy and the spatial frequency. Image fusion techniques were applied to facilitate detection of hepatic lesions by fusing MRI and CT images at the same level. The fused images had led to higher detection accuracy than using either CT or MR images.},

abstract = {Various heterogeneous materials with multiple scales and multiple phases in the microstructure have been produced in the recent years. We consider a mechanical failure due to the initiation and propagation of cracks in places of high pore density in the microstructures. A multi-scale method based on the asymptotic homogenization theory together with the mesh superposition method (s-version of FEM) is presented for modeling of cracks. The homogenization approach is used on the global domain excluding the vicinity of the crack where the periodicity of the microstructures is lost and this approach fails. The multiple scale method relies on efficient combination of both macroscopic and microscopic models. The mesh superposition method uses two independent (global and local) finite element meshes and the concept of superposing the local mesh onto the global continuous mesh in such a way that both meshes not necessarily coincide. The homogenized material model is considered on the global mesh while the crack is analyzed in the local domain (patch) which allows to have an arbitrary geometry with respect to the underlying global finite elements. Numerical experiments for biomorphic cellular ceramics with porous microstructures produced from natural wood are presented.},

abstract = {This article tackles the registration of 2-D biological images (histological sections, autoradiographs, cryosections, etc.). The large variety of registration applications – 3D volume reconstruction, cross-dye histology gene mapping, etc. – induce an equally diverse set of requirements in terms of accuracy and robustness. In turn, these directly translate into regularization constraints on the deformation model, which should ideally be specifiable in a user-friendly fashion.We propose an adaptive regularization approach where the rigidity constraints are informed by the registration application at hand and whose support is controlled by the geometry of the images to be registered.We investigate the behavior of this technique and discuss its sensitivity to the rigidity parameter.},

Our database consisted of mediolateral oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) magnification mammograms obtained from 77 patients, which included 14 invasive carcinomas, 17 noninvasive carcinomas of comedo type, 17 noninvasive carcinomas of noncomedo type, 14 mastopathies, and 15 fibroadenomas. Five features on clustered microcalcifications were determined from each of MLO and CC images by taking into account image features that experienced radiologists commonly use to identify histological classifications. Modified Bayes discriminant function (MBDF) was employed for distinguishing between histological classifications. For the input of MBDF, we used five or ten features obtained from MLO and/or CC images. With ten features, the classification accuracies for each histological classification ranged from 70.6% to 93.3%. This result was higher than that obtained with only five features either from MLO or CC images.},

In this paper, we calculate the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites embedded with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based on the representative volume element (RVE) concept. The RVE, which encompasses a single CNT, was constructed assuming that the CNTs are distributed in polymeric material homogeneously, and also assuming that the CNTs have no interaction with other CNTs. This research describes the thermal characteristics of nanoscale materials – CNTs filled nanocomposites – as a case study and measured their thermal conductivity, for the purpose of validation of numerical results. The dispersion state of the CNTs was observed using field emission scanning electronic microscope (FESEM). We found that the numerically predicted thermal conductivity is closely matches the experimental one and that the numerical tool employed in the study is superior to other analytical and numerical methods.},

abstract = {The function of the human brain arises from computations that occur within and among billions of nerve cells known as neurons. A neuron is composed primarily of a cell body (soma) from which emanates a collection of branching structures (dendrites). How neuronal signals are processed is dependent on the dendrites' specific morphology and distribution of voltage-gated ion channels. To understand this processing, it is necessary to acquire an accurate structural analysis of the cell. Toward this end, we present an automated reconstruction system which extracts the morphology of neurons imaged from confocal and multi-photon microscopes. As we place emphasis on this being a rapid (and therefore automated) process, we have developed several techniques that provide high-quality reconstructions with minimal human interaction. In addition to generating a tree of connected cylinders representing the reconstructed neuron, a computational model is also created for purposes of performing functional simulations. We present visual and statistical results from reconstructions performed both on real image volumes and on noised synthetic data from the Duke-Southampton archive.},

Identification of the printing process greatly aids in detecting such activities and is extensively used in the field of document examination. In this paper, we propose the use of image processing techniques in identifying the printing process used to generate a document. The characteristics of the various types of non-impact printing methods used by photocopiers, inkjet and laser printers are studied using colour image processing. HSV color space and, in particular, hue images at high-resolution, distribution of isolated spots in the vicinity of hue edge pixels and periodicities in edge intensity profiles distinguish between the different printing processes. Our initial study indicates their promise in replicating the results traditionally obtained by document examiners using a microscope or through chemical analysis.},

We combine two strategies to make the algorithm robust against focus errors due to low bacteria densities and the presence of dirt. First, we acquire a number of focus estimates for different fields on each slide well using a correlation-based focus measure. A planar model is fitted to these initial estimates using robust regression. The fit parameters provide information about slide tilt and the variability of the focus positions. We use this to constrain the search range to the locally optimal range for each field. Second, we introduce a heuristic pre-filteringstep, based on a morphological area opening, into the computation of the focus measure to suppress false maxima arising from the presence of dirt particles. The effectiveness of both steps is demonstrated by focus results obtained for a sample slide.},

abstract = {Microscopic analysis of malicious code (malware) requires the aid of a variety of powerful tools. Chief among them is a debugger that enables runtime binary analysis at an instruction level. One of the important services provided by a debugger is the ability to stop execution of code at an arbitrary point during runtime, using breakpoints. Software breakpoints support an unlimited number of breakpoint locations by changing the code being debugged so that it can be interrupted during runtime. Most, if not all, malware are very sensitive to code modification with self-modifying and/or self-checking (SM-SC) capabilities, rendering the use of software breakpoints limited in their scope. Hardware breakpoints supported by the underlying processor, on the other hand, use a subset of the processor register set and exception mechanisms to provide breakpoints that do not entail code modification. This makes hardware breakpoints the most powerful breakpoint mechanism for malware analysis. However, current processors provide a very limited number of hardware breakpoints (typically 2-4 locations). Thus, a serious restriction is imposed on the debugger to set a desired number of breakpoints without resorting to the limited alternative of software breakpoints. Also, with the ever evolving nature of malware, there are techniques being employed that prevent the use of hardware breakpoints. This calls for a new breakpoint mechanism that retains the features of hardware breakpoints while providing an unlimited number of breakpoints, which cannot be detected or countered. In this paper, we present the concept of stealth breakpoints and discuss the design and implementation of VAMPiRE 1, a realization of this concept. VAMPiRE cannot be detected or countered and provides unlimited number of breakpoints to be set on code, data, and I/O with the same precision as that of hardware breakpoints. It does so by employing a subtle combination of simple stealth techniques using virtual memory and hardware single-stepping mechanisms that are available on all processors, old and new. This technique makes VAMPiRE portable to any architecture, providing powerful breakpoint ability similar to hardware breakpoints for microscopic malware analysis.},

This approach has great potential to reduce the training expense in many medical image analysis applications. The main contributions lie in a new strategy to combine confidence-rated classifiers learned on different feature sets and a robust way to evaluate the “informativeness” of each unlabeled example. Our framework is applied to the problem of classifying microscopic cell images. The experimental results show that 1) our strategy is more effective than simply multiplying the predicted probabilities, 2) the error rate of high-confidence predictions is much lower than the average error rate, and 3) hand-labeling informative examples with low-confidence predictions improves performance efficiently and the performance difference from hand-labeling all unlabeled data is very small.},

The SNR is shown to be drastically improved and the enhanced vesicles can be segmented. This novel approach can be further exploited for biological studies where the dynamics of small objects of interest have to be analyzed in molecular and sub-cellular bio-imaging.},

abstract = {Over the past few years the popularity of the Internet has been growing by leaps and bounds. However, there comes a time in the life of a technology, as it matures, where questions about its future need to be answered. The Internet is no exception to this case. Often called the “next big thing” in global Internet technology, Grid computing is viewed as one of the top candidates that can shape the future of the Internet. Grid Computing takes collective advantage of the vast improvements in microprocessor speeds, optical communications, raw storage capacity, World Wide Web and the Internet that have occurred over the last five years. Grid technology leverages existing resources and delays the need to purchase new infrastructure. With demand for computer power in industries like the life sciences and health informatics almost unlimited, Grids ability to deliver greater power at less cost gives the technology tremendous potential. Ultimately the Grid must be evaluated in terms of the applications, business value, and scientific results that it delivers, not its architecture. Biology provides some of the most important, as well as most complex, scientific challenges of our times. These problems include understanding the human genome, discovering the structure and functions of the proteins that the genes encode, and using this information efficiently for drug design. Most of these problems are extremely intensive from a computational perspective. One of the principal design goals for the Grid framework is the effective logical separation of the complexities of programming a massively parallel machine from the complexities of bioinformatics computations through the definition of appropriate interfaces. Encapsulation of the semantics of the bioinformatics computations methodologies means that the application can track the evolution of the machine architecture and explorations of various parallel decomposition schemes can take place with minimal intervention from the domain experts or the end users. For example, understanding the physical basis of protein function is a central objective of molecular biology. Proteins function through internal motion and interaction with their environment. An understanding of protein motion at the atomic level has been pursued since the earliest simulations of their dynamics. When simulations can connect to experimental results, the microscopic examinations of the different processes (via simulation) acquire more credibility and the simulation results can then help interpret the experimental data. Improvements in computational power and simulation methods facilitated by the Grid framework could to lead to important progress in studies of protein structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics. This talk will review the state of play and show how Grid technology can change the competitive landscape.},

This paper shows that if cells are imaged over time, segmentation results from a previous time frame can be used as seeds for watershed segmentation of the current time frame. The seeds from the previous frame are combined with morphological seeds from the current frame, and over-segmentation is reduced by rule-based merging, propagating labels from one time-frame to the next. Thus, watershed segmentation is used for segmentation as well as tracking of cells over time. The described algorithm was tested on neural stem/progenitor cells imaged using time-lapse microscopy. Tracking results agreed to 71% to manual tracking results. The results were also compared to tracking based on solving the assignment problem using a modified version of the auction algorithm.},

abstract = {3D volumetric microscopical techniques (e.g. confocal laser scanning microscopy) have become a standard tool in biomedical applications to record three-dimensional objects with highly anisotropic morphology. To analyze these data in high-throughput experiments, reliable, easy to use and generally applicable pattern recognition tools are required. The major problem of nearly all existing applications is their high specialization to exact one problem, and the their time-consuming adaption to new problems, that has to be done by pattern recognition experts. We therefore search for a tool that can be adapted to new problems just by an interactive training process. Our main idea is therefore to combine object segmentation and recognition into one step by computing voxel-wise gray scale invariants (using nonlinear kernel functions and Haar-integration) on the volumetric multi-channel data set and classify each voxel using support vector machines.After the selection of an appropriate set of nonlinear kernel functions (which allows to integrate previous knowledge, but still needs some expertise), this approach allows a biologist to adapt the recognition system for his problem just by interactively selecting several voxels as training points for each class of objects. Based on these points the classification result is computed and the biologist may refine it by selecting additional training points until the result meets his needs. In this paper we present the theoretical background and a fast approximative algorithm using FFTs for computing Haar-integrals over the very rich class of nonlinear 3-point-kernel functions. The approximation still fulfils the invariance conditions. The experimental application for the recognition of different cell cores of the chorioallantoic membrane is presented in the accompanying paper [1] and in the technical report [2]},

The segmentation technique segments each cell image into three regions, i.e., nucleus, cytoplasm, and background. We evaluate the segmentation performance of the proposed technique by comparing its results with the cell images manually segmented by an expert. The probability of error in image segmentation is utilized as an evaluation measure in the comparison. From the experiments, we achieve good segmentation performances in the entire cell and nucleus segmentation. The six-class cell classification problem is also investigated by using the automatic segmented images. We extract four features from the segmented images including the cell area, the peak location of pattern spectrum, the first and second granulometric moments of nucleus. Even though the boundaries between cell classes are not well-defined and there are classification variations among experts, we achieve a promising classification performance using neural networks with five-fold cross validation.},

Far more different from traditional color imaging analysis methods, a multispectral imaging techniques for image analysis is introduced. Multispectral image can not only show the spatial features of a cell, but also reveal the unique spectral information of each pixel. The supported vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed to train the spectrum vector of a pixel, and the output of the classifier can indicate the class type of the pixel: nucleus, erythrocytes, cytoplasm and background. Experimental results show that, compared with any other method previously reported, our method is more robust, precise and insensitive to smear staining and illumination condition.},

abstract = {Mechanical dynamics can be a determining factor for the switching speed of radio-frequency micro electromechanical systems (RF MEMS) switches. This paper presents the simulation of the mechanical motion of a microswitch under actuation. The switch has a plate suspended by springs. When an electrostatic actuation is applied, the plate moves toward the substrate and closes the switch. Simulations are calculated via a high-fidelity finite element model that couples solid dynamics with electrostatic actuation. It incorporates non-linear coupled dynamics and accommodates fabrication variations. Experimental modal analysis gives results in the frequency domain that verifies the natural frequencies and mode shapes predicted by the model. An effective 1D model is created and used to calculate an actuation voltage waveform that minimizes switch velocity at closure. In the experiment, the switch is actuated with this actuation voltage, and the displacements of the switch at various points are measured using a laser Doppler velocimeter through a microscope. The experiments are repeated on several switches from different batches. The experimental results verify the model.},

Accurate image segmentation of skin lesions is one of the key steps for useful, early, and non-invasive diagnosis of cutaneous melanomas. In this paper, a modified segmentation algorithm has been used to extract the true border that reveals the global structure irregularity (indentations and protrusions), which may suggest excessive cell growth or regression of a melanoma. The algorithm is applied to the blue channel of the RGB colour vectors to distinguish lesions from the skin and uses background noise reduction to enhance and filter the image of lesion. The algorithm also does not depend on the use of rigid threshold values, because an optimal thresholding algorithm "isodata algorithm" that is used determines an optimal threshold iteratively. Preliminary experiments are performed on diversity of clinical skin images and high resolution ELM images to verify the capability of the segmentation algorithm in extracting and characterizing the true features of the processed skin lesions. We demonstrate that we can enhance and delineate pigmented networks in skin lesions visually, and make them accessible for further analysis and classification.},

abstract = {As technology advances into the nanometer territory, the interconnect delay has become a first-order effect on chip performance. To handle this effect, the X-architecture has been proposed for high-performance integrated circuits. The X-architecture presents a new way of orienting a chip's microscopic interconnect wires with the pervasive use of diagonal routes. It can reduce the wirelength and via count, and thus improve performance and routability. Furthermore, the continuous increase of the problem size of IC routing is also a great challenge to existing routing algorithms. In this paper, we present the first multilevel framework for full-chip routing using the X-architecture. To take full advantage of the X-architecture, we explore the optimal routing for three-terminal nets on the X-architecture and develop a general X-Steiner tree algorithm based on the delaunay triangulation approach for the X-architecture. The multilevel routing framework adopts a two-stage technique of coarsening followed by uncoarsening, with a trapezoid-shaped track assignment embedded between the two stages to assign long, straight diagonal segments for wirelength reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art multilevel routing for the Manhattan architecture, experimental results show that our approach reduced wirelength by 18.7% and average delay by 8.8% with similar routing completion rates and via counts.},

In this paper, we consider the construction and selective presentation of cells of the Morse-Smale complex and their use in the analysis and visualization of scientific datasets. We take advantage of the fact that cells of different dimension often characterize different types of features present in the data. For example, critical points pinpoint changes in topology by showing where components of the level sets are created, destroyed or modified in genus. Edges of the Morse-Smale complex extract filament-like features that are not explicitly modeled in the original data. Interactive selection and rendering of portions of the Morse-Smale complex introduces fundamental data management challenges due to the unstructured nature of the complex even for structured inputs. We describe a data structure that stores the Morse-Smale complex and allows efficient selective traversal of regions of interest. Finally, we illustrate the practical use of this approach by applying it to cryo-electron microscopy data of protein molecules.},

We present an SSFnet-based microscopic simulation of the containment strategy against random scan worms, and explore various performance characteristics of the group defense mechanism.

abstract = {In order to supply a growing tissue with oxygen and nutrients and to remove its metabolic wastes, blood vessels penetrating the tissue are formed. Multiple mechanisms are involved in this process ranging over many orders of magnitude: chemical signaling on the bio-molecular level (10−9m), genetic program on the protein level (10−7m), microscopic mechanical cell interactions (10−5m) and external forces and stresses reaching macroscopic scales (&gt; 10−3m). Better physiological understanding of this phenomenon could result in many useful medical applications, for example in gene therapy or cancer treatment. We present a simulation framework to study mechanical aspects of the micro-vascular growth using techniques from computational geometry, solid mechanics, computational fluid dynamics and data visualization. Vasculogenesis is modeled as traction driven remodeling of an initially uniform tissue in absence of blood flow. Angiogenesis, the subsequent formation and maturation of blood vessels, is handled as a flow driven remodeling of a porous structure resulting from the preceding stage. The mechanical model of tissue response to the traction forces successfully predicts spontaneous formation of primitive capillary networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a shear-stress controlled remodeling of such structures can lead to flow fingering effects observed in real cellular media.},

Secondly, vehicle movement on urban streets is simulated, based on the assumption of velocity following a Gaussian (normal) distribution and is calibrated by field data. Thirdly, driver behaviour is modelled, using a truncated Gaussian distribution. Finally, the limited priority mechanism is involved in this paper.

The motivation behind this is that optimization of traffic light control is starting to be integrated with navigation support for drivers. We use microscopic, agent-based modelling and simulation, in opposition to the classical network analysis, as this work focuses on the effect of local adaptation. In a scenario that exhibits features comparable to real-world networks, we evaluate different types of adaptation by drivers and by traffic lights, based on local perceptions. In order to compare the performance, we have also used a global level optimization method based on genetic algorithms.},

In the context of the cybersecurity profession, the ‘isolation problem’ refers to the observed isolation of different knowledge units, as well as the isolation of technical and business perspectives. Due to limitations in existing cybersecurity education, professionals entering the field are often trapped in microscopic perspectives, and struggle to extend their findings to grasp the big picture in a target network scenario. Guided by a previous developed and published framework named “cross-layer situation knowledge reference model” (SKRM), which delivers comprehensive level big picture situation awareness, our new methodology targets at developing suites of teaching modules to address the above issues. The modules, featuring interactive hands-on labs that emulate real-world multiple-step attacks, will help students form a knowledge network instead of isolated conceptual knowledge units. Students will not just be required to leverage various techniques/tools to analyze breakpoints and complete individual modules; they will be required to connect logically the outputs of these techniques/tools to infer the ground truth and gain big picture awareness of the cyber situation. The modules will be able to be used separately or as a whole in a typical network security course.},

In order to compensate for the system dynamics of the used piezo-electric actuator, amplitude and phase response at these frequencies are identified. By adjusting amplitude and phase of each individual frequency component, the tracking error is reduced significantly. The presented method also demonstrates its capability of improving the non-linear behavior of piezoelectric actuators. The technique is experimentally evaluated on a piezo-electric stack-actuator, used as fast Z-actuator within an atomic force microscope (AFM). Comparing the presented method to an uncompensated triangular signal as well as input shaping methods, presented in literature, shows a significant reduction of tracking error of 84% and 65%, respectively.},

We detail pedestrian model elements that govern microscopic agent movement such as personal space preservation, obstacle avoidance and moving together as a crowd. We validate the EvacSim pedestrian model against real-world pedestrian data, comparing flow rates, density and velocity for corridor entry and for merging crowds, and we demonstrate that EvacSim simulations are consistent with the real-world data.},

abstract = {Security property degrees systematize the angles from which one can discuss the security of a system. Microscopic properties characterize how specific actions affect parts of a system. Mesoscopic properties describe how the pursuit of an attack objective may affect the system and the attacker. Macroscopic properties represent the interaction of a threat environment with a system. Properties of different degrees are interdependent, but not in a simple and universal manner.Security design aims to control security properties, shaping them in a favorable way. Its objective is macroscopic control through design decisions on all three degrees. Design tools today occupy mostly the lower half of the property degree scale. A few macroscopic design aids exist but provide little guidance to engineers.Security designers are thus in a similar situation as photographers, having to make fundamental design decisions without methodologies other than their private, homegrown approaches. This is essential for art but a deficiency in engineering. Standardized mechanization in point-and-shoot cameras helps inexpert photographers to a limited extent but can get in the way of the experienced and ambitious. Point-and-shoot security design, shorthand for current practice as well as a widely held expectation, may do the same to security engineers.},

abstract = {Perovskite materials are crucial in a variety of important technological applications. Using quantum-mechanical simulations and accurate molecular dynamics models, we have computationally investigated ferroelectric materials for applications in computer memory, piezoelectrics and photovoltaics. By tuning the applied electric pulses' shaping and delay separation, we find the lower limit for tetragonal PbTiO$ 3$ polarization switching time period is on the scale of 10 pico seconds. Structural and electronic properties of a semiconductor non-oxide perovskite BaZrS$ {3}$ are investigated in detail. We also microscopically model relax or behavior demonstrated by the next generation piezoelectric devices, not only reproducing dielectric response but also revealing the significance of local crystal chemistry.},
