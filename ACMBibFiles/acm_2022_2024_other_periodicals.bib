abstract = {The Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a pathological image with Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining. The low-contrast color staining will bring a challenge on analysis. We propose SNSeg (Staining Nuclear Segmentation) to improve the segmentation performance in WSI, for obtaining accurate nuclear region. At the macro level, we reconstructed the feature fusion mode and connection path, for reducing semantic loss in the gradient descent. At the micro level, first, we design a multiple receptive field convolution unit (RFC), and it can adjust the receptive field for adapting to the nuclei size of the input image. Secondly, for efficiently fusing the feature information extracted from the encoder, we design a multi-branch channel attention fusion unit (MCA), which integrates different branch information flows in channel-wise to a unified module. Finally, we design parallel outputting decoder fusion (DF) module to fuse outputting spatial attention for generating the final segmentation results. In addition, we introduce the watershed based on distance transformation to separate adherent nuclei and mark contours. We design experiments for verifying SNSeg on public datasets of MoNuSeg, TNBC, and PanNuKe. The segmentation results on MoNuSeg show that the SNSeg has achieves an accuracy of 84.32% and a Dice score of 81.21%. Compared with other networks, the SNSeg have competitive advantages in segmentation performance and network parameters.},

abstract = {Cell phenotype classification is a critical task in many medical applications, such as protein localization, gene effect identification, and cancer diagnosis in some types. Fluorescence imaging is the most efficient tool to analyze the biological characteristics of cells. So cell phenotype classification in fluorescence microscopy images has received increased attention from scientists in the last decade. The visible structures of cells are usually different in terms of shape, texture, relationship between intensities, etc. In this scope, most of the presented approaches use one type or joint of low-level and high-level features. In this paper, a new approach is proposed based on a combination of low-level and high-level features. An improved version of local quinary patterns is used to extract low-level texture features. Also, an innovative multilayer deep feature extraction method is performed to extract high-level features from DenseNet. In this respect, an output feature map of dense blocks is entered in a separate way to pooling and flatten layers, and finally, feature vectors are concatenated. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the benchmark dataset 2D-HeLa in terms of accuracy. Also, the proposed approach is compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. Comparison of results demonstrates higher performance of the proposed approach in comparison with some efficient methods.},

abstract = {Manual analysis and judgement system suffered by two boundaries: first, studying histological slides by manual human's effort is time overhead and the human specialists are not permanently obtainable. Secondly, a lot of work has been done to outline diagnostic standards for all tumour components. CAD is quickly developing owing to the obtainability of up-to-date computing procedures, fresh imaging tools, plus patient data for infection diagnosis. Decision making using computer-assisted can be used to enhance histopathologists by providing additional objective diagnostic and analytic parameters. Recently, tumour has become one of the diseases that affect human health the most. Brain is a central system for human bodies that control, organise and arrange regular habit tasks. This paper talks about meningiomas tumour, which is considered one of the popular brain tumours. Colour-based segmentation, is a morphological operation used to enhance the appearance of cells. Texture-based features (FOS, GLCM, GLRS, GLDS and NGTDM) are used to enhance CAD feature extraction process and two classifiers are used to improve decision making (SVM and KNN).},

Phytochemical screening of O. dillenii showed the presence of alkaloids, betacyanin, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, and phlobatannins. The characterizations of the synthesized metal NPs were performed such as UV-visible spectrophotometer, FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectrophotometer, SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray). Through the application of such advance techniques, the UV-visible spectrophotometer showed the bands of absorbance for AgNPs and AuNPs at 420 nm and 525 nm range, respectively. The FTIR spectra for both and AgNPs also appeared in the range of 4000-400 cm-1. SEM was performed for the textural and morphological characteristics of the NPs such as shape, size distribution, and surface structure. Elemental analysis was recorded for the synthesis of Au and AgNPs, which confirmed its purity. The O. dillenii extract and their synthesized Au and AgNPs showed a clear zone of inhibition against the E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumonia, and P. aeruginosa bacteria and T. viride, C. albicans, C. krusei, and A. niger fungal species.},

abstract = {Most of the microscopic images of Harmful Algae Blooms (HABs) acquired in marine engineering are subject to blurred cell textures and poor overall clarity due to the effects of seawater impurities, unknown suspended particle deposits and high-speed cell motions. To solve the above problems, a microscopic image enhancement method based on the recursive-overlapped contrast limited adaptive histogram specification (CLAHS) and dual-image wavelet fusion (RO-CLAHS and DIWF) is proposed in this paper. It combines three main steps: homomorphic filtering, empirical modal feature map extraction, and dual-image wavelet fusion. This method firstly adopts homomorphic filtering to strengthen the illumination uniformity of the entire HABs image, and then obtains an empirical modal feature map of algal cells by an improved empirical modal decomposition method, which highlights the detailed features of algal cells due to histogram stretching, clip limit and grey-level mapping. Finally, this paper proposes a dual-image wavelet fusion method adapted for HAB microscopic images, which integrates the images processed by contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) with an empirical modal feature map and then achieves the image enhancement effect. The comparison experimental results show that the enhanced microscopic images of HABs by this method presents the best texture clarity and global contrast and improves the accuracy of algae image edge detection significantly.},

abstract = {Cervical dysplasia is a cancerous condition, and it is essential to correctly identify them from Pap smear images using machine intelligence. Regular screening and early diagnosis is the most vital step for detecting dysplastic stage, so as to treat them effectively. However, the manual inspection of Papanicolaou test screened under microscope is laborious, subjective and time-consuming task. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop an artificial intelligence-enabled assistive tool to detect the cervical dysplasia cancer. Here, the pixel-based segmentation to classification mapping approach is introduced which is the two-step classification, i.e. cell segmentation and cell classification. In cell segmentation stage, the novel filter to feature map approach is used. Total 112 filtered images were generated from each original cell images. The feature vector was then created for every original pixel using filtered images. In Dysplasia cancer classification stage, the 163 features consisting the edge detector, texture, noise, membrane detector and colour features are considered. Three classifiers, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), are used to detect and diagnose the dysplasia stage cancer. These classifiers are evaluated for performance using seven different performance measures. For cell segmentation approach, the RF reported accuracy of 99.07% and it outperformed in terms of accuracy over ANN and SVM classifiers. Finally, the cervical dysplasia is accurately identified with 97.5% accuracy using ANN as compared to SVM and RF.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant cancers worldwide. To reduce cancer mortality, early diagnosis and treatment are essential in leading to a greater improvement and survival length of patients. In this paper, a hybrid feature selection technique (RF-GWO) based on random forest (RF) algorithm and gray wolf optimization (GWO) was proposed for handling high dimensional and redundant datasets for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Feature selection aims to properly select the minimal most relevant subset of features out of a vast amount of complex noisy data to reach high classification accuracy. Gray wolf optimization (GWO) and random forest (RF) algorithm were utilized to find the most suitable features in the histological images of the human colorectal cancer dataset. Then, based on the best-selected features, the artificial neural networks (ANNs) classifier was applied to classify multiclass texture analysis in colorectal cancer. A comparison between the GWO and another optimizer technique particle swarm optimization (PSO) was also conducted to determine which technique is the most successful in the enhancement of the RF algorithm. Furthermore, it is crucial to select an optimizer technique having the capability of removing redundant features and attaining the optimal feature subset and therefore achieving high CRC classification performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity rates. The Heidelberg University Medical Center Pathology archive was used for performance check of the proposed method which was found to outperform benchmark approaches. The results revealed that the proposed feature selection method (GWO-RF) has outperformed the other state of art methods where it achieved overall accuracy, precision, and sensitivity rates of 98.74%, 98.88%, and 98.63%, respectively.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles being the backbone of nanotechnology gain more attention nowadays as they are entirely different from the colloids and also exhibit unique electrochemical, physical, and optical properties corresponding to their dimensions and shape. The core concept of getting nanoparticles from metal colloids lies on the traditional approach that is applied in both conventional and mechanical methods these days. Among those, the techniques that rely on the biological systems for the generation of nanoparticles have more merits and precedence over other environmental mechanisms as this mitigates the expense as well as toxicity. Considering both nutritional and medicinal values of mushrooms, they were properly managed, adopted, and accustomed in distinct skills to get desired products of nanosizes. Gold is commonly known as a noble metal, and it owns enormous medicinal values since long time in history. Here, a mycosynthesis approach was applied; by the way, the mushroom Laetiporus versisporus and gold ions collaborate to bring out gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized by the involvement of Laetiporus versisporus. Mycosynthesis deals with an environmentally friendly process that leads to the extracellular synthesis of AuNPs. The Laetiporus versisporus were collected from hills of Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu. The gold source turned into ultrafiner particles which were then computed and monitored through UV-Vis spectrophotometer and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and the texture of particles was affirmed with the help of peaks originated in X-ray diffraction (XRD). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques and scanning electron microscope (SEM) unveiled spherical AuNPs, and the overall scale of which was figured as 10 nm. Various concentrations of AuNPs by the concentration of extracted Laetiporus versisporus were evaluated for antioxidant activity using the standard in vitro methods like ferrous ion chelating effect, nitric oxide (NO) scavenging assay, and DPPH assay activity.},

abstract = {In medical science, the scrutiny of blood smears for the abnormality in erythrocyte, leads to decisive determination of several ailments like Thalasemia, Liver disease, Sickle cell anaemia and so on. The conventional methodology for determining the malformation of the erythrocytes is through visual inspection of the blood smear through light or compound microscope. Since, the process of such examination is manual, it might lead to discrepancies and subjectivity. It is a well-known fact that early and affordable diagnostics can make a significant impact on curative. Hence, this research study has proposed an image analysis perspective to characterize the erythrocytes based on their morphological changes. The prime objective of this research work is to enhance the preliminary screening of erythrocytes by analyzing the morphological, textural, and color features by the proposed model FC-TriSDR (Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm along with three ensembled classifiers- Support vector machine, Decision Tree, and Radial Basis Functional Neural Network). Automated identification and characterization of erythrocytes is accomplished by integrating the steps of image acquisition, preprocessing, sub-imaging, image segmentation, feature extraction, significant feature selection and classification into five different domains of erythrocytes as - Normal, Stomatocyte, Poikilocyte, Spherocyte, and Schistocyte in the Leishman stained microscopic blood smear images. Total 51 eminent features of erythrocyte were extracted and the performance of FC-TriSDR gained the highest accuracy of 96.7% with computational time of 1.68 sec. when compared amongst 5 other classic neural networks.},

abstract = {Random-needle embroidery is a kind of traditional Chinese embroidery where artists reproduce the original color image using multilayered intersecting stitches and overlapped deliberately. In other words, artists embroider intersecting stitches layer by layer to depict true color subjects. To create this embroidery art, the major challenge lies on evenly distribution of intersecting stitches to prevent the canvas in embroidery areas from being exposed. Meanwhile, intersecting stitches in each layer should be distributed as evenly as possible so that each layer of intersecting stitch can be quantified as a segment color to synthesize the target segment color. To tackle these challenges, we introduce local texture growth mechanism from example-based discrete element texture synthesis to the application of random-needle embroidery art stylization and propose a new local growth where a uniformity metric is designed to keep intersecting stitches nearly evenly distributed in each layer. In addition, we adopt a color dithering model to specify a color for each layer of monochromatic intersecting stitches at microscopic scale. We apply our method on a rich variety of images, and visually appealing random-needle embroidery images can be obtained in all cases.},

abstract = {Accurate classification of nuclei communities is an important step towards timely treating the cancer spread. Graph theory provides an elegant way to represent and analyze nuclei communities within the histopathological landscape in order to perform tissue phenotyping and tumor profiling tasks. Many researchers have worked on recognizing nuclei regions within the histology images in order to grade cancerous progression. However, due to the high structural similarities between nuclei communities, defining a model that can accurately differentiate between nuclei pathological patterns still needs to be solved. To surmount this challenge, we present a novel approach, dubbed neural graph refinement, that enhances the capabilities of existing models to perform nuclei recognition tasks by employing graph representational learning and broadcasting processes. Based on the physical interaction of the nuclei, we first construct a fully connected graph in which nodes represent nuclei and adjacent nodes are connected to each other via an undirected edge. For each edge and node pair, appearance and geometric features are computed and are then utilized for generating the neural graph embeddings. These embeddings are used for diffusing contextual information to the neighboring nodes, all along a path traversing the whole graph to infer global information over an entire nuclei network and predict pathologically meaningful communities. Through rigorous evaluation of the proposed scheme across four public datasets, we showcase that learning such communities through neural graph refinement produces better results that outperform state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Understanding the microstructure–property relationships of porous media is of great practical significance, based on which macroscopic physical properties can be directly derived from measurable microstructural informatics. However, establishing reliable microstructure–property mappings in an explicit manner is difficult, due to the intricacy, stochasticity, and heterogeneity of porous microstructures. In this paper, a data-driven computational&nbsp;framework is presented to investigate the inherent microstructure–permeability linkage for natural porous rocks, where multiple techniques are integrated together, including microscopy imaging, stochastic reconstruction, microstructural characterization, pore-scale simulation, feature selection, and data-driven modeling. A large number of 3D digital rocks with a wide porosity range are acquired from microscopy imaging and stochastic reconstruction techniques. A broad variety of morphological descriptors are used to quantitatively characterize pore microstructures from different perspectives, and they compose the raw feature pool for feature selection. High-fidelity lattice Boltzmann simulations are conducted to resolve fluid flow passing through porous media, from which reliable permeability references are obtained. The optimal feature set that best represents permeability is identified through a performance-oriented feature selection process, upon which a cost-effective surrogate model is rapidly fitted to approximate the microstructure-permeability mapping via data-driven modeling. This surrogate model exhibits great advantages over empirical/analytical formulas in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization capacity, which can predict reliable permeability values spanning four orders of magnitude. Besides, feature selection also greatly enhances the interpretability of the data-driven prediction model, from which new insights into the mechanism of how microstructural characteristics determine intrinsic permeability are obtained.},

abstract = {In the embryonic human heart, complex dynamic shape changes take place in a short period of time on a microscopic scale, making this development difficult to visualize. However, spatial understanding of these processes is essential for students and future cardiologists to properly diagnose and treat congenital heart defects. Following a user centered approach, the most crucial embryological stages were identified and translated into a virtual reality learning environment (VRLE) to enable the understanding of the morphological transitions of these stages through advanced interactions. To address individual learning types, we implemented different features and evaluated the application regarding usability, perceived task load, and sense of presence in a user study. We also assessed spatial awareness and knowledge gain, and finally obtained feedback from domain experts. Overall, students and professionals rated the application positively. To minimize distraction from interactive learning content, such VRLEs should consider features for different learning types, allow for gradual habituation, and at the same time provide enough playful stimuli. Our work previews how VR can be integrated into a cardiac embryology education curriculum.},

abstract = {On the global level, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is one of the leading malignancies among women undergoing breast cancer screening. A slight delay in detecting and diagnosing this disease may result in irreversible complications. Histopathological images obtained from a biopsy examination present enormous structural information, which helps significantly in improving the prognosis of the disease. Pathological analysis involving microscopic examination of the histopathological slides is a highly challenging task due to the limited abilities of conventional computer-aided detection (CAD) methods to reach a precise diagnosis. The problem has become more accentuated due to the less availability of medical data in the public domain. Lately, deep learning methods using artificial neural networks are being used consistently to improve the performance of these CAD methods. Despite less medical data availability, transfer learning has recently been commonly practised to facilitate a deep neural network to train on a specific dataset in resolving the problem. However, the performance of this method is not remarkably appreciable on small and low-resolution medical image datasets compared to those comprising whole slide images of higher resolutions. In this direction, this study proposes a domain-specific learning strategy, Histo-Fusion, with the objective of detecting the IDC more precisely. In the proposed method, the deep CNN model is initially trained on higher-resolution histopathological images of breast tissue which presents ample information for a model to learn the significant features for better discrimination between normal and malignant tissues. Subsequently, through a positive transfer of domain features, the model is further trained on the small and low-resolution images, enabling it to classify these histology images into IDC - and IDC + categories. Moreover, shallow and deep neural network architectures are utilized in the study to compare their performance across the two learning approaches: transfer learning and Histo-Fusion on the IDC dataset. As revealed by the present study results, the proposed Histo-Fusion learning approach has improved each deep CNN’s discriminating abilities by yielding better accuracy scores of around 5% over and above those obtained by the commonly used transfer learning strategy. Therefore, the procedure is expected to reduce false-positive rates and help expert pathologists reach accurate diagnoses.},

Researchers are constantly being introduced to new and improved methods, and these applications see widespread use for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Early disease detection, efficient drug delivery, cosmetics and health care products, biosensors, miniaturisation techniques, surface improvement in implantable biomaterials, improved nanofibers in medical textiles, etc. are all examples of how biomedical nanotechnology has made a difference in the medical field. The nanoparticles are introduced deliberately for therapeutic purposes or accidentally from the environment; they will eventually reach and penetrate the human body. The exposed nanoparticles interact with human blood, which carries them to various tissues. An essential aspect of blood rheology in the microcirculation is its malleability.As a result, nanomaterial may cause structural abnormalities in erythrocytes. Echinocyte development is a typical example of an induced morphological alteration. The length of time it takes for these side effects to disappear after taking a nano medication also matters. Haemolyses could result from the dangerous concentration. In this experiment, human blood is exposed to varying concentrations of chosen nanomaterial with potential medical applications. The morphological modifications induced were studied by looking at images of erythrocyte cells. That’s a picture of a cell taken using a digital optical microscope, by the way. We used MATLAB, an image-analysis programme, to study the morphometric features. Human lymphocyte cells were used in the cytotoxic analysis.},

abstract = {The accurate prediction of cancer from microscopic biopsy images has always been a major challenge for medical practitioners and pathologists who manually observe the shape and structure of the cells from tissues under a microscope. Mathematical modelling of cell proliferation helps to predict tumour sizes and optimizes the treatment procedure. This paper introduces a cell growth estimation function that uncovers the growth behaviour of benign and malignant cells. To analyse the cellular level information from tissue images, we propose a minimized cellular graph (MCG) development method. The method extracts cells and produces different features that are useful in classifying benign and malignant tissues. The method’s graphical features enable a precise and timely exploration of huge amounts of data and can help in making predictions and informed decisions. This paper introduces an algorithm for constructing a minimized cellular graph which reduces the computational complexity. A comparative study is performed based on the state-of-the-art classifiers, SVM, decision tree, random forest, nearest neighbor, LDA, Naive Bayes, and ANN. The experimental data are obtained from the BreakHis dataset, which contains 2480 benign and 5429 malignant histopathological images. The proposed technique achieves a 97.7% classification accuracy which is 7% higher than that of the other graph feature-based classification methods. A comparative study reveals a performance improvement for breast cancer classification compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Microscopic features (e.g., pore shapes, sizes, and distribution) in porous material substantially affect the overall mechanical properties such as stiffness and strength. In turn, these material properties determine the macroscopic behaviors of fracture in the porous material. In certain cases, macroscopic properties can be derived from the porous skeleton and void ratio (i.e., porosity), but in many other cases, such derivation is a challenging task. This paper presents a numerical investigation of microporosity and micropore shapes effect on the macrofracture behavior in porous amorphous silica. For this study, we extend the recently proposed combined molecular dynamic (MD) and phase-field (PF) fracture modeling approach by including different pore shapes in the atomistic domain. In the MD simulations, we adopt ReaxFF to evaluate the material properties, where four different micropore cases are considered. Based on the material properties derived from MD simulations, the macrofracture propagation of porous media is studied using hybrid PF simulation. In the characterization of the pore structure, the concept of pore ligament is proposed to relate the pore shape and the critical energy release rate. Two classical fracture problems were used to evaluate the effect of micropore shape on the macrofracture behavior. The results of the case studies show that although the micropore shapes change the macrofracture behaviors, these effects vary with the geometry and loading conditions of macroscopic boundary value problems. The case study also shows that the influence of micropore structure can be captured at the macroscopic level through the material properties derived from the MD simulations.},

abstract = {Because of its large specific surface area, small particle size, high surface energy, and unique nanoeffect, the morphological characteristics of nanoparticles are the key factors affecting the properties of materials. How to detect and evaluate the morphological characteristics of nanoparticles is the first problem to be solved in the preparation and application of nanomaterials. The main purpose of this paper is to use TEM to recognize the image features of nanoparticles and introduce the transmission electron microscope and image edge segmentation method and random forest algorithm. A method integrating the in situ characterization of modern electron microscopy and the measurement of the electrical properties of nanomonomers was developed. In this paper, a multielectrode TEM in situ electrical measurement platform is prepared, which improves the contact during the integration of nanomaterials and improves the electrical measurement accuracy of the TEM in situ electrical method. In this paper, based on the random forest algorithm, a multirandom forest algorithm is proposed. Due to the different gray levels of images referenced by the multirandom forest algorithm, the segmentation results are processed by FCM clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that in terms of image segmentation accuracy, the minimum Jaccard coefficient obtained by multiple random forest algorithm is 89% and 95%, respectively, which is obviously better than watershed segmentation method and maximum entropy threshold segmentation. In the aspect of automatic image segmentation of nanoparticles, the image segmentation accuracy is the highest when the sample block size and the number of sample blocks selected in the multiple random forest algorithm are 5∗5, 7500, and 35, respectively. Therefore, the multirandom forest algorithm has achieved high accuracy in image segmentation of nanoparticles, which provides valuable information for the preparation and application of nanomaterials. A new type of TEM dark-field imaging diaphragm was prepared, which greatly improved the imaging quality of weak-phase bulk materials represented by graphene and nonspiral biological samples represented by intracellular polyvesicles.},

Nanocomposites of NiO/SiO2 and NiO-Pr2O3/SiO2 considered much interest due its wide range of applications in medical, engineering, physics, chemistry, and material science. In the present work, synthesizing of NiO/SiO2 and NiO-Pr2O3/SiO2 nanocomposites was carried out using simple and low-cost deposition precipitation technique. Structural features represent that the prepared samples found to be nanocrystalline nature. Surface morphology showed that there is formation of particle with spherical in shape. Transmission electron microscopy supported that the structure of composite with size is in the range of nanometer. The Brauner-Elmer-Teller method showed the surface area of the synthesized nanoparticles. The pore volume present in the nanoparticle was determined by Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the thermal stability of the synthesized nanocomposite is up to 1000°C. The hydrogen enrichment in the producer gas was evident by the tar cracking activity of the synthesized NiO/SiO2 and NiO-Pr2O3/SiO2 nanocomposites.},

abstract = {The image segmentation is an important stage in automatic detection, identification and quantification of various type of parasite eggs in microscopic images. Different types of parasites, such as protozoa, helminths (worms) and ectoparasites and their eggs, can be observed under a microscope in human and animal faeces, blood or urine samples. Microscopic images often contain multiple kinds of parasite eggs as well as other sample impurities or debris. The size, colour, and texture of parasite eggs may also vary in the images depending on the sample collection and image acquisition process, making the segmentation process challenging. Over the years, various segmentation methods such as thresholding, edge detection, wathershed, etc. have been utilised by the researchers in this field. However, to the best of our knowledge, no survey works on the segmentation approaches for parasite eggs in various types of microscopic images have been reported yet. As a result, we explored a number of research reports and prepared a detail review of various segmentation techniques employed in previous works on automatic detection and identification of parasite eggs in different types of microscopic images. The aim of the study is to assist future researchers in identify the suitable strategies for effectively segmenting parasite egg images.},

abstract = {Accurate cell segmentation is a pivotal step throughout the cervical cancer treatment continuum, encompassing early screening, guiding treatment decisions, and assessing long-term prognosis. Currently, in clinical practice, pathologists rely on microscopic examination of cell characteristics followed by manual annotation, leveraging their expert knowledge. Nonetheless, this approach is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to subjectivity. While existing segmentation methods successfully delineate cell clusters, they struggle with single-cell segmentation in overlapping scenarios, often relying on pixel classification methods. This approach tends to produce discontinuous boundaries and incomplete contours. In this paper, we introduce a two-phase framework, Solo_GAN, capable of generating complete boundaries for single cells in overlapping cell clusters and complex backgrounds. In the first phase of our framework, we propose a target detection model based on YOLOv3 for identifying single-cell regions of interest (ROI) in Pap cervical images. In the second stage, the ROIs are fed into a novel network called the dual-domain mapping segmentation network, which is used to generate complete single-cell boundary maps. The process involves conversion between cervical cell images in different states, achieving the generation of single-cell boundaries while retaining the original features of the image. Our method has been extensively evaluated on a Hybrid cervical cell dataset (public and private sets) for its effectiveness. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and proves highly effective. We provide visualizations of the output at each processing stage and compare them with mainstream methodologies. The cell segmentation method proposed in this paper holds considerable significance for clinical research on cells in different stages of cervical cancer.},

abstract = {Classification of histology images has been the focus of plenty researchers in computer vision. Recently, the most common approaches for this task consist of applying deep learning through CNN models. However, there are some limitations to the use of CNN in the context of histological image classification such as the need for large datasets and the difficulty to implement a generalized model able to classify different types of histology tissue. In this work, an ensemble model based on handcrafted fractal features and deep learning that consists of combining the classification of the ResNet-50 model and the classification of local and global handcrafted features by applying the sum rule is proposed. Fractal geometry concepts are used to obtain handcrafted local and global features from different histological datasets. The local features are reshaped into a matrix in order to compose a feature image. Four different reshaping procedures are evaluated, wherein each generates a representation model of fractal features which is given as input to a CNN model. Another CNN architecture receives as input the original image. After associating the results of both CNN models with the classification of the handcrafted local and global features using machine learning approaches, accuracy rates that range from 88.45% up to 99.77% on five datasets were obtained. Moreover, the model was able to classify images from datasets with different resolutions and imbalanced classes with few training epochs. In general, the proposed method is able to provide results that are compatible with the state-of-the-art in histology image classification.},

Optical studies by UV–vis analysis showed a general blue shift in the absorption band edge of the PbS nanoparticles (NPs) with energy bandgaps determined by Tauc’s plots ranging from 2.15 to 3.11 eV. The development of NPs with a variety of morphologies that changed with temperature and precursor type was demonstrated by morphological characterization using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Cubic, rod-shaped, and nearly spherical-shaped PbS were formed. Powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) structural studies revealed the face-centered cubic structure of PbS nanoparticles. The elements contained in the nanoparticles were identified by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). These results suggest that the size, shape, and optical properties of the synthesized PbS NPs were affected by reaction temperature, capping group, and precursor type. Under UV irradiation, the photocatalytic activity of HDA-capped PbS nanoparticles on the degradation of methylene blue dye ranged from 28.3% to 60.0%, with lead sulfide nanoparticle obtained by thermolysis of complex (1) at 230°C showing the highest photocatalytic efficiency (60.0%).},

The TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NW is coated with a gold (Au) thin film (TF) and annealed at a very high temperature. The morphological characteristics have been reported using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis.

abstract = {The attributes of memristors such as their non-volatile nature, simple structure, no leakage current, and fast switching speed present enormous opportunities for various analog and digital applications. It is imperative to develop an accurate physical model of the memristor in order to design digital applications. Hitherto published memristor modeling approaches do not match the practical memristor dynamics. In this work, a new model is developed by considering Schottky contact at the metal–insulator–metal (MIM) interfaces, and a novel memristor is fabricated to validate the proposed model. A bead polymer based on methyl methacrylate and n-butyl methacrylate (MMBM) is first used to explore the resistive switching properties of the device. A cost-effective screen printing technique is demonstrated to deposit the resistive switching layer for the fabrication of the memristor. The resistive switching behavior is observed in the sandwiched layer with a silver (Ag) top electrode and copper (Cu) bottom electrode. The surface morphology and electrical characteristics of the fabricated device are investigated by scanning electron microscopy and two-point probe resistivity measurement. The results confirm the formation of the Schottky barriers at the MIM interfaces of the fabricated device. The proposed model is compared with the device described in this paper having an error of 0.7609 (in terms of the relative root-mean-square error). Moreover, a NOR logic gate is simulated for the circuit simulation of the proposed model. This will pave the way for new digital design applications based on the memristor.},

To address this challenge, we propose a multi-threshold segmentation method for breast cancer images based on an improved Dandelion Optimization algorithm. This approach incorporates the concept of opposite-based learning and utilizes the improved Dandelion Optimization algorithm to calculate the maximum between-class variance as the optimization objective. Moreover, the method establishes fallback strategies and incorporates a memory matrix, while leveraging the golden jackal energy judgment mechanism to identify optimal thresholds. The experimental results show that compared with the Crow search algorithm, Harris Hawks optimization algorithm, artificial gorilla troop optimization algorithm, dandelion optimization algorithm, ocean predator algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, sparrow search algorithm, and sine cosine algorithm, and the improved Dandelion optimization algorithm achieves the highest fitness value and converges at the fastest speed when using the same threshold number, it also occupies an advantageous position in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, feature similarity index, and mean square error.},

abstract = {Histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in cancer diagnosis. It is of significant importance for pathologists to search for images sharing similar content with the query WSI, especially in the case-based diagnosis. While slide-level retrieval could be more intuitive and practical in clinical applications, most methods are designed for patch-level retrieval. A few recently unsupervised slide-level methods only focus on integrating patch features directly, without perceiving slide-level information, and thus severely limits the performance of WSI retrieval. To tackle the issue, we propose a &lt;bold&gt;H&lt;/bold&gt;igh-Order Correlation-Guided &lt;bold&gt;S&lt;/bold&gt;elf-Supervised &lt;bold&gt;H&lt;/bold&gt;ashing-Encoding &lt;bold&gt;R&lt;/bold&gt;etrieval (HSHR) method. Specifically, we train an attention-based hash encoder with slide-level representation in a self-supervised manner, enabling it to generate more representative slide-level hash codes of cluster centers and assign weights for each. These optimized and weighted codes are leveraged to establish a similarity-based hypergraph, in which a hypergraph-guided retrieval module is adopted to explore high-order correlations in the multi-pairwise manifold to conduct WSI retrieval. Extensive experiments on multiple TCGA datasets with over 24,000 WSIs spanning 30 cancer subtypes demonstrate that HSHR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised histology WSI retrieval methods.},

abstract = {One of the most important and vital organs in the human body’s anatomy is the lung. The most prevalent medical disorders in the world today are lung ailments. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have high mortality rates. Lung disorders can be challenging to diagnose in oncology and radiology. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems often highlight worrisome or aberrant patterns, commonly known as “regions of interest”, after receiving inputs from medical imaging modalities including computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The return on investment can be evaluated based on its form, size, pattern of occurrence now, and expected future development. Segmentation in a medical image is difficult because of elements, such as the scanning environment, the quick changes in the strength of the light beams from the scanners, and the variations in noise. Segmenting the lung’s many components gets more difficult as microscopic differences between healthy and diseased lung tissues increase. This necessitates the development of a method for more accurate extraction of the lung model. A model-based segmentation approach was introduced to extract the lung’s shape and link it to a reference model. The suggested model builds sound reference models and compares the shape features to the input slices as a correlation metric. As compared to other frequently used methodologies, the proposed segmentation strategy produced better results, according to a numerical study. It was mathematically compared to other popular segmentation methods including region expanding and flood fill. The proposed method has higher accuracy (98%), specificity (95%), and sensitivity (98%) Precision by 94% than these other methods.},

It provides a level of progression and estimate the aggressiveness of particular diseases. Unfortunately, manual mitosis counting evaluation is a tedious, very labor intensive, and challenging task in analysing grade of a particular cancer. Since breast cancer recurrence and metastasis are intrinsically related to mortality, it is critical to predict the recurrence and metastasis risk of an individual patient, which is essential for adjutant therapy and early intervention. The aim of this study is to propose supervised model to solve the problem of mitosis detection and reduced the time lapse of process compared to the manual counting. We formulate a Low-Rank Matrix Recovery (LRMR) model to find salient regions from microscopy images and extract candidate patch sequences, which potentially contain mitosis cells. Once the patches are segmented, a novel Sparse Patch based Mitosis Handcrafted Feature (SMHCF) are extracted and based on the feature values a eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model are used to classify the mitosis and non-mitosis cells and count of the each cells. Our method is compared with the manual counting values and other state of the art methods. In that performances of our model achieved with better precision is 0.971, recall is 0.960, F1-score is 0.963 rates.},

abstract = {Nuclei segmentation has great significance in biomedical applications as the preliminary step for disease diagnosis and treatment analysis. In this study, we propose a model for automated nuclei identification of varying cell shapes and types from microscopy images. Identifying nuclei helps to understand the underlying mechanism of various diseases in their early stages and provides solutions to enable faster cures. The foremost aim of the study is to develop a lightweight model, capable of segmenting varied shapes and sizes. The proposed architecture exploits multi-scale low-level features following dense high-level feature extraction with multi-feature fusion and special skip connections resulting in enhanced learning capability. The multi-scale feature extractor module extracts low-level information which is further processed using attention-based dense connections to extract semantically meaningful information. The special short-skip residual connections replacing long-skip connections reduced the semantic gap between encoder–decoder features. Moreover, the context encoder module extracts higher-level contextual information of different receptive fields using dilated convolutions making the model robust to different shapes and sizes. The higher-level feature maps propagate upward the decoder connections following the shared attention mechanism of an encoder to decoder features to reconstruct a better segmentation map. Moreover, the evaluation scheme following the proposed test-time augmentation operations improved the mean segmentation performance. The experiments on KDSB18, Synthetic cells, Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MoNuSeg, CryoNuSeg, and BUS datasets demonstrate the suitability of the model for the nuclei segmentation tasks. The DRI-UNet model holds good segmentation performance outperforming baseline architecture by 8.12%, 4.71%, 10.19%, 2.46%, 3.14%, 8.91%, and 9.32% on KDSB18, synthetic cells, TNBC, MoNuSeg, CryoNuSeg, CVC-ClinicDB, and BUS datasets, respectively. We further conducted generalization tests of the proposed model for cross-dataset validation, and two independent MIS datasets confirm model effectiveness for nuclei cell and biomedical image segmentation.},

The project estimated the generated light current at a certain latitude (Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur) with temperatures and insolation variations through the time of year. Modelling and analysis help to understand the characteristics and behaviour of the present PV generator under lab conditions as well as in the real climate of that location. The results also showed that the power obtained is enhanced under higher incident light intensity, whereas it drops while increasing the PV cell temperature. Moreover, the results included parasitic resistors, which have different impact on the output power. The power conversion efficiency is ideal with the highest shunt resistance and inversely proportional to the series resistance. The PV cell was tested by a solar simulator and the experimental results were compared to the simulation measurements and manufacturer specifications of the PV cell. In addition, the PV cell was inspected by scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) for morphological characterization and elemental composition of the thin film solar cell.},

abstract = {The determination and categorization of red blood cells (RBCs) from microscopic pictures is a critical step in the diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD). Traditionally, such procedures are performed manually by pathologists using a light microscope. Furthermore, manual visual evaluation is a time-consuming operation that relies on subjective judgment, resulting in variations in RBC recognition and counts. Mature If there is a blood problem, RBCs suffer morphological alterations. There are both automated and manual systems available on the market for counting the number of RBCs. Manual counting entails collecting blood cells with a Hemocytometer. The traditional procedure of exposing the smear below a microscope and physically measuring the cells yields inaccurate findings, putting clinical laboratory staff under stress. Automatic counters are incapable of detecting aberrant cell. The computer-aided method will assist in achieving accurate outcomes in minimum time. In this study presents an image processing method for separating red blood cells from several other blood products. Its goal is to analyze and interpret blood smear images to aid in the categorizing of red blood cells across 11 categories. The WBCs are extracted from the image using the K-Medoids technique, that is resistant to exterior disturbance. Granulometric assessment has been used to distinguish between red and WBCs. Feature extraction is used to obtain important features that aid in categorization. The categorization outcomes aid in a rapid diagnosis of disorders such as Normochromic, Iron Deficiency, Hypochromic, Sickle Cell, and Megaloblastic.},

abstract = {Despite several attempts to enhance the electrical and charge carrier transport characteristics of porous silicon (PSi), the requisite conditions for optimally synthesizing n-PSi with appealing optoelectronic properties are yet to be achieved. Therefore, this research explores the effect of the chemical ratio of precursor materials (HF:C2H6O:H2O2) on the surface morphology, crystalline structure, and optical and electric properties of PSi. The PSi was produced by photoelectrochemical etching followed by anodization of the n-type Si under light illumination. The properties of the as-prepared PSi were studied by means of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The HF:C2H6O:H2O2 chemical ratio was optimized at 2 : 1 : 1. A metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) ultraviolet photodetector (Pt/n-PSi/Pt) was fabricated, which exhibited high performances under UV light (365 nm) illumination. The photodetector was shown to be highly stable and reliable with a rapid rise time of 0.56 s at a bias voltage of +5 V. The MSM photodetector displayed responsivity (Rp) of 9.17 A/m at 365 nm, which significantly exceeds the values reported for TiC/porous Si/Si in some contemporary research. The photodetector fabricated from n-PSi, synthesized at an optimum chemical ratio (2 : 1 : 1) exhibited the best photodetection performance, possibly due to the high porosity and defect-free state of the n-PSi thin films.},

abstract = {LED is an extremely important energy-saving lighting products, which has greatly facilitated human life. Meanwhile, it also makes a positive contribution to global carbon neutrality and carbon peaking. Defect detection is a vital part of the production process to control the quality of LED chips. The traditional methods use a microscope for manual visual inspection, which is time-consuming and has inconsistent testing standards, low efficiency, and other deficiencies. To solve these problems, a hybrid algorithm based on geometric computation and a convolutional neural network is proposed for LED chip defect detection. The method takes advantage of the dimensionality reduction of geometric computation to perform coarse detection of defects on preprocessed chip lithography graphs in the form of grid segmentation, which realizes fast coarse screening of large-scale chip samples and reduces postcomputational costs. The convolutional neural network model is used for the secondary fine detection of “suspected defective” chips after geometric coarse screening, and the SPP (spatial pyramid pooling) network model is improved by directly introducing the original feature map into the SPP pooling layer for summation to enhance the global and local feature information of the output feature map. Furthermore, we construct an LED chip image acquisition platform using a high-frequency multimagnification zoom lens, collect training samples of defective chips, and increase the number of samples through image processing techniques. The research introduces the R-CNN, SDD, and YOLO methods to evaluate the superiority of our method in a number of experiments. The experimental results show that our algorithm proposed in this paper has an average precision (AP) of 96.7% for large-scale chip detection with a low defect rate. Compared with other methods, the testing mean average precision (mAP) is 10.39% higher than traditional YOLO v2. The testing mIoU is also 3.63% higher than traditional YOLO v5, the detection speed is also significantly improved, and it has good robustness.},

abstract = {Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were prepared by the sol–gel method and the structural, morphological, and optical properties were investigated at different sintering temperatures of 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900°C. A tetragonal structure of anatase, mixed (anatase–rutile), and rutile phases are observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Pure anatase phase formation occurred at 500°C, whereas anatase-to-rutile phase transformation began at 600°C, and reaching complete conversion to rutile at 800°C. The average crystallite size increased from 23 to 34 nm for anatase and 38 to 62 nm for the rutile when sintering temperature increased from 500 to 900°C. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) result presented the increase of grain size (25–100 nm) with increasing the sintering temperature. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra demonstrated the presence of TiO2 vibrational bonds in all samples. The optical bandgaps of the sintered TiO2 nanoparticles decreased with rising sintering temperature. Photoluminescence spectra exhibited three characteristic peaks centered at 380, 450, and 550 nm. The emission intensity increased with increasing the sintering temperature. The Mie analysis was also studied to calculate scattering cross-section, forward scattering, and asymmetry for different grain sizes. The results showed that by increasing the nanoparticle diameters, the peaks of all spectra are redshifted for larger grain sizes and cross-section peaks shift to high values. In this study, the sintering temperature is observed to have a strong influence on crystalline phase transformation, microstructure, and optical properties of TiO2 nanoparticles. The TiO2 sample sintered at 900°C shows the best result to be used as luminescent material due to the low optical bandgap energy.},

abstract = {This paper considers the design of structures made of engineered materials, accounting for uncertainty in material properties. We present a topology optimization approach that optimizes the structural shape and topology at the macroscale assuming design-independent uncertain microstructures. The structural geometry at the macroscale is described by an explicit level set approach, and the macroscopic structural response is predicted by the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). We describe the microscopic layout by either an analytic geometric model with uncertain parameters or a level-cut from a Gaussian random field. The macroscale properties of the microstructured material are predicted by homogenization. Considering the large number of possible microscale configurations, one of the main challenges of solving such topology optimization problems is the computational cost of estimating the statistical moments of the cost and constraint functions and their gradients with respect to the design variables. Methods for predicting these moments, such as Monte Carlo sampling, and Taylor series and polynomial chaos expansions often require a large number of random samples resulting in an impractical computation. To reduce this cost, we propose an approach wherein, at every design iteration, we only use a small number of microstructure configurations to generate an independent, stochastic approximation of the gradients. These gradients are then used either with a gradient descent algorithm, namely Adaptive Moment (Adam), or the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA). Three numerical examples from structural mechanics are used to show that the proposed approach provides a computationally efficient way for macroscale topology optimization in the presence of microstructural uncertainty and enables the designers to consider a new class of problems that are out of reach today with conventional tools.},

abstract = {Breast histopathological image analysis at 400x magnification is essential for the determination of malignant breast tumours. But manual analysis of these images is tedious, subjective, error-prone and requires domain knowledge. To this end, computer-aided tools are gaining much attention in the recent past as it aids pathologists and save time. Furthermore, advances in computational power have leveraged the usage of computer tools. Yet, usage of computer-aided tools to analyse these images is challenging due to various reasons such as heterogeneity of malignant tumours, colour variations and presence of artefacts. Moreover, these images are captured at high resolutions which pose a major challenge to designing deep learning models as it demands high computational requirements. In this context, the present work proposes a new approach to efficiently and effectively extract features from these high-resolution images. In addition, at 400x magnification, the characteristics and structure of nuclei play a prominent role in the decision of malignancy. In this regard, the study introduces a novel CNN architecture called as CWA-Net that uses a colour channel attention module to enhance the features of the potential regions of interest such as nuclei. The developed model is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated on private and public datasets and achieved an accuracy of 0.95% and 0.96%, respectively. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both datasets.},

abstract = {The discrete element method (DEM) is the most dominant method for the numerical prediction of dynamic behaviour at grain or particle scale. Nevertheless, due to its discontinuous nature, the DEM is inherently unable to describe microscopic features of individual bodies which can be considered as continuous bodies. To incorporate microscopic features, efficient numerical coupling of the DEM with a continuous method is generally necessary. Thus, a generalised multi-scale PD–DEM framework is developed in this work. In the developed framework, meshfree discretised Peridynamics (PD) is used to describe intra-particle forces within bodies to capture microscopic features. The inter-particle forces of rigid bodies are defined by the DEM whereas a hybrid approach is applied at the PD–DEM interface. In addition, a staggered multi-scale time integration scheme is formulated to allow for an efficient numerical treatment of both methods. Validation examples are presented and the applicability of the developed framework to capture the characteristics mixtures with rigid and deformable bodies is shown.},

abstract = {The processing quality of the grooves of a nuclear-fuel rod will directly affect the quality of the finished nuclear-fuel rod. Due to the highly reflective, microscopic, and annular characteristics of nuclear-fuel rod grooves, it has been quite challenging to realize imaging and microscopic defect detection for these grooves. In this work, a machine vision-based defect detection system was developed for nuclear-fuel rod grooves. Through the performance improvement and application of the self-reference template defect detection method, efficient online inspection of nuclear-fuel rod grooves was realized. In the developed system, a combined-light-source imaging system was first designed by combining a coaxial light and a ring light, which realized the clear imaging of a groove. After that, an image expansion strategy was employed to expand the annular groove into a strip-shaped region of interest (ROI). Then, according to the turning processing characteristic of the nuclear-fuel rod groove, the large-size defect detection effect of the self-reference template method was improved by eliminating the anomalous columns prior to generating the self-reference template. The experimental results indicated that the average inspection efficiency of the developed system was 8.026&nbsp;s/rod, the average false detection rate was 0.183%. The accuracy of the self-reference template method was 87.6%, higher than that of YOLOv2 and Faster R-CNN. The developed system exhibits high inspection efficiency and accuracy, so it can meet the actual detection functions and requirements of production lines, and now it has been successfully applied to actual production.},

abstract = {Histopathology imaging is one of the key methods used to determine the presence of cancerous cells. However, determining the results from such medical images is a tedious task because of their size, which may cause a delay in results for days. Even though CNNs are widely used to analyze medical images, they can only learn short-term dependency and ignore long-term dependency, which could be crucial in processing higher dimensional histology images. Transformers, however, make use of a self-attention mechanism, which might be helpful to learn dependencies across an entire set of features. To process histology images, deep learning models require a large number of images, which is usually not available. Transfer learning, which is often used to deal with this issue, involves fine-tuning a trained model for use with medical images by adding features. In context, it is essential to analyze which CNNs or transformers are more conducive to transfer learning. In this study, we performed an empirical study to evaluate the performance of different pre-trained deep learning models for the classification of lung and colon cancer on histology images. Vision transformer and CNN models pre-trained on image-net are analyzed for the classification of histopathology images. We performed an experiment on the LC25000 dataset for the evaluation of models. The dataset consists of five classes, two belong to colon and three belong to lung cancer. The insights and observations obtained from an ablation study performed on different pre-trained models show vision transformers perform better than CNN based models for histopathology image classification using transfer learning. Moreover, the vision transformer with more layers of ViT-L32 performs better than ViTB32 with fewer layers.},

We aimed at realizing a vibration sensor with wideband response in a low-frequency vibration domain, owing to the high-power density of vibration sources energy normally in a particular low frequency with several hertz deviations. A special design was implemented in this work, for the first time, to realize the sensor structure with a wideband response function. The given sensor has a disk-shaped proof mass attached to three sandwiched AlN spring flexures and a supporting beam system. Using MEMS techniques, the sensors were fabricated with the single die size of 7 \texttimes{} 7&nbsp;mm and observed via scanning electron microscopy comprehensively. The functional feature of the electrical performance of the sensors was evaluated. The results demonstrated that with the given sensor, which has a low center resonant frequency of 57.5&nbsp;Hz with a response feature of a half-voltage bandwidth of &gt; 10&nbsp;Hz, an output voltage of 2.4–4&nbsp;mV at an acceleration of 0.1–0.6&nbsp;g can be typically achieved. The low-frequency vibration sensor with a wideband response function can be used for many industrial and civilian applications to eliminate the restrictions on power sources.},

The influence of the number of unit cells within the representative volume element (RVE), thus, the RVE’s size on the homogenized mechanical response is studied for occurring microscopic structural instabilities. Therein, the macro-scale, described in terms of three-dimensional continuum mechanics, is coupled to the micro-scale described by geometrically exact rods, enabling arbitrary large deformations and rotations. A special feature of the presented framework is that the rods building the lattice structures are not restricted to deform purely elastically but may deform inelastically. The mechanical response of lattice structures is investigated by applying the developed homogenization method to an exemplary lattice. Under special loads the structure reaches an instable state and may buckle. The appearance of instabilities depends on the geometric properties of the lattice’s underlying rods and the RVE’s size.},

abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) is an imperative genomic model organism that is employed widely in healthcare and biological research works. Roughly 61% of recognized human genes have a perceptible similarity with the genetic code of D. melanogaster flies, besides 50% of its protein structures have mammalian equivalents. In recent times, numerous studies have been done in D. melanogaster to investigate the functions of particular genes that are available in its central nervous system, including the major organs like the heart, liver and kidney. The findings of these research works through D. melanogaster are utilized as a key mechanism to explore human interrelated diseases. However, it is essential to recognize the male and female Drosophila flies for the better understanding of human disease related studies, and it is a tricky job. This paper describes a unique programmed system to categorize the gender of D. melanogaster from the ventral view portraits captured through microscope. The proposed method includes image segmentation of the body of D. melanogaster in the form of a binary image and the construction of a continuous morphological model based on its skeleton. An analysis of the skeleton makes it possible to assess the sharpness of the caudal end of the D. melanogaster abdomen through a detailed assessment of the curvature. Based on this assessment, a Drosophila melanogaster Gender (DMG) classifier is constructed for the gender determination of D. melanogaster flies. The accuracy of the DMG classifier is about 98% in proportion to the existing state-of-the-art shape-based classifiers with optimal computing time.},

abstract = {Leukemia (blood cancer) is an unusual spread of White Blood Cells or Leukocytes (WBCs) in the bone marrow and blood. Pathologists can diagnose leukemia by looking at a person’s blood sample under a microscope. They identify and categorize leukemia by counting various blood cells and morphological features. This technique is time-consuming for the prediction of leukemia. The pathologist’s professional skills and experiences may be affecting this procedure, too. In computer vision, traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques are practical roadmaps that increase the accuracy and speed in diagnosing and classifying medical images such as microscopic blood cells. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the detection and classification of acute leukemia and WBCs in the microscopic blood cells. First, we have divided the previous works into six categories based on the output of the models. Then, we describe various steps of detection and classification of acute leukemia and WBCs, including Data Augmentation, Preprocessing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction, Feature Selection (Reduction), Classification, and focus on classification step in the methods. Finally, we divide automated detection and classification of acute leukemia and WBCs into three categories, including traditional, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and mixture (traditional and DNN) methods based on the type of classifier in the classification step and analyze them. The results of this study show that in the diagnosis and classification of acute leukemia and WBCs, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in traditional machine learning models and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier in deep learning models have widely employed. The performance metrics of the models that use these classifiers compared to the others model are higher. We propose providing models in detecting and classify acute leukemia and WBCs that use a combination of SVM and CNN classifiers in their classification step to achieve optimum performance metrics.},

The size, shape, morphology, and stability of resultant CuNPs were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive spectrophotometer. Crude extracts were assessed phytochemically to determine the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, steroids, and tannins. The UV-Vis absorption spectra show maximum absorption at 330 nm, and FTIR showed the presence of biological molecules responsible for reducing Cu+ ions. In TEM and EDS analyses, the average diameter of the synthesized NPs was found to be 6.28±1.13 nm. The crystal structure of synthesized nanoparticle was determined using XRD analysis and showed its peak at 36.34°, 43.33°, 50.47°, and 73.57°, which corresponds to the cubic lattice of copper. The synthesized nanoparticles (NPs) were tested for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against bacterial strains E. coli and S. aureus by the agar well diffusion method which showed higher efficiency against S. aureus. The antioxidant activity of the synthesized NPs was evaluated by DPPH assay, and the percentage of inhibition was found to be 62% at the concentration of 400 μg/ml and the IC50 value was 51.53 μg/ml. The present investigation suggests that the biosynthesized CuNPs showed prominent antibacterial and free radical scavenging potential. The result proved that root extract of W. somnifera could be applied for synthesis of nanoparticle CuNPs with high uniform particle size along with potent biological activity.},

R. stricta possesses multimedical applications and used for curing of various diseases such as inflammation, diabetes, sore throat, infectious, helminthiasis, arthritis, and cancer. The current investigation deals with synthesizing AgNPs using aqueous and ethanol extracts of R. stricta. The synthesized R. stricta-AgNPs were characterized through UV-visible, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. The UV-visible analysis exhibited a characteristic absorption λmax at 475 nm in R. stricta ethanol AgNPs while this peak was absent in R. stricta aqueous crude extract. The thermal stability of R. stricta-AgNPs demonstrated that by increasing the reduction time and temperature, the absorption of AgNPs also increased, leading to more stable NPs formation. The FTIR spectra showed a broad peak at 450-550 cm-1 that confirmed the occurrence of AgNPs of R. stricta. The AFM study of the synthesized AgNPs revealed the spherical shape and size ranging from 30 nm to 90 nm. In antioxidant and antibacterial study, the R. stricta-AgNPs exhibited good antioxidant activity (87.94% and 88.37%) than the ethanol crude extract (50.00% and 56.81%) at 100 μg/mL using DPPH assay. Maximum antibacterial activity was recorded against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), which was 15 and 0 mm, while against Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumonia) was found to be 16 and 14 mm, respectively, whereas against Bacillus subtills, a poor activity was recorded as 14 for extract and 0 mm for AgNPs, respectively. In the acetic acid-induced writhing model, the percent effect of extract (100 mg/kg) and AgNPs (15 mg/kg) was 79.98 and 83.23, respectively. The maximum muscle coordination effect of extracts in the inclined plan and traction test was 44% and 38% at higher doses. A mild sedative effect was also recorded against extract and AgNPs. The significant (p&lt;0.05) effect of extract was noted at 100 mg/kg while AgNPs was more significant (p&lt;0.01) at the tested dose of 15 mg/kg. These findings have concluded that R. stricta-AgNPs is an effective bioreductant of AgNPs synthesis and exhibit several applications in distinctive biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is an important factor affecting human health. This issue has various diagnosis process which were evolved such as mammography, fine needle aspirate, and surgical biopsy. These techniques use pathological breast cancer images for diagnosis. Breast cancer surgery allows the forensic doctor to histologist to access the microscopic level of breast tissues. The conventional method uses an optimized radial basis neural network using a cuckoo search algorithm. Existing radial basis neural network techniques utilized feature extraction and reduction parts separately. It is proposed that it overcomes the CNN approach for all the feature extraction and classification process to reduce time complexity. In this proposed method, a convolutional neural network is proposed based on an artificial fish school algorithm. The breast cancer image dataset is taken from cancer imaging archives. In the preprocessing step of classification, the breast cancer image is filtered with the support of a wiener filter for classification. The convolutional neural network has set the intense data of an image and is used to remove the features. After executing the extraction procedure, the reduction process is performed to speed up the train and test data processing. Here, the artificial fish school optimization algorithm is utilized to give the direct training data to the deep convolutional neural network. The extraction, reduction, and classification of features are utilized in the single deep convolutional neural network process. In this process, the optimization technique helps to decrease the error rate and increases the performance efficiency by finding the number of epochs and training images to the Deep CNN. In this system, the normal, benign, and malignant tissues are predicted. By comparing the existing RBF technique with the cuckoo search algorithm, the presented model attains the outcome in the way of sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, F1 score, and recall.},

abstract = {Human health is threatened worldwide by microbial infections. Antibiotic overuse and misuse have resulted in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. To battle such resistant microbes, we are looking for safe and alternative antimicrobial treatments, and the advent of nanotechnology holds promise in this regard. Metal oxide nanoparticles have emerged as a promising alternative source for combating bacteria resistant to various antibiotics over the last two decades. Due to their diverse physicochemical characteristics, metal oxide nanoparticles can operate as antibacterial agents through various methods. In the present research, six types of metal oxide NPs were synthesized and characterized (XRD, FTIR, SEM with EDAX, and TEM) from different plants such as Hydrangea paniculata (for NiO NP synthesis), Plectranthus amboinicus (for ZnO-NP synthesis), and Andrographis paniculata (V2O5 NPs). On the other hand, drug-resistant pathogens were isolated from clinical samples, those who suffered from foodborne illness. V2O5 NPs produced from Andrographis paniculata plant extract have much higher bactericidal efficacy than other metal oxide NPs against all three bacterial strains. Sensitive bacteria included S. aureus and E. coli, followed by K. pneumoniae. As a result, structural characterization was used to further screen V2O5 NPs. The orthorhombic structure of the crystallites was confirmed by XRD, with an average crystallite size of 20 nm. The absorbance spectrum and functional groups were identified using UV-visible spectral analysis and FTIR. SEM and EDX identified spherical-shaped NPs, and particle size (58 nm) was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As a result, we hypothesized that bioinspired V2O5-NPs could be employed as a possible antibacterial agent against drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria to replace currently existing inefficient antibacterial drugs.},

In this study, glycine–histidine–lysine (GHK) peptide as a skin repair accelerator was coupled to L-carnitine with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties to investigate its new wound healing properties in a nanoparticle (NP) platform. The conjugate was synthesized by solid-phase synthesis method with Fmoc chemistry, purified by preparative HPLC, and was identified with ESI-Mass technique. The conjugate was then loaded into PLGA NPs, which was prepared using solvent evaporation technique. Zetasizer results showed a mean size and zeta potential of 193.15 nm and −30.2 ± 3.8 mV for the conjugate-loaded PLGA NPs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) exhibited spherical-shaped morphology for the NPs with uniform size distribution (PDI = 0.265). Conjugate release from the NPs was about 10% at initial time, which increased to more than about 70% at 200 hr, exhibiting a sustained release trend. Additionally, the treatment of fibroblasts with the nanoconjugate indicated its biocompatibility. Compared to GHK, L-carnitine and free conjugates, the most satisfactory wound healing activity was observed for conjugate-loaded NPs upon wound closure in a rat model of skin injury repair. Furthermore, more epithelialization and neovascularization were observed for L-carnitine–GHK nanoconjugate. Taken together, the L-carnitine–GHK conjugate-loaded PLGA NP will be a promising candidate for wound healing management.},

The experimental work plan to execute with the three different proportional composites was as follows: bamboo fiber mat constant loading for all the specimens, but the filler particle ratio will be varied, prominently rice husk particle concentrated for all the three specimens: 5%, 10%, and 15%, and additionally, MWCNT drawn two specific specimens (2 and 3): 0.5% and 1% based on the fiber/filler concentration balanced the epoxy resin. The research presented here is hybrid nanocomposite experimented with thermal, mechanical, and morphological characterization. Thermal conductivity measured by Lee’s disc method is observed at 0.2577 W/mK for specimen 3. The tensile and flexural properties are higher for 0.5% MWCNT concentration (specimen 2): 42.66 MPa and 54.72 MPa, respectively. The maximum impact strength is reached at 1% MWCNT concentration (specimen 3). Bamboo fiber and rice husk filler matrix composite (specimen 1) reached extremities shore-D hardness 84. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to examine the morphological characteristics of the tensile fractography specimen and analyzed the dispersion of the fiber/filler matrix adhesion of the surface. The bamboo fiber mat/rice husk/MWCNT (specimen 3) filler had better binding and observed fewer fiber pull-out, fiber fracture, fiber extension, and voids. In the graphic comparison, 0.5% MWCNT achieved more mechanical properties than the other two combinations.},

The extract of plant used in the silver nanoparticle synthesis served as a stabilizing and reducing agent. The silver nanoparticles were characterized via various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and UV-visible spectroscopy. The FT-IR analysis showed an identification of functional groups of biomolecules present in plant extract like O-H stretching of phenolic compounds and the C-H stretch of alkanes, C=O is stretching vibration of carbonyl, C-N is stretching of amines and amides, and the C-O is stretching of ester that facilitates the formation of Ag-NPs. The spherical geometry and crystalline morphology with an average crystal size of 15-28 nm of Ag-NPs were revealed using SEM and XRD analysis, respectively. The stability of Ag-NPs was checked through changing the pH and temperature of the reaction mixture. It was examined that synthesized Ag-NPs were stable at 60°C temperatures and nearly neutral pH 8. The synthesized Ag-NPs also exhibit potential antibacterial activity that were investigated against a selected bacterial pathogens, like E. aerogens, B. bronchiseptica, and S. typhimurium. The silver nanoparticles exhibited a maximum zone of inhibition of 18.1±1.73 mm, 14.3±1.18 mm, and 19.5±1.30 mm against E. aerogens, B. bronchiseptica, S. typhimurium, respectively.

The morphological features of flocs (microbial aggregates) and filaments are related to the state of an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant and must be monitored for proper functioning. Hence, image processing and analysis could be a time-saving monitoring tool. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework involving a multiphase edge detection algorithm based on information theory. The proposed framework is evaluated and scrutinized critically considering the artifacts found in the photographs tested. To evaluate the segmentations, gold approximation of estimated truth images is created. In addition, the performance was subjectively evaluated for its potential for segmenting activated sludge images. Experimental results show that the proposed framework exhibits the good results and demonstrates its effectiveness.},

Nanoparticles are studied extensively for their specific catalytic, magnetic, electronic, optical, antimicrobial, theranostic, diagnosis, wound healing, and anti-inflammatory properties. ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) have many applications owing to their unique characteristics, which include low cost, nontoxicity, abundance in nature, and the ability to prepare compounds with varying morphologies having different properties. The main aim of the study is to biosynthesis of ZnO nanoparticles coated with silver from the aqueous extract of Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P. Karst and to evaluate its antidiabetic potential by performing alpha-glucosidase inhibition and alpha-amylase inhibition assays and to evaluate the anticancer potential by cytotoxicity (MTT) assay against human breast cancer MDA-MB 231 cell lines. The biosynthesis of ZnO nanoparticles coated with Ag was characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscopy. An increasing concentration in the biosynthesized ZnO nanoparticles coated with Ag produces strong antidiabetic activity through enzyme inhibition effect and anticancer activity through the reduction of cell viability. The present study recommended that the “Biological” method of biological nanoparticle production is a promising approach that allows synthesis in aqueous conditions, with low energy requirements and low costs. In the future, the mycosynthesized nanoparticles might be used in the medical arena to treat and prevent diseases.},

abstract = {Inspection of tissues using a light microscope is the primary method of diagnosing many diseases, notably cancer. Highly multiplexed tissue imaging builds on this foundation, enabling the collection of up to 60 channels of molecular information plus cell and tissue morphology using antibody staining. This provides unique insight into disease biology and promises to help with the design of patient-specific therapies. However, a substantial gap remains with respect to visualizing the resulting multivariate image data and effectively supporting pathology workflows in digital environments on screen. We, therefore, developed Scope2Screen, a scalable software system for focus+context exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. Our approach scales to analyzing 100GB images of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; or more pixels per channel, containing millions of individual cells. A multidisciplinary team of visualization experts, microscopists, and pathologists identified key image exploration and annotation tasks involving finding, magnifying, quantifying, and organizing regions of interest (ROIs) in an intuitive and cohesive manner. Building on a scope-to-screen metaphor, we present interactive lensing techniques that operate at single-cell and tissue levels. Lenses are equipped with task-specific functionality and descriptive statistics, making it possible to analyze image features, cell types, and spatial arrangements (neighborhoods) across image channels and scales. A fast sliding-window search guides users to regions similar to those under the lens; these regions can be analyzed and considered either separately or as part of a larger image collection. A novel snapshot method enables linked lens configurations and image statistics to be saved, restored, and shared with these regions. We validate our designs with domain experts and apply Scope2Screen in two case studies involving lung and colorectal cancers to discover cancer-relevant image features.},

abstract = {The application of machine learning methods to analyze histological images has led to significant advances in computer-aided diagnosis. In this work, a study was carried out to classify patterns present in histological samples stained with hematoxylin-eosin, representative of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, liver tissue, and oral dysplasia. The proposed method explored convolutional neural networks (VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNet B2), gradient-weighted class activation mapping, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and representations based on the inceptionism effect (DeepDream). The deep features were analyzed via multiple classifiers (rotation forest, multilayer perceptron, logistic, random forest, decorate, k-nearest neighbor, KStar, and support vector machine) to indicate the main associations. The best solution was obtained through the ResNet50 model with the representations from the VGG19 architecture, exploring feature vectors with 40 and 100 attributes. The results were AUC rates ranging from 0.994 (breast cancer dataset) to 1.0 (colorectal dataset). The most explored deep features were obtained via original images (highest occurrence), followed by local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, DeepDream, and gradient-weighted class activation mapping representations. These results can support the development of techniques addressed to pattern recognition of H &amp;E images with more robust computer-aided diagnoses.},

abstract = {A method for non-destructively measuring the pressure inside the sealed cavity of a wafer-bonded capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) using an atomic force microscope (AFM) has been presented. The AFM measurements were performed using the dynamic mode (tapping mode) operation of an AFM to obtain the maximum deflection of the CMUT diaphragm center. This data was then post-processed using both finite element and analytical methods to determine the pressure inside the sealed CMUT cavity. The CMUT geometry was fabricated with a 1.63&nbsp;μm thick, 28&nbsp;μm sidelength metalized square polymer diaphragm, which is separated from a silicon backplate by a 0.75&nbsp;μm thick vacuum cavity. The pressure inside the CMUT cavity was measured to be 836.82&nbsp;kPa higher than the atmospheric pressure. The 3D finite element analysis predicted a maximum deflection of 227.2472&nbsp;nm at the center of the diaphragm, caused by a measured pressure of 836.82&nbsp;kPa. This result deviates by only 0.55% from the maximum deflection of 226&nbsp;nm measured by AFM at the center of the diaphragm. The deviation is 6.19% from the mean deflection of 214&nbsp;nm measured by AFM. `This method can be used to evaluate the vacuum quality inside a CMUT cavity to characterize the bonding process and measure the residual stress in a laminated diaphragm. This method can also be used to characterize any outgassing from the structural materials of a CMUT for the purpose of estimating its lifetime, or calibrating its operational condition as it ages, in order to enhance its reliability. Additionally, the method can be extended to measure the vacuum quality and outgassing of other types of micro-sized vacuum enclosures for their estimating their lifetime.},

abstract = {Color variations in H&amp;E histological images can impact the segmentation and classification stages of computational systems used for cancer diagnosis. To address these variations, normalization techniques can be applied to adjust the colors of histological images. Estimates of stain color appearance matrices and stain density maps can be employed to carry out these color adjustments. This study explores these estimates by leveraging a significant biological characteristic of stain mixtures, which is represented by a sparsity parameter. Computationally estimating this parameter can be accomplished through various sparsity measures and evolutionary algorithms. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different sparsity measures and algorithms for color normalization of H&amp;E-stained histological images. The results obtained demonstrated that the choice of different sparsity measures significantly impacts the outcomes of normalization. The sparsity metric lϵ0 proved to be the most suitable for it. Conversely, the evolutionary algorithms showed little variations in the conducted quantitative analyses. Regarding the selection of the best evolutionary algorithm, the results indicated that particle swarm optimization with a population size of 250 individuals is the most appropriate choice.},

abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer amongst women that threatens the health of women, initial diagnosis of BC becomes essential. Though there were several means to diagnose BC, the standard way is pathological analysis. Precise diagnosis of BC necessitates experienced histopathologists and needs more effort and time for completing this task. Recently, machine learning (ML) was successfully implemented in text classification, image recognition, and object recognition. With the emergence of computer aided diagnoses (CAD) technology, ML was effectively implemented for BC diagnosis. Histopathological image classification depends on deep learning (DL), particularly convolution neural network (CNN), which frequently needs a large amount of labelled training models, whereas the labelled data was hard to obtain. This study develops an Aquila Optimizer(AO) with Hybrid ResNet-DenseNet Enabled Breast Cancer Classification on Histopathological Images (AOHRD-BC2HI). The proposed AOHRD-BC2HI technique inspects the histopathological images for the diagnosis of breast cancer. To accomplish this, the presented AOHRD-BC2HI technique uses hybridization of Resnet with Densenet (HRD) model for feature extraction. Moreover, the HRD method can be enforced for feature extracting procedure in which the DenseNet (feature value memory by concatenation) and ResNet (refinement of feature value by addition) were interpreted. For BC detection and classification, the DSAE model is utilized. The AO algorithm is exploited to improve the detection performance of DSAE model. The experimental validation of the presented AOHRD-BC2HI approach is tested using benchmark dataset and the results are investigated under distinct measures.Also the proposed model achieved the accuracy of 96%. The comparative result reports the improved performance of the presented AOHRD-BC2HI technique over other recent methods.},

abstract = {A computer simulation of road traffic is a commonly used tool, which can help to manage constantly intensifying road traffic. It can help to analyze behavior of existing road traffic networks or to predict the behavior of new designed road traffic structures. There are several existing simulators designed or adapted to run in a distributed computing environment in order to achieve a faster execution. In this environment, the inter-process communication ensured by a high-level communication protocol is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the speed of the entire computation. Various high-level communication protocols can have various efficiency, applicability, and scalability. This paper describes an improved methodology for testing and assessment of high-level communication protocols for micro-scale (or microscopic) distributed road traffic simulations. The methodology investigates the dependencies of the communication protocols’ performance on various features of the simulation and enables to easily calculate score for each of the tested protocols. Using the scores, the tested protocols can be directly compared. This can be useful when designing or improving a distributed road traffic simulation as the best protocol can be used in this simulation to improve its performance (e.g., its speedup or communication time). The improved version of the methodology is an evolution of its original version. It newly incorporates the assessment of the error introduced into the simulation by lossy communication protocols and reduces overall number of performed tests. The improved methodology was tested using a case study assessing several communication protocols of our own design.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. The Gleason score, determined by pathologists through microscopic examination of pathological tissue, is the most powerful prognostic indicator for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. However, there is inter- and intra-observer variability among pathologists, and the scoring process imposes a significant workload on them. This study presents a deep learning model that utilizes gigapixel pathology images and slide-level labels for prostate cancer detection and Gleason grading. WSIs are first cropped into small patches, and a deep learning model trained using self-supervised learning is used to extract features from the patches. An attention-LSTM is then used to aggregate features and perform the final classification. Our pipeline for Gleason grading, which utilizes a 6-level classification system, achieves a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.930 on the internal test dataset (n = 531). Furthermore, it demonstrates good generalization on the external test dataset (n = 155) with a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.8668. The proposed model integrating a self-supervised feature extraction model and an attention LSTM aggregator, is one of the most advanced scoring methods for grading prostate cancer using only slide-level labels. It represents a significant advancement in automating the extraction of prostate cancer grading information in digital diagnostic pathology and will help to address the critical shortage of pathologists.},

abstract = {Intestinal parasitic infection leads to several morbidities in humans worldwide, especially in tropical countries. The traditional diagnosis usually relies on manual analysis from microscopic images which is prone to human error due to morphological similarity of different parasitic eggs and abundance of impurities in a sample. Many studies have developed automatic systems for parasite egg detection to reduce human workload. However, they work with high-quality microscopes, which unfortunately remain unaffordable in some rural areas. Our work thus exploits a benefit of a low-cost USB microscope. This instrument however provides poor quality images due to the limitation of magnification (10\texttimes{}), causing difficulty in parasite detection and species classification. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based technique using transfer learning strategy to enhance the efficiency of automatic parasite classification in poor-quality microscopic images. The patch-based technique with a sliding window is employed to search for the location of the eggs. Two networks, AlexNet and ResNet50, are examined with a trade-off between architecture size and classification performance. The results show that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art object recognition methods. Our system combined with the final decision from an expert may improve the real faecal examination with low-cost microscopes.},

abstract = {Alignment between the injection pipette and the holding pipette/biological entity is crucial for successful cell microinjection. Precision alignment can reduce cell damage and improve cell microinjection. However, in the traditional microscopic vision-based method, lack of depth perception is a drawback in monocular vision. On the other hand, stereo vision with a limited baseline distance and field of view (FOV) makes it challenging to observe biological samples. In this article, a novel hybrid triple-view micro-vision system, in which a binocular telecentric micro-vision unit and an inverted microscope are combined for scene depth and detail sense, is presented for cell microinjection. Based on this system, coarse-to-fine feature extraction methods for two discrepant pipettes are proposed, and a two-stage needle alignment strategy is established based on hybrid pose/image servo control. Some feature extraction and alignment experiments are implemented, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory alignment performance (mean position deviation: about 0.1 &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$mu$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;m; mean orientation deviation: about 0.4&lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$^circ$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;) for zebra embryo microinjection, and the defined symmetry measure can reach 0.09.},

abstract = {The vibration characteristics of composite structures are influenced not only by the macro-layout and micro-configuration of the viscoelastic material but are also intricately linked with the inherent properties of the material. In this study, we present a concurrent topology design methodology for multi-scale viscoelastic materials that simultaneously considers both frequency and temperature dependencies. The equivalent properties of the biphasic viscoelastic material, comprising stiffness-phase and damping-phase constituents, are determined utilizing the homogenization technique. The optimization objective is defined as the intrinsic/weighted modal loss factors obtained through the non-linear eigensolver. A density-driven optimization framework is formulated, and sensitivity analysis is conducted. The resemblance is defined to quantitatively distinguish the different design configurations at two scales. The proposed approaches are verified using numerical simulations. The results reveal that the natural frequencies of viscoelastic structures vary slightly at different ambient temperatures and excitation frequencies, while the modal loss factors manifest considerable discrepancies. Moreover, concerning configuration similarity, the design results at both macro- and microscales remain notably consistent across different frequencies, and the obvious diversities at the two scales can be observed for all cases of different temperatures. Furthermore, it is observed that the macroscopic optimization performance exhibits an optimal value concerning changes in the microscopic component ratio, with this optimal value being influenced by temperature variations.},

abstract = {While matrix-covariate regression models have been studied in many existing works, classical statistical and computational methods for the analysis of the regression coefficient estimation are highly affected by high dimensional matrix-valued covariates. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework of matrix-covariate regression models based on a low-rank constraint and an additional regularization term for structured signals, with considerations of models of both continuous and binary responses. We propose an efficient Riemannian-steepest-descent algorithm for regression coefficient estimation. We prove that the consistency of the proposed estimator is in the order of O(r(q+m)+p/n), where r is the rank, p\texttimes{}m is the dimension of the coefficient matrix and p is the dimension of the coefficient vector. When the rank r is small, this rate improves over O(qm+p/n), the consistency of the existing work (Li et al. in Electron J Stat 15:1909-1950, 2021) that does not apply a rank constraint. In addition, we prove that all accumulation points of the iterates have similar estimation errors asymptotically and substantially attaining the minimax rate. We validate the proposed method through a simulated dataset on two-dimensional shape images and two real datasets of brain signals and microscopic leucorrhea images.},

abstract = {Segmentation of microscopic images is always considered a challenging task due to the inherent properties of the microscopic images. In general, microscopic images have ambiguous region overlaps, small regions of interest, and weak correlation among the pixels and make the segmentation task difficult. Segmentation is useful in the identification of different regions of the microscopic images. In this work, a novel method is proposed which is based on the cuckoo search method. The cuckoo search method is modified using McCulloch’s approach which is used in place of the L\'{e}vy flight and, the Luus–Jaakola heuristic is used to perform a local search in a balanced manner, to enhance the exploring capability. Three objective functions, namely Otsu’s interclass variance, Kapur’s entropy, and Tsallis entropy, are used to obtain the optimal threshold values. The proposed method is tested and evaluated on the microscopic images of the basal cell of prostate epithelium from the repository of the Center for Research in biological systems. The proposed method is evaluated using four well-known validation parameters peak signal-to-noise ratio, mean square error, Intersection over Union, and feature similarity index. Moreover, the execution time of the CPU is also compared for each method, and different numbers of clusters are used for the evaluation purpose. It has been found that the proposed method generates some promising results and can precisely identify the objects in the microscopic images.},

We find that it behaves as a paramagnetic-like tip when scanning large domains, i.e., it visualizes only the domain boundaries. Moreover, it significantly reduces the perturbation of soft magnetic samples and provides a longer probe lifetime compared to commercial low-moment probes. FMD tip was tested on a Co-based sample with out-of-plane magnetization and on a longitudinal magnetic media with in-plane recording. We prepared two FMD tips with disk diameters of 150 and 325 nm in order to analyze how the disk diameter affects the probe sensitivity and the measured width of the domain wall. Experimental results are supported by analytical calculations and numerical simulations.},

abstract = {In the field of nanoscience, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) is widely employed to visualize the surface topography and composition of materials. In this study, we present a novel SEM image classification model called NFSDense201, which incorporates several key components. Firstly, we propose a unique nested patch division approach that divides each input image into four patches of varying dimensions. Secondly, we utilize DenseNet201, a deep neural network pretrained on ImageNet1k, to extract 2920 deep features from the last fully connected and global average pooling layers. Thirdly, we introduce an iterative neighborhood component analysis function to select the most discriminative features from the merged feature vector, which is formed by concatenating the four feature vectors extracted per input image. This process results in a final feature vector of optimal length 698. Lastly, we employ a standard shallow support vector machine classifier to perform the actual classification. To evaluate the performance of NFSDense201, we conducted experiments using a large public SEM image dataset. The dataset consists of 972, 162, 326, 4590, 3820, 3925, 4755, 181, 917, and 1624.jpeg images belonging to the following microstructural categories: “biological,” “fibers,” “film-coated surfaces,” “MEMS devices and electrodes,” “nanowires,” “particles,” “pattern surfaces,” “porous sponge,” “powder,” and “tips,” respectively. For both four-class and ten-class classification tasks, we evaluated NFSDense201 using subsets of the dataset containing 5080 and 21,272 images, respectively. The results demonstrate the superior performance of NFSDense201, achieving a four-class classification accuracy rate of 99.53% and a ten-class classification accuracy rate of 97.09%. These accuracy rates compare favorably against previously published SEM image classification models. Additionally, we report the performance of NFSDense201 for each class in the dataset.},

The Stewart &amp; Cazacu–Tvergaard &amp; Needleman–Thomason (SC11–TNT) based damage model presented here is developed and implemented in the finite element software Lagamine following a semi-implicit cutting plane algorithm and a well-chosen flow rule approach. The damage of the material is characterized by the porosity ratio contained within the material. It is modelled by void nucleation, growth and coalescence mechanisms. The onset of the coalescence is established by a criterion based on Thomason’s approach. The macroscopic results obtained by the implemented model demonstrate a strong ability to predict the experimental elastoplastic mechanical behaviour of the material across a full deformation range and different types of loadings. At the microscopic level, the predicted accumulated porosity ratio of the material matrix at fracture exhibits a good correlation with the experimental observations. The element deletion feature, activated when a certain damage threshold is reached, provides a physical description of the loss of load-carrying capacity of the material during fracture.},

abstract = {This paper proposed a speed harmonization controller for partially connected and automated traffic. It regulates the flow rate of the entire traffic by adjusting only the target cruising speed of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). The proposed controller bears the following features: i) compatibility enabled with partially connected and automated traffic consisting of CAVs and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs); ii) stability ensured for the traffic system under control; iii) precision guaranteed for the demand management on a multi-lane road with the help of a small portion of vehicles. To evaluate the proposed controller, a microscopic simulation evaluation was conducted. Results confirm that the control accuracy of the proposed controller is generally over 80% across all CAV Penetration Rates, demand levels (v/c ratio) and target demand drops (within 20%). A case study is presented to demonstrate the benefit of applying the proposed controller on a bottleneck. By preventing the onset of a breakdown and, along with it, a capacity drop, the proposed controller is able to increase the flow rate by 6%, reduce the number of stops by up to 90% and delay by approximately 5%.},

abstract = {Modern computers are typically heterogeneous devices—besides the standard central processing unit (CPU), they commonly include an accelerator such as a graphics processing unit (GPU). However, exploiting the full potential of such computers is challenging, especially when complex workloads consisting of multiple computationally demanding tasks are to be processed. This paper proposes a framework called Umpalumpa, which aims to manage complex workloads on heterogeneous computers. Umpalumpa combines three aspects that ease programming and optimize code performance. Firstly, it implements a data-centric design, where data are described by their physical properties (e.&nbsp;g., location in memory, size) and logical properties (e.&nbsp;g., dimensionality, shape, padding). Secondly, Umpalumpa utilizes task-based parallelism to schedule tasks on heterogeneous nodes. Thirdly, tasks can be dynamically autotuned on a source code level according to the hardware where the task is executed and the processed data. Altogether, Umpalumpa allows for implementing a complex workload, which is automatically executed on CPUs and accelerators, and allows autotuning to maximize the performance with the given hardware and data input. Umpalumpa focuses on image processing workloads, but the concept is generic and can be extended to different types of workloads. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework on two previously accelerated applications from cryogenic electron microscopy: 3D Fourier reconstruction and Movie alignment. We show that, compared to the original implementations, Umpalumpa reduces the complexity and improves the maintainability of the main applications’ loops while improving performance through automatic memory management and autotuning of the GPU kernels.},

abstract = {A significant issue in the field of illness diagnostics is the early detection and diagnosis of leukemia, that is, the accurate distinction of malignant leukocytes with minimal costs in the early stages of the disease. Flow cytometer equipment is few, and the methods used at laboratory diagnostic centers are laborious despite the high prevalence of leukemia. The present systematic review was carried out to review the works intending to identify and categories leukemia by utilizing machine learning. It was motivated by the potential of machine learning (machine learning (ML)) in disease diagnosis. Leukemia is a blood-forming tissues cancer that affects the bone marrow and lymphatic system. It can be treated more effectively if it is detected early. This work developed a new classification model for blood microscopic pictures that distinguishes between leukemia-free and leukemia-affected images. The general proposed method in this paper consists of three main steps which are: (i) Image_Preprocessing, (ii) Feature Extraction, and (iii) Classification. An optimized CNN (OCNN) is used for classification. OCNN is utilized to detect and classify the photo as "normal" or "abnormal". Fuzzy optimization is used to optimize the hyperparameters of CNN. It is a quite beneficial to use fuzzy logic in the optimization of CNN. As illustrated from results it is shown that, with the using of OCNN classifier and after the optimization of the hyperparameters of the CNN, it achieved the best results due to the enhancement of the performance of the CNN. The OCNN has achieved 99.99% accuracy with C-NMC_Leukemia dataset.},

abstract = {The gradual deployment of automated vehicles on the existing road network will lead to a long transition period in which vehicles at different driving automation levels and capabilities will share the road with human driven vehicles, resulting into what is known as mixed traffic. Whether our road infrastructure is ready to safely and efficiently accommodate this mixed traffic remains a knowledge gap. Microscopic traffic simulation provides a proactive approach for assessing these implications. However, differences in assumptions regarding modeling automated driving in current simulation studies, and the use of different terminology make it difficult to compare the results of these studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to specify the aspects to consider for modeling automated driving in microscopic traffic simulations using harmonized concepts, to investigate how both empirical studies and microscopic traffic simulation studies on automated driving have considered the proposed aspects, and to identify the state of the practice and the research needs to further improve the modeling of automated driving. Six important aspects were identified: the role of authorities, the role of users, the vehicle system, the perception of surroundings based on the vehicle’s sensors, the vehicle connectivity features, and the role of the infrastructure both physical and digital. The research gaps and research directions in relation to these aspects are identified and proposed, these might bring great benefits for the development of more accurate and realistic modeling of automated driving in microscopic traffic simulations.},

abstract = {Deep learning has shown a great improvement in the performance of visual tasks. Image retrieval is the task of extracting the visually similar images from a database for a query image. The feature matching is performed to rank the images. Various hand-designed features have been derived in past to represent the images. Nowadays, the power of deep learning is being utilized for automatic feature learning from data in the field of biomedical image analysis. Autoencoder and Siamese networks are two deep learning models to learn the latent space (i.e., features or embedding). Autoencoder works based on the reconstruction of the image from latent space. Siamese network utilizes the triplets to learn the intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity. Moreover, Autoencoder is unsupervised, whereas Siamese network is supervised. We propose a Joint Triplet Autoencoder Network (JTANet) by facilitating the triplet learning in autoencoder framework. A joint supervised learning for Siamese network and unsupervised learning for Autoencoder is performed. Moreover, the Encoder network of Autoencoder is shared with Siamese network and referred as the Siamcoder network. The features are extracted by using the trained Siamcoder network for retrieval purpose. The experiments are performed over Histopathological Routine Colon Cancer dataset. We have observed the promising performance using the proposed JTANet model against the Autoencoder and Siamese models for colon cancer nuclei retrieval in histopathological images.},

abstract = {Recently, the automation of disease identification has been quite popular in the field of medical diagnosis. The rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for training and generalizing medical image data has proven to be quite efficient in detecting and identifying the types and sub-types of various diseases. Since the classification of large datasets of Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) stained histopathology images by experts can be expensive and time-consuming, automated processes using deep learning have been encouraged for the past decade. This paper introduces LiverNet 2.x model by modifying the previously encountered LiverNet architecture. The proposed model uses two different improvements of the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) block to extract the clinically defined features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from liver histopathology images. LiverNet 2.0 uses a modified form of ASPP block known as DenseASPP, where all the atrous convolution outputs are densely connected. Whereas LiverNet 2.1 uses fewer concatenations while maintaining a large receptive field by stacking the dilated convolutional blocks in a tree-like fashion. This paper also discusses the trade-off between LiverNet 2.0 and LiverNet 2.1 in terms of accuracy and computational complexity. All comparison model and the proposed model is trained and tested on the patches of two different histopathological datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model performs better compared to reference models. For the KMC Liver dataset, LiverNet 2.0 and LiverNet 2.1 achieved an accuracy of 97.50% and 97.14% respectively. Accuracy of 94.37% and 97.14% for the TCGA Liver dataset are achieved.},

abstract = {Pedestrian tactical choices and operational movement in evacuations essentially pertain to decision-making under risk and uncertainty. However, in microscopic evacuation models, this attribute has been greatly overlooked, even lacking a methodology to delineate the related decision characteristics (bounded rationality and risk attitudes), let alone their effects on evacuation processes. This work presents an innovative two-layer floor field cellular automaton model framework, where three intertwined sub-modules respectively dedicated to modelling the exit choice, the locomotion movement and the exit-choice changing behaviours are proposed and integrated as an entity. By introducing various decision-making elements computed by the proposed algorithm, Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) is proposed for the first time to model the exit choice and locomotion decision-making under risk and uncertainty. In the exit-choice changing module, attractive and repulsive forces are invented to jointly describe the tendency to revisit the routing decision. Each sub-module and the whole framework are validated in manifold indoor environments. The simulation results of the modules with CPT accord with the empirics from the evacuation experiments and are superior over those from the state-of-the-art models. The degree of rationality and risk attitudes are proven to have significant impacts on tactical and operational decisions. Furthermore, irrational behaviour in decision-making is not variably detrimental to locomotion efficiency of pedestrians. The proposed framework can serve as an elegant tool to predict pedestrian dynamics. The behavioural findings shed new light on understanding and modelling the tactical and operational decisions in evacuations.},

abstract = {Many advanced technologies have been developed in the medical field where leukaemia plays a vital role, which may cause serious issues when it is unidentified. In the convolution method, human error may occur, so to avoid it, many tools have been introduced, like Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), which helps to diagnose and classify systems for leukaemia, and it is also shown to be an excellent function approximation tool. ANFIS also uses the ANN theory, which is used to conclude the attributes of neuro-fuzzy systems. But the accuracy is not up to the mark. To overcome this drawback, we have proposed an improved ANFIS (I ANFIS) model to predict leukaemia data using a Euclidean distance to measure between the trained feature data and the test feature data. An Improved Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Neural Network (ANFNN) is also introduced, which helps the input space be partitioned into many local regions by the fuzzy clustering, in which the computation complexity is decreased and, based on both the separation and the compactness among the clusters, the fuzzy rule number is determined by the validity function. Then, the premise parameters and consequent parameters are trained by a hybrid learning algorithm which uses forward and backward passes. Following the arrangement of principle parameters, until layer 4, a node outputs move ahead in the forward pass and, using Least Square Estimate (LSE), the consequent parameters are calculated for each node. Then an error measure is calculated for each node. To update principal parameters, the error signals are distributed backward with gradient descent in the backward pass. Improved ANFIS obtains the best accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of 97.14%, 96% and 90%, and classification for all the cell types, especially in the microscopic blood cell dataset.},

Approximating the slow manifold, however, may be computationally as challenging as the original problem. If the system is defined by a legacy simulation code or a microscopic simulator, it may be impossible to perform the manipulations needed to directly approximate the slow manifold. In this paper we demonstrate that with the knowledge only of a set of “slow” variables that can be used toparameterize the slow manifold, we can conveniently compute, using a legacy simulator, on a nearby manifold. Forward and reverse integration, as well as the location of fixed points are illustrated for a discretization of the Chafee-Infante PDE for parameter values for which an Inertial Manifold is known to exist, and can be used to validate the computational results.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the second utmost common cancer among women. In this research study, two feature selection methods, namely Consistency first Search-Best First search (CFS-BFS) and Consistency-Best First Search (Consistency-BFS) are used to find out the significant biomarkers for breast cancer. The feature selection methods pick a small count of important and relevant genes providing a higher degree of accuracy. The count of biomarkers selected in Consistency-BFS is less in comparison to CFS-BFS method. Three common identified biomarkers’ genes are recognised to help in diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer, namely SLC39A6, ESR1, and CDC20 are selected on the basis of histologic-grade and molecular subtype of breast cancer. These three genes identified are even found in PAM50 and judged for survival variances using Kaplan-Meier Survival Model. The result suggested that overexpression of SLC39A6, ESR1, and CDC20 proves to be an influencing factor for the poor prognosis of patients suffering from breast cancer. The proposed method is successful in creating a prognostic gene signature in forecasting the survival likelihood of patients.},

abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most frequent chronic liver diseases worldwide. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive type of NAFLD that may cause cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or almost mortality. Therefore, early diagnosis of the NASH is crucial. NASH is scored using the main histopathological features: ballooning, inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis. The diagnosis of NASH by pathologists is time-consuming and can vary subjectively. On the other hand, several studies have reported deep learning approaches to enable fully automated NASH scoring. However, these studies suffer from limited labeled and imbalanced datasets. The purpose of this study to achieve fully automated NASH scoring with deep learning models that overcome data limitations. This study proposes an unsupervised transfer learning model for NASH scoring and fibrosis staging on a small-size dataset within two steps. In the first step, Convolutional Auto Encoder (CAE) is utilized as a deep feature extractor in an unsupervised manner during reconstruction. The second step is fine-tuning for classification consisting of the CAE encoder set as initial layers combined with fully connected layers and softmax. The proposed unsupervised transfer learning model is evaluated on a public NASH dataset. We compare the performance of the proposed network (CAE+classifier) with transfer learning models including Inception-v3, VGG16, ResNet-50. The proposed model has 94.87% AUC for ballooning, 89.47% AUC for inflammation, 96.15% AUC for steatosis, and 93.18% AUC for fibrosis. The proposed model is superior to transfer learning models (Inception-v3, VGG16, ResNet-50) with less parameter size and low computational complexity on a small NASH dataset.},

abstract = {Recurrence is the key factor affecting the prognosis of osteosarcoma. Currently, there is a lack of clinically useful tools to predict osteosarcoma recurrence. The application of pathological images for artificial intelligence‐assisted accurate prediction of tumour outcomes is increasing. Thus, the present study constructed a quantitative histological image classifier with tumour nuclear features to predict osteosarcoma outcomes using haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)‐stained whole‐slide images (WSIs) from 150 osteosarcoma patients. We first segmented eight distinct tissues in osteosarcoma H&amp;E‐stained WSIs, with an average accuracy of 90.63% on the testing set. The tumour areas were automatically and accurately acquired, facilitating the tumour cell nuclear feature extraction process. Based on six selected tumour nuclear features, we developed an osteosarcoma histological image classifier (OSHIC) to predict the recurrence and survival of osteosarcoma following standard treatment. The quantitative OSHIC derived from tumour nuclear features independently predicted the recurrence and survival of osteosarcoma patients, thereby contributing to precision oncology. Moreover, we developed a fully automated workflow to extract quantitative image features, evaluate the diagnostic values of feature sets and build classifiers to predict osteosarcoma outcomes. Thus, the present study provides a novel tool for predicting osteosarcoma outcomes, which has a broad application prospect in clinical practice.},

abstract = {This contribution introduces and discusses a formulation of poro-hyperelasticity at finite strains. The prediction of the time-dependent response of such media requires consideration of their characteristic multi-scale and multi-physics parameters. In the present work this is achieved by formulating a non-dimensionalised fluid–solid interaction problem (FSI) at the pore level using an arbitrary Lagrange–Euler description (ALE). The resulting coupled systems of PDEs on the reference configuration are expanded and analysed using the asymptotic homogenisation technique. This approach yields three partially novel systems of PDEs: the macroscopic/effective problem and two supplementary microscale problems (fluid and solid). The latter two provide the microscopic response fields whose average value is required in real-time/online form to determine the macroscale response (a concurrent multi-scale approach). In order to overcome the computational challenges related to the above multi-scale closure, this work introduces a surrogate approach for replacing the direct numerical simulation with an artificial neural network. This methodology allows for solving finite strain (multi-scale) porohyperelastic problems accurately using direct automated differentiation through the strain energy. Optimal and reliable training data sets are produced from direct numerical simulations of the fully-resolved problem by including a simple real-time output density check for adaptive sampling step refinement. The data-driven approach is complemented by a sensitivity analysis of the RVE response. The significance of the presented approach for finite strain poro-elasticity/poro-hyperelasticity is shown in the numerical benchmark of a multi-scale confined consolidation problem. Finally, to show the robustness of the method, the system response is dimensionalised using characteristic values of soil and brain mechanics scenarios.},

abstract = {The task of cell segmentation in microscope images is difficult and popular. In recent years, deep learning-based techniques have made incredible progress in medical and microscopy image segmentation applications. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach called Residual-Atrous MultiResUnet with Channel Attention Mechanism (RAMRU-CAM) for cell segmentation, which combines MultiResUnet architecture with Channel Attention Mechanism (CAM) and Residual-Atrous connections. The Residual-Atrous path mitigates the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder stages and manages the spatial dimension of feature maps. Furthermore, the Channel Attention Mechanism (CAM) blocks are used in the decoder stages to better maintain the spatial details before concatenating the feature maps from the encoder phases to the decoder phases. We evaluated our proposed model on the PhC-C2DH-U373 and Fluo-N2DH-GOWT1 datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms recent variants of the U-Net model and the state-of-the-art approaches. We have demonstrated how our model can segment cells precisely while using fewer parameters and low computational complexity.},

abstract = {Microscopic traffic flow models enable predictions of traffic operations, which allows traffic engineers to assess the efficiency and safety effects of roadway designs. Modeling vehicle trajectories inside intersections is challenging because there is an infinite number of possible paths in a two-dimensional space, and drivers can simultaneously adapt their speeds as well. To date, human driver models for simultaneous longitudinal and lateral vehicle control based on the infrastructure characteristics and interactions with other drivers inside an intersection are still lacking. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it proposes an integrated microscopic traffic flow model to describe human-driven vehicle maneuvers under interactions. Drivers plan their heading and acceleration in the predicted future to minimize costs representing undesirable situations. The model works with a joint optimization for an interaction cost term. The weights associated with the interaction cost reflect how selfish or altruistic drivers are. Second, the proposed model endogenously gives the order of vehicles in case of crossing paths. Third, the paper develops a clustered validation method for microscopic traffic flow models with interacting vehicles, which account for interdriver variations. Results show that the model can accurately describe vehicle passing orders of interacting maneuvers, paths, and speeds against empirical data. The model can be applied to assess various intersection designs.Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 71971140 and 52122215] and the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [Grant 20ZR1439300].},

abstract = {Macrobends are optical fiber structures suitable for detecting motion changes. This structure has been developed using single-mode fibers and a combination of single-mode and multimode fibers called hetero-core. In this study, a new macrobending structure was designed and developed by adding a nano-ZnO element to the fiber optic core based on Revolution 4.0. The addition of nanomaterial elements involves an etching process that uses harmful chemicals or high-cost laser technology. Therefore, hetero-core was applied in this study to replace the etching process. The ZnO-coated fiber optics with 10 (ZnO1), 20 (ZnO2), and 30 (ZnO3) times of dip coating were developed using the dip-coating method and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Sensitivity measurement was conducted with glued optical fiber in the form of bending using a tape with a bending dimension of 2.5 cm \texttimes{} 1.5 cm and a wavelength of 1,550 nm. Morphological characterization using SEM proves that nanoparticles are attached to the optical fiber, and the EDX characterization confirms that the nanoparticles are ZnO elements. Optical fiber sensor sensitivity using core sizes 9, 50–9–50, 50–9–50 (ZnO1), 50–9–50 (ZnO2), and 50–9–50 (ZnO3) achieved sensitivity values of 0.91, 1.61, 2.98, 3.34, and 3.51, respectively. This study successfully produced ZnO-coated optical fiber sensors with a hetero-core structure without performing the etching process and successfully increased the sensitivity of the sensors.},

abstract = {Serial scanning electron microscopy (sSEM) has recently been developed to reconstruct complex largescale neural connectomes, through learning-based instance segmentation. However, blurry images are inevitable amid prolonged automated data acquisition due to imprecision in autofocusing and autostigmation, which impose a great challenge to accurate segmentation of the massive sSEM image data. Recently, learning-based methods, such as adversarial learning and supervised learning, have been proven to be effective for blind EM image deblurring. However, in practice, these methods suffer from the limited training dataset and the underrepresentation of high-resolution decoded features. Here, we propose a semisupervised learning guided progressive decoding network (SGPN) to exploit unlabeled blurry images for training and progressively enrich high-resolution feature representation. The proposed method outperforms the latest deblurring models on real SEM images with much less ground truth input. The improvement of the PSNR and SSIM is 1.04 dB and 0.086, respectively. We then trained segmentation models with deblurred datasets and demonstrated significant improvement in segmentation accuracy. The A-rand decreased by 0.119 and 0.026, respectively, for 2D and 3D segmentation.},

The spherical and rod-like morphologies were confirmed for the NPs by the images taken using electron microscopy. The reducing agents in the aqueous extracts of R. multifidus converted the ionic zinc to zinc nanoparticles, and these NPs exhibit credible antibacterial effects against tested bacterial species. The biosynthesized ZnO NPs revealed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The order of the antibacterial potential of the NPs was found to follow the order: S. aureus (17.10 ± 0.45 mm) &gt; B. subtilis (16.10 ± 0.15 mm) &gt; E. coli (14.5 ± 0.32 mm) &gt; P. aeruginosa (13 ± 0.0 mm). The antioxidant activities of the produced ZnO NPs in various ratios showed the potentiality of phytochemicals to scavenge the free radicals, which is encouraging for the discovery of novel compounds for the treatment of cancer diseases.},

The entire MMCs specimens achieve greater mechanical characteristics; the specimen fabricated with a maximum volume fraction of 7.5 wt% of SiC accumulates higher strength than the other volume fractions samples. The SiC plays a very tedious role in improving mechanical attributes. The fabricated MMCs were highly utilized in the applications of automotive and aerospace usages. This application is fully employed with lesser weight and maximum strength conditions to fulfill the mechanical performances.

abstract = {Nanofluid is a new fluid with special characteristics that can be used in various industrial heat transfer applications. The nanofluid was created using the two-step approach of dispersing nanoparticles into Jatropha oil. The experiments were conducted for four samples of mixture nanofluid at four different volume concentrations of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2%. The nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffractometric analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The greatest increase in thermal conductivity for CuO–Jatropha oil nanofluids was made possible by 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2% mixture was 4.5%, 6.01%, 7.6, and 9.1%. The study observed that a mixture achieved the highest thermal conductivity for nanofluid at 2%. At a mixture of 0.5%, the lowest value of thermal conductivity within the range under consideration, a “deeding” effect was seen. To determine the thermal conductivity of CuO–Jatropha oil nanofluids based on temperature, volume concentration, and nanoparticle mixture volume concentrations, the study suggested and compared four sample models. The effect of nanoparticles on the rise of thermal conductivity and viscosity was investigated at temperatures ranging from 298 to 323 K. The X-ray diffractometer is used to characterize nanoparticles. Viscosity and thermal conductivity have been tested in the lab. The findings show that the copper oxide nanoparticles improved the base fluid’s thermophysical abilities more than Jatropha oil alone. For the evaluation of the thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluid, new empirical correlations were presented based on experimental data. The thermal conductivity of the nanofluids increases as the temperature rises, while the viscosity of the nanofluids decreases.},

abstract = {The intention of this research is to recapitulate the two different fillers like E glass fiber and nanocarbon fiber, which were utilized to fabricate the polymer matrix composites by the assistance of epoxy resin. The mechanical compression molding was influenced to produce the polymer-based nanocomposites under consideration of optimal process parameters. There are three different weight fractions E glass fiber (40%, 45%, and 50%), nanocarbon fiber (10%, 15%, and 20%), and epoxy concentrations (30%, 40%, and 50%), respectively, that were used to produce the polymer matrix composites. Those processing parameters were designed by the L9 Taguchi with DOE technique to conduct the mechanical tests like tensile strength and hardness properties. The signal-to-noise ratios were successfully accomplished to identify optimal process parameters for improving the individual responses. The ANOVA and interaction was additional supports to enhance the mechanical properties. The scanning electron microscope was used to examine the fracture surfaces at the tensile fracture specimens with optimal conditions. Moreover, the maximum mechanical characteristics were attained by the increasing of nanocarbon fiber in the processed polymer matrix composites.},

abstract = {Transition or metastasis is a main characteristic of tumor developmental processes. However, the mechanism behind the transition and what costs involved are obscure when the tumor is exposed to a colored microscopic environment. Here, focusing on the regulatory role of noises from its strength and correlation time on phenotypic diversity of tumors, we show that (1) when the noise strength (NS) is fixed, extending the autocorrelation time (AT) of multiplicative noise can regulate bidirectionally the tumor phenotype, i.e., it can promote the diffusion also contribute to killing cancer cells simultaneously; (2) AT of additive noise can reduce the occurrence probability of cancer cells, but the NS can increase this probability; (3) the effect of the cross-correlated strength (CS) on cell phenotype is twofold, i.e., increasing CS may urge the mean first passage time (MFPT) of switching to the tumor state to have the minimum and maximum values but the cross-correlation time (CT) always makes the MFPT to have a minimum value. In addition, NS can make MFPT to have a peak. Moreover, by reconstructing the reaction network from the mesoscopic scale, we further show that AT of multiplicative noise can increase energy consumption, and there exists a trade-off between NS and AT of additive noise. We also show that the energy consumption is monotonically decreasing with increasing the CT but the CS can amplify the difference of this dependence. The overall analysis implies that tumor cells would make use of external noise to survive in fluctuating environments.},

abstract = {Natural fiber composites are now more costly than traditional building materials. Currently, industries are moving from traditional materials to natural fiber composites, and the price of natural fiber should be reduced through greater utilization of industrial production. This work aims to determine how matrix alteration affects the interlaminar characteristics of a hemp fiber-reinforced epoxy composite containing nano silicon oxide particles. Interlaminar modulus of rupture in Types I and II is assessed using dual cantilevered beams and end-notched deformation testing samples. Mechanical mixing and sonication are used to blend nanoscale SiO2 (30 nm) into the resin at concentrations of 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 wt%. The composites were made using the compression molding method. The composites were tested according to the American Society for Testing and Materials standards after manufacturing. The findings show that adding nanoparticles enhances interlaminar toughness values. Interlaminar fracture toughness improved by 20.25% and 30.35% for 0.4 wt% SiO2, respectively. The fiber matrix interaction and failure causes are examined using scanning electron microscope images.},

Herein, a compact, solid cerium stearate superhydrophobic-coated stainless steel mesh (SSSM) was prepared by a simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly one-step electrodeposition process. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and contact angle measurement were used to characterize the surface coating (composition, morphology, and contact angle) of SSSM. The results show that the SSSM surface is a dense mastoid cerium stearate micronanostructure coating, and its static contact angle with water can reach 162.73°. In addition, it has excellent self-cleaning performance for conventional simulated pollutants, and the contact angle can still reach 161° after 28 days of storage. In the wear resistance and corrosion resistance tests, the contact angle can still be kept above 150° after 600 mm abrasion under the load of 19.6 kPa, the corrosion current of SSSM is reduced by two orders of magnitude, and its corrosion inhibition efficiency reaches 99.74%. In addition, the oil/water separation performance of SSSM is also very good, and the separation efficiency for different oil/water mixtures exceeds 97%. This study will provide important data support and method reference for the preparation of metal anticorrosion superhydrophobic material coating and the development of environment-friendly and efficient oil–water separation materials.},

abstract = {Our work was devoted to studying the effect of different concentrations of Mentha spicata aqueous extract on the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in order to obtain the most effective of these concentrations for bacteria inhibitory activity. Different concentrations of the aqueous M. spicata extract (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 mM) were used as biological solvent to synthesize AgNPs by means of the reduction method. The crystal structure and morphology of the NPs were characterized UV–vis spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The inhibition effect of AgNPs on Escherichia coli was studied to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The dark yellow color of the M. spicata extract aqueous solution indicates the successful synthesis of the AgNPs. UV spectra of the NPs show a gradual increase in absorption with increasing concentration of aqueous M. spicata extract solution from 0.25 to 1.00 mM, accompanied by a shift in the wavelength from 455 to 479 nm along with a change in the nanoparticle size from 31 to 9 nm. The tests also showed a high activity of the particles against bacteria (E. coli) ranging between 15.6 and 62.5 µg/ml. From the AgNPs, it was confirmed that aqueous M. spicata extract is an effective biosolvent for the synthesis of different sizes of AgNPs according to the solvent concentration. The AgNPs also proved effectual for the killing of bacteria.},

Researchers have been looking for materials that can combat these two problems at the same time. In the present study, we describe the synthesis of spherical copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) by the chemical precipitation method and evaluate their photocatalytic performance against MB dye and antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus. CuO NPs were produced using copper acetate monohydrate (Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O) as the precursor and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the reducing agent. Synthesized CuO NPs were characterized using a combination of techniques, including ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction analysis. All the analyses indicated that monoclinic CuO NPs were formed with a spherical shape and an average particle size of 6.2 nm. Photocatalytic experiments indicated that 55.5% of a 10 ppm MB dye solution was degraded by the prepared nano-CuO photocatalyst only after 60 min. Additionally, synthesized CuO NPs demonstrated, to some extent, the zone of inhibition on the S. aureus bacterium’s cell wall. It is inspiring that CuO NPs can be used to solve two problems of MB dye contamination and S. aureus bacterial infection simultaneously.},

abstract = {Volumetric data abounds in medical imaging and other fields. With the improved imaging quality and the increased resolution, volumetric datasets are getting so large that the existing tools have become inadequate for processing and analyzing the data. Here we consider the problem of computing tetrahedral meshes to represent large volumetric datasets with labeled multiple materials, which are often encountered in medical imaging or microscopy optical slice tomography. Such tetrahedral meshes are a more compact and expressive geometric representation so are in demand for efficient visualization and simulation of the data, which are impossible if the original large volumetric data are used directly due to the large memory requirement. Existing methods for meshing volumetric data are not scalable for handling large datasets due to their sheer demand on excessively large run-time memory or failure to produce a tet-mesh that preserves the multi-material structure of the original volumetric data. In this article we propose a novel approach, called &lt;italic&gt;Marching Windows&lt;/italic&gt;, that uses a moving window and a disk-swap strategy to reduce the run-time memory footprint, devise a new scheme that guarantees to preserve the topological structure of the original dataset, and adopt an error-guided optimization technique to improve both geometric approximation error and mesh quality. Extensive experiments show that our method is capable of processing very large volumetric datasets beyond the capability of the existing methods and producing tetrahedral meshes of high quality.},

Concerning this, machine learning and artificial intelligence systems have found as vital and critical concepts. One of the critical domains of human life is farming, which indeed requires precision in decision making in diversified phases of farming. One among them is notifying the germination ability of seeds to cultivate with optimal results in both formats of quantity and quality of the crop. The role of computer-aided methods in farming has significantly increased in the past decade, which often termed as precision farming. The contribution of this manuscript endeavored to define a supervised learning model that includes the method of optimal feature selection and performing binary classification to determine the germination ability of seed samples, which precisely termed as “Supervised Learning-based Seed Germination Ability Prediction for Precision Farming.” The diversified features of the microscopic images of both qualified and unqualified seeds shall consider as input corpus to perform the supervised learning in the proposed model. The significance of the model has scaled by performing experiments on the microscopic images of the paddy seeds, which considerably evincing the accuracy of the proposed approach with minimal false alarming. The contribution serves as a decision support tool to identify the quality seeds towards germination.},

The radiative recombination accounts for the actual photon density of states that is modified by cavity effects and plasmonic resonances, and via coupling to a quantum transport formalism, the impact of photon recycling is propagated from rigorous wave optical simulation of secondary photogeneration directly into a modification of the current–voltage characteristics of the full photovoltaic device. The self-consistent microscopic treatment of the interacting electronic and optical degrees of freedom in a functional device context elucidates the impact on photovoltaic performance of nanoscale device design in terms of band profiles and contact layers by revealing their effect on the radiative rates and currents. As an example, plasmonic losses related to metallic reflectors are identified in both, emission and re-absorption, and partial mitigation is achieved via dielectric passivation or detaching of the reflector.},

Hence, in this article, we fill this gap by leveraging the large deviation theory to conduct the first micro study of natural forking, aiming to reveal its inherent mechanism substantially. Our work is featured by 1) &lt;italic&gt;conceptual innovation&lt;/italic&gt;. We creatively abstract the blockchain overlay network as a “service system”. This allows us to investigate natural forking from the perspective of “supply and demand”. Based on this, we can identify the competitive dynamics of blockchain and construct a queuing model to characterize natural forking; 2) &lt;italic&gt;progressiveness&lt;/italic&gt;. We scrutinize the natural forking probability as well as its decay rate via a three-step scheme from simple to complex, which are the single-source i.i.d. scheme, the single-source non-i.i.d. scheme, and the many-source non-i.i.d. scheme. By doing so, we can answer &lt;italic&gt;when&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;how fast&lt;/italic&gt; should we take actions and &lt;italic&gt;what&lt;/italic&gt; actions should we take against natural forking. Our valuable findings can not only put forward decisive guidelines theoretically from the top level, but also engineer optimal countermeasures operationally on a practical level to thwart natural forking.},

abstract = {Departure time choice models play a crucial role in determining the traffic load in transportation systems. Most studies that consider departure time user equilibrium (DTUE) problems make assumptions on the user characteristics (e.g., distribution of desired arrival time and trip length) or dynamic traffic model (e.g., classic bathtub or point queue models) in order to analyze the problem. This paper relaxes these assumptions and introduces a new framework to model and analyze the DTUE problem based on the so-called mean field games (MFGs) theory. MFGs allow us to define players at the microscopic level similar to classical game theory models, translating the effect of players’ decisions to macroscopic models. In this paper, we first present a continuous departure time choice model and investigate the equilibria of the system. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of the equilibrium and characterize the DTUE. Then, a discrete approximation of the system is provided based on deterministic differential game models to numerically obtain the equilibrium of the system. To examine the efficiency of the proposed model, we compare it with the departure time choice models in the literature. We apply our framework to a standard test case and observe that the solutions obtained based on our model are 5.6% better in terms of relative cost compared with the solutions determined based on previous studies. Moreover, our proposed model converges with fewer iterations than the reference solution method in the literature. Finally, the model is scaled up to the real test case corresponding to the whole Lyon metropolis with a real demand pattern. The results show that the proposed framework is able to tackle a much larger test case than usual to include multiple preferred travel times and heterogeneous trip lengths more accurately than existing models.},

abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication transcription complex (RTC) is a multi-domain protein responsible for replicating and transcribing the viral mRNA inside a human cell. Attacking RTC function with pharmaceutical compounds is a pathway to treating COVID-19. Conventional tools, e.g. cryo-electron microscopy and all-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD), do not provide sufficiently high resolution or timescale to capture important dynamics of this molecular machine. Consequently, we develop an innovative workflow that bridges the gap between these resolutions, using mesoscale fluctuating finite element analysis (FFEA) continuum simulations and a hierarchy of AI-methods that continually learn and infer features for maintaining consistency between AAMD and FFEA simulations. We leverage a multi-site distributed workflow manager to orchestrate AI, FFEA, and AAMD jobs, providing optimal resource utilization across HPC centers. Our study provides unprecedented access to study the SARS-CoV-2 RTC machinery, while providing general capability for AI-enabled multi-resolution simulations at scale.},

The aim of providing this dataset is that more researchers from relevant fields can push forward this particular area of research.

We integrate the proposal, namely ResNetZ, into ResNet, and appraise it on the FLIM dataset. Since ResNetZ can be configured with a shortcut connection and the aggregations by Addition or Concatenation, we first evaluate the impact of different configurations on the performance. We thoroughly examine various ResNetZ variants to demonstrate the superiority. We also compare our model with a feature-level multi-scale model to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of multi-scale architectures at different levels.},

abstract = {A crime scene can provide valuable evidence critical to explain reason and modality of the occurred crime, and it can also lead to the arrest of criminals. The type of evidence collected by crime scene investigators or by law enforcement may accordingly effective involved cases. Bullets and cartridge cases examination is of paramount importance in forensic science because they may contain traces of microscopic striations, impressions and markings, which are unique and reproducible as “ballistic fingerprints”. The analysis of bullets and cartridge cases is a complicated and challenging process, typically based on optical comparison, leading to the identification of the employed firearm. New methods have recently been proposed for more accurate comparisons, which rely on three-dimensionally reconstructed data. This paper aims at further advancing recent methods by introducing a novel immersive technique for ballistics comparison by means of Virtual Reality. Users can three-dimensionally examine the cartridge cases shapes through intuitive natural gestures, from any vantage viewpoint (including internal iper-magnified views), while having at their disposal sets of visual aids which could not be easily implemented in desktop-based applications. A user study was conducted to assess viability and performance of our solution, which involved fourteen individuals acquainted with the standard procedures used by law enforcement agencies. Results clearly indicated that our approach lead to faster adaptation of users to the UI/UX and more accurate and explainable ballistics examination results.},

abstract = {U-Net is a widely adopted neural network in the domain of medical image segmentation. Despite its quick embracement by the medical imaging community, its performance suffers on complicated datasets. The problem can be ascribed to its simple feature extracting blocks: encoder/decoder, and the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Variants of U-Net (such as R2U-Net) have been proposed to address the problem of simple feature extracting blocks by making the network deeper, but it does not deal with the semantic gap problem. On the other hand, another variant UNET++ deals with the semantic gap problem by introducing dense skip connections but has simple feature extraction blocks. To overcome these issues, we propose a new U-Net based medical image segmentation architecture R2U++. In the proposed architecture, the adapted changes from vanilla U-Net are: (1) the plain convolutional backbone is replaced by a deeper recurrent residual convolution block. The increased field of view with these blocks aids in extracting crucial features for segmentation which is proven by improvement in the overall performance of the network. (2) The semantic gap between encoder and decoder is reduced by dense skip pathways. These pathways accumulate features coming from multiple scales and apply concatenation accordingly. The modified architecture has embedded multi-depth models, and an ensemble of outputs taken from varying depths improves the performance on foreground objects appearing at various scales in the images. The performance of R2U++ is evaluated on four distinct medical imaging modalities: electron microscopy, X-rays, fundus, and computed tomography. The average gain achieved in IoU score is 1.5 ± 0.37% and in dice score is 0.9 ± 0.33% over UNET++, whereas, 4.21 ± 2.72 in IoU and 3.47 ± 1.89 in dice score over R2U-Net across different medical imaging segmentation datasets.},

abstract = {Simulating liquid-textile interaction has received great attention in computer graphics recently. Most existing methods take textiles as particles or parameterized meshes. Although these methods can generate visually pleasing results, they cannot simulate water content at a microscopic level due to the lack of geometrically modeling of textile's anisotropic structure. In this paper, we develop a method for yarn-level simulation of hygroscopicity of textiles and evaluate it using various quantitative metrics. We model textiles in a fiber-yarn-fabric multi-scale manner and consider the dynamic coupled physical mechanisms of liquid spreading, including wetting, wicking, moisture sorption/desorption, and transient moisture-heat transfer in textiles. Our method can accurately simulate liquid spreading on textiles with different fiber materials and geometrical structures with consideration of air temperatures and humidity conditions. It visualizes the hygroscopicity of textiles to demonstrate their moisture management ability. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate our method and explore various factors to analyze their influence on liquid spreading and hygroscopicity of textiles.},

abstract = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are proving to be the first generation of driver-assist enabled vehicles. In order to study the impacts of ACC vehicles on string stability and traffic flow characteristics, accurately calibrating microscopic car following models is crucial to simulate inter-vehicle dynamics. While many car following models have been used to simulate car following behavior, a single, continuous function may not describe both acceleration and braking realistically. We propose an asymmetric model which is based on the symmetric optimal velocity relative velocity (OVRV) model and switch parameters under different conditions to realize and reproduce car following dynamics of ACC vehicles. We conduct an analytical string stability analysis and the string stability criterion is derived. The calibration and simulation results show that the proposed asymmetric ACC model reduces model spacing error by up to 38% compared with the symmetric OVRV model. Compared with other commonly used asymmetric car following models in the transportation community, the proposed asymmetric ACC model can reduce spacing error by 44.8%. Furthermore, we validate the derived string stability criterion with a numerical test simulating with a string of vehicles. We conclude that an asymmetric car following model shows more accurate performance in the capture of ACC car following behavior.},

abstract = {The core value of simulation-based autonomy tests is to create densely extreme traffic scenarios to test the performance and robustness of the algorithms and systems. Test scenarios are usually designed or extracted manually from the real-world data, which is inefficient with a remarkable domain gap compared with testing in real scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to automatically generate realistic and diverse dynamic traffic scenarios making autonomy tests efficient. Moreover, scenario generation is expected to be interpretable, controllable, and diversified, which can be hard to achieve simultaneously by methods based on rules or deep networks. In this paper, we propose a dynamic traffic scenario generation method called SceGene, inspired by genetic inheritance and mutation processes in biological intelligence. SceGene applies biological processes, such as crossover and mutation, to exchange and mutate the content of scenarios, and involves the natural selection process to control generation direction. SceGene has three main parts: 1) a new representation method for describing the traffic scenarios’ feature; 2) a new scenario generation algorithm based on crossover, mutation, and selection; and 3) an abnormal scenario information repair method based on the microscopic driving model. Evaluation on the public traffic scenario dataset shows that SceGene can ensure highly realistic and diversified scenario generation in an interpretable and controllable way, significantly improving the efficiency of the simulation-based autonomy tests.},

abstract = {Transit Signal Priority (TSP) has been proposed and implemented to reduce transit travel time, provide better schedule adherence, and improve transit efficiency. However, concerns have been raised about causing delays to cross street and left-turn movements. The cost-effective implementation of TSP requires methods to support the decisions associated with the implementation. The objective of this research was to examine the existing TSP guidance and propose enhanced planning-level guidelines for TSP deployment that can be applied to identify intersections where implementing TSP is beneficial. The proposed guidelines take consideration of bus delay, bus frequency, geometric and traffic feasibility, as well as the impacts on other movements. The effectiveness of the proposed guidelines was evaluated in comparison with existing guidelines using a microscopic simulation approach. The simulation results showed that the proposed TSP guidelines produce a better-balanced solution for minimizing both main street bus travel times and delays for other affected movements. The proposed guidelines also help to cut the TSP implementation costs by reducing the number of intersections identified for TSP implementation.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the leading death cause among women nowadays. Several methods have been proposed for the detection of breast cancer. Various machine learning-based automatic diagnosis systems have been developed known as Computer Aided Diagnostics (CAD) systems. Initial CAD systems were based on machine learning algorithms however due to the automatic feature extraction ability of convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based deep learning models are widely adopted. Deep learning is widely used in various fields. Healthcare is one of the essential field that deep learning has transformed. Another common issue faced by the patients is difference of opinion among different pathologists and medical practitioners. Such human errors often lead to misleading or delayed judgment, which may be fatal to human life. To improve decision consistency, efficiency, and error reduction, researchers in the field of healthcare are using deep learning-based approaches and achieved state of art results. In this study, a deep learning (DL) and transfer learning-based approach is proposed to classify histopathological images for breast cancer diagnosis. In this study, we have adopted patch selection approach to classify breast histopathological images on small number of training images using transfer learning without losing the performance. Initially, patches are extracted from Whole Slide Images and fed into the CNN for features extraction. Based on these features, the discriminative patches are selected and then fed to Efficient-Net architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. Features extracted from Efficient-Net architecture are also used to train a SVM classifier. The proposed model outperforms the baseline methods in terms of multiple performance measures.},

abstract = {Previous RGB-D saliency detection methods adopt different fusion schemes to fuse the RGB images and depth maps or their saliency maps. However, both the feature maps from different modalities and the different features within the same maps are not of equal importance. To address this problem, We present a new precise RGB-D saliency detection framework in this work that selectively fuses features of different resolutions from two modalities, considering the global location and local detail complementarity. Depth data contains superior position discrimination, which has been shown to enhance saliency prediction. However, errors or missing areas in a depth map or random distribution along an object boundary will introduce negative effect. Therefore, we design a backbone network and an edge detection module that can select useful representations from RGB images and depth maps with attention mechanism and effectively integrate macroscopic and microscopic features from the two modalities. The accurate location of salient objects with fine edge details is realized by cross-modal selective fusion and complementation. We also propose a triple loss function to improve the credibility of the network for hard sample detection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation experiments on six benchmark datasets show that our method has a superior performance compared with 11 existing state-of-the-art methods with various evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {In the Gastric Histopathology Image Classification (GHIC) tasks, which are usually weakly supervised learning missions, there is inevitably redundant information in the images. Therefore, designing networks that can focus on distinguishing features has become a popular research topic. In this paper, to accomplish the tasks of GHIC superiorly and assist pathologists in clinical diagnosis, an intelligent Hierarchical Conditional Random Field based Attention Mechanism (HCRF-AM) model is proposed. The HCRF-AM model consists of an Attention Mechanism (AM) module and an Image Classification (IC) module. In the AM module, an HCRF model is built to extract attention regions. In the IC module, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained with the attention regions selected, and then an algorithm called Classification Probability-based Ensemble Learning is applied to obtain the image-level results from the patch-level output of the CNN. In the experiment, a classification specificity of 96.67% is achieved on a gastric histopathology dataset with 700 images. Our HCRF-AM model demonstrates high classification performance and shows its effectiveness and future potential in the GHIC field. In addition, the AM module and transfer learning technique allow the network to generalize well to other types of image data except histopathology images, and we obtain 95.5% and 95.8% accuracies on IG02 and Oxford-IIIT Pet Datasets.},

We first propose an integral channel feature (ICF)-based detector which is able to localize the dense and arbitrarily oriented targets with low false positive rate. Then instead of treating target detection and tracking as two separated problems as many previous works did, we propose to refine the detection results in the data association process. The kinematic pattern of microbes is well modeled with the proposed integral sliding energy (ISE), which is combined with detection response in a hybrid cost function. Minimizing the cost function allows us to simultaneously select the true targets from the detections and to match the targets across two consecutive frames. Systematical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a sensor suitable for performing the spectroscopy on a localized micrometric volume of a generic liquid, in the spectral range comprised between 1 and 20&nbsp;GHz. The sensor is based on two ungrounded, open-ended coplanar waveguides, acting as Input/Output ports, with a microfluidic channel passing through them. It works by detecting the change of the reflection and transmission of microwaves due to the variation of the dielectric properties characteristic of the liquid. The devices have been designed and numerically simulated to obtain the electromagnetic response in different conditions: an empty channel for having a zero-reference response and for observing variations as a function of liquids filling the channel. We considered standard (i.e., common in literature) liquids (deionized water, ethanol, and glycerol); by means of that set of simulations we were able to start the creation of the calibration curves and defining the sensitivity of the sensor with respect to dielectric properties of the liquid under test. Then, we realized a batch of prototypes utilizing a standard photolithographic process. Later we proceeded to check the operation of the sensors. We recorded experimental data by a Vector Network Analyser connected to the devices by means of microwave probes. Sensors are designed to perform both reflection and transmission measurements on the liquid sample, and local microscopy on a micrometric volume of the solution under test. Actually, the device works avoiding any contact between the metallic parts and the liquid that can flow uncontaminated through the microfluidic channel.},

abstract = {This study presents a fuel-economical driving strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and investigates its impacts on human-driven platoon’s fuel efficiency, considering driver behavioral diversity. In mixed traffic where a limited number of CAVs and many human-driven vehicles share the road, the Eco-Driving strategy of CAVs, accomplished through vehicle connectivity and longitudinal dynamics control, can significantly reduce fuel consumption of CAVs, particularly during transient traffic conditions, by avoiding unnecessary braking and acceleration maneuvers which lead to excessive fuel consumption. This is implemented and validated by a vehicle longitudinal dynamic control design with an instantaneous power-based fuel rate estimation model. Moreover, such an Eco-Driving strategy will also help most of the following human-driven vehicles to improve fuel performance despite a highly diverse and uncertain driving characteristics spectrum. The car-following behaviors of a human-driven platoon are described by a microscopic traffic model with dedicated representations of the individual drivers’ preferences. A comprehensive statistical investigation shows the fuel-saving benefits for a human-driven platoon by adopting the proposed Eco-Driving strategy for CAVs. Some special cases are discussed, as well. The results collectively demonstrate the positive impacts of CAVs, even with a low penetration rate, could potentially have on the energy efficiency of the transportation sector within the foreseeable future.},

Therefore, the objective of the present study is to examine whether the EMF radiations affect the brain cells or not, using the transfer learning-based methodology. The observations made in the present study are based on our experiment with the Drosophila melanogaster. The microscopic brain-images of drosophila, (should be read as micro-images) exposed to and not exposed to the high-frequency EMF radiations were acquired for the analysis purposed. The comprehensive set of features were extracted from the micro-images in EMF-exposed and Non-exposed class drosophila using the pre-trained convolution neural networks (CNNs). Further, the support Vector Machine (SVM) has been used to find an optimal hyperplane in higher dimensional feature space which separates the feature representations of the micro-images from both the classes. The % accuracy of SVM in classifying the features extracted from the micro-images from both the classes using the pre-trained VGG19 network is 87.3% for the 5-fold cross-validation. The discrimination in feature sets extracted from the micro-images signifies that the EMF radiations have affected the drosophila brain cells. Experimental results reveal that the prolonged exposure to EMF radiations might have affected the drosophila brain which approves the assumed hypothesis.},

abstract = {While the science and technology of nanostructure have rapidly been developed in many fields, it is still hard to obtain sufficient samples of nano objects due to high cost, thus, impeding the development of deep learning approaches to the material fields. Here, we develop a novel approach to recognize nano objects in Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) images. First, a noise reduction method based on the Laplacian of the Gaussian(LoG) is represented to denoise the AFM images. Then, two improved methods based on the watershed algorithm are proposed to segment the overlapping objects. Finally, a CNN recognition model based on transfer learning which is pre-trained on a large scale of shapes of handwritten numbers and letters is built to recognize the nano objects in AFM images. These methods can resolve effectively the small sample problem of AFM image processing.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is defined as unregulated cell proliferation due to irreversible DNA damage. Melanoma is one kind of skin cancer generated by melanocytes, which could result in serious health issues. Early detection of this skin cancer based on image processing assist therapists in its treatment. Computational pathology has the unique capability of spatially dissecting specific interfaces on digitized histology images. The main objective of this research is to classify skin cancer using a deep learning model. This work proposes a hybrid context-aware convolutional neural network with recurrent neural network (CA-CNN-RNN) based on skin cancer histology images. This model encodes the local representation of the histological images into high-dimensional features and hence aggregates the features by considering their spatial configuration for performing final classification. The dataset for this work is made up of H&amp;E-stained images from the database of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using the hybrid CA-CNN-RNN model, the experiment on histological image of melanoma disease was performed and validated with several classification models like DarkNet-53, VGG-19, ResNet50, and Inception. The data set is utilized to evaluate the model in order to provide results, which are analyzed using parameters like as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The experimental analysis reveals that the CA-CNN-RNN performed better with the DarkNet-53 model. The proposed model achieved 97.14 accuracy, 96.49 precision, 98.21 recall, and 96.50 f-score.},

abstract = {Having summarized the previous research on ceramic identification and the anti-counterfeiting, the authors propose a ceramic identification system that combines computer vision algorithms with blockchain technology. The system uses irregular pores on microscopic images of ceramic surfaces as image features, and it applies the SIFT(Scale-invariant feature transform) algorithm to extract feature. The images and feature vector sets are then stored by IPFS(Inter-planetary File System). When a consumer needs to authenticate a ceramic product, it is only necessary to take a microscopic image of the specified location, and then the SIFT algorithm will compare the picture with the data stored in the IPFS network, and was previously obtained through the records on a blockchain network, the matching result then determines whether the photographed ceramic is one of those already recorded. Experimental show that the matching results can be used as a strong basis for identifying the origin of ceramic products.},

abstract = {In this work, it has been introduced an innovative Zn/Cu-electrochemical cell based on PKL extract and NPs. The effect of surface area of the anode, the temperature of the electrolyte and the concentration of PKL extract (electrolyte) on the current (A), voltage (V) and the power (W) of the constructed electrochemical cell has been studied. However, Nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized using PKL extract for practical applications to generate electricity. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) were produced by using KMnO4 as a precursor and Bryophyllum pinnatum leaf extract as a source of reducing agent. The XRD (X-ray diffraction) study revealed the preparation of nanocrystalline MnO2 with cubic crystal structure. The presence of capping agents on the synthesized MnO2 NPs were confirmed by the fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The surface morphology was examined with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and found to be cubic grain with homogeneous distribution. The thermal analysis was carried out using thermo gravimetric (TGA) analysis. EDX analysis demonstrates the presence of Mn and O including their composition. However, the VSM analysis indicates the ferromagnetic effect of nanoparticles. The synthesized MnO2 NPs were used in modified galvanic cell to generate electricity in which water was used as solvent. MnO2 NPs were found to be an effective material for the generation of electricity. The novelty of this work is to synthesis of MnO2 NPs using Bryophillum pinnatum leaf extract for the first time in the world. Apart from that the produced NPs have been successfully used to generate electricity in Zn/Cu based modified electrochemical cell. Most of the results have been tabulated and graphically discussed.},

abstract = {In the task of histopathological cell segmentation, traditional algorithms struggle with cell edge processing, which leads to the blurring of cell edges. To strengthen the ability to learn the features of cell edges, this paper develops a novel deep neural network for robust and fine-grained cell segmentation. The proposed deep model mines global and local features by multiscale convolution and dilated convolution. Subsequently, the residual attention module is introduced in the third to fifth layers of the encoder; this module assigns a group of weight coefficients to all the deep features to boost the segmentation performance. In addition, to further improve the quality of the features in the decoder, we first introduce the strategy of U-Net for the extraction of prior information, where we filter the fused features and compress the features by using the prior information and the filtered features again to integrate more semantic information into the feature refinement in the decoding process. We tested the model on three public data sets: Multiorgan Nucleus Segmentation (MoNuSeg) (Dice 94.9%), Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) (Dice 95.4%) and Data Science Bowl (Dice 98.2%). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in comparison with that of state-of-the-art models; our method can effectively identify cell edges to produce fine-grained segmentation results.},

abstract = {The uniformly smooth and sharp microneedles have great significance in contact spectroscopy, 3D printing, biomedical and nanotechnology. The stability, bio-stability, conductivity and mechanical properties of the gold (Au) make it effective rather than the other metals such as tungsten, copper, platinum and graphite. The surface quality, proper dimension such as the tip, cone angle is the matter of the trial and practice matter. It was the main issue to develop a controlled optimized methodology to obtain the gold needles of specific dimensions in regular and systematic way. The Ansys simulation of solid microneedle has been done to check on what stress the deflection occurs on microneedles. Then fuzzy optimization has performed to optimize the parameter of the etching set up such as the voltage, current and time of etching as an input parameter and the tip size and the conical section length as the output parameters. After the simulation and optimization the experiment of the etching has performed with the 3M solution of NaCl in deionized water and small amount of hydropercaloric acid. The fabricated needles have been then characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe the morphology and the dimensions. The fuzzy analysis has been performed for optimization of the inputs voltage of range 1–10volt, current of range 1–100 mA and etching times from 1–15minutes. These optimized values are calculated by the fuzzy analysis such as the voltage is 58.6 mA, etching time 15 minutes and the voltages found to be 10 volt. Fuzzy analysis gives the simulated size of the tip 10.6μm and Mamdani models gives the 10.7μm which have the 0.01% error and the cone length for the Mamdani was found to be 500μm and the simulated values 497 having the 0.03% error which have very close approximation with the experimental values from the SEM micrographs that which also gives the values of the cone length from 400–500μm and the tip size from 10-20μm for the time 10-15minute whose values was optimized by the fuzzy analysis.},

The abnormal sperm cells cannot provide successful result in artificial fertilization. Nowadays the assessment of morphology of sperm cells is subjective and error prone hence creating automatic evaluation method for morphology assessment, it will improve the success ratio in infertility treatment. The first step in our proposed system is pre-processing where noise removal process is applied on microscopic medical images. In second step, adaptive alpha valued Havrda-Chavrat entropy-based threshold technique is proposed where the maximum probability distribution of foreground pixels or background pixels is assigned to alpha value. Further, existing state-of-art threshold-based segmentation methods are implemented and obtained results on the input images. These segmentation results are compared with the proposed method in terms of supervised and unsupervised evaluation metrics, in which our proposed thresholding method has given optimum threshold value for the segmentation of spermatozoa cells. The outcome of the segmented images and their metric values are indicating better segmentation by our proposed method. Furthermore, this proposed method can be implemented in the mobile applications for diagnosis with artificial intelligence techniques.},

abstract = {In situ laser heating with transmission electron microscopy (ILH-TEM) is utilized as a neoteric method to probe the thermal behavior and stability of metal- (Pt, Au-) metal oxide (Fe3O4) heterodimer (HD) nanoparticles. Two different supporting membrane types are used for the laser heating: pure-carbon and silicon-nitride, requiring different amounts of laser power to induce morphological changes. Diffraction pattern analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are utilized to analyze reduction of the iron oxide under laser heating, which has differing effects depending on the support film heating mode and the heterodimer particle. A unique wetting behavior of Pt and Au onto Fe3O4 is observed in both heterodimers of Au and Pt. However, this wetting behavior is found to be partially reversible only in the case of the Au-Fe3O4 HD system, whereas for the Pt-Fe3O4 HD system, this wetting process was found to be irreversible under the applied experimental conditions. This observation of a novel wetting behavior has future implications for understanding the performance of oxide supported metal nanoparticles in high temperature applications, such as catalysis.},

abstract = {Aluminium matrix composites (AMCs) are broadly used to change the monolithic materials in aviation, automotive, and defense industries owing to their superior characteristics such as specific strength with light weight, greater hardness, good wear resistance, and better thermal properties. This novel work was aimed at estimating the specific wear rate (SWR) of zirconium dioxide- (ZrO2-) filled AA8011 (Al-Fe-Si alloy) matrix composites. A Taguchi method and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to find out the optimum range of control parameters on SWR of proposed composites. The stir casting technique was used to fabricate the composite specimens with varying proportions (5, 10, and 15 wt.%) of ZrO2 particle addition. The wear tests were performed as per L27 orthogonal design by using a pin-on-disk apparatus under dry conditions. For this test, four control parameters such as wt.% of ZrO2, load, disc velocity, and sliding distance each at three levels were selected. Based on the experimental results, 15 wt.% of ZrO2, 29.43 N of load, 0.94 m/s of disc velocity, and 1000 m of sliding distance provide the minimum SWR of the developed composite sample. ANOVA result revealed that the load (49.04%) was the primary dominant factor for affecting the SWR, followed by wt.% of ZrO2 content (29.24%), respectively. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed to study the wear mechanism of worn-out surface of the composite test specimens.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common invading cancers in women. Analyzing breast cancer is nontrivial and may lead to disagreements among experts. Although deep learning methods achieved an excellent performance in classification tasks including breast cancer histopathological images, the existing state-of-the-art methods are computationally expensive and may overfit due to extracting features from in-distribution images. In this paper, our contribution is mainly twofold. First, we perform a short survey on deep-learning-based models for classifying histopathological images to investigate the most popular and optimized training-testing ratios. Our findings reveal that the most popular training-testing ratio for histopathological image classification is 70%: 30%, whereas the best performance (e.g., accuracy) is achieved by using the training-testing ratio of 80%: 20% on an identical dataset. Second, we propose a method named DenTnet to classify breast cancer histopathological images chiefly. DenTnet utilizes the principle of transfer learning to solve the problem of extracting features from the same distribution using DenseNet as a backbone model. The proposed DenTnet method is shown to be superior in comparison to a number of leading deep learning methods in terms of detection accuracy (up to 99.28% on BreaKHis dataset deeming training-testing ratio of 80%: 20%) with good generalization ability and computational speed. The limitation of existing methods including the requirement of high computation and utilization of the same feature distribution is mitigated by dint of the DenTnet.},

abstract = {In this work, the zinc/cobalt-based zeolite imidazolate frameworks ((Co/Zn)ZIFs) were synthesized with the solvothermal method. The obtained material was characterized by utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. XRD and SEM analyses show that (Co/Zn)ZIFs are composed of nanocrystals with polyhedral shapes of around 50–100 nm and belong to the I-43m space group as those of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67. Optical studies demonstrate a red shift in the absorbance spectrum of (Co/Zn)ZIFs compared with individual components of ZIF-67 or ZIF-8. (Co/Zn)ZIF composite was utilized as photocatalytic material to treat a model aqueous solution containing rhodamine B and bacteria. It was found that (Co/Zn)ZIFs could simultaneously degrade rhodamine B and inhibit bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus). The manufactured composite could catalyze the mineralization of rhodamine B and also exhibited good antibacterial activity against Gram-negative E. coli (93.32% inhibition rate) and Gram-positive S. aureus (90.86% inhibition rate) in the visible-light region within four hours of irradiation. Gram-negative bacteria were more resistant to (Co/Zn)ZIFs than Gram-positive bacteria. (Co/Zn)ZIFs can be used as light-driven catalysts for water and environmental detoxification from organic compounds like dyes and bacteria.},

This study was planned to find the potential of Carduus edelbergii Rech.f. extract for the fabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and their subsequent antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, and antioxidant activities. The prepared plant extract was analyzed for phytochemicals, elements, and nutrients. The fabricated AgNPs were characterized by spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The synthesized AgNPs and the Carduus edelbergii extract were investigated for their antioxidant, antibacterial, cytotoxic, and antifungal characteristics. The results showed that the plant extract contains a wide range of important nutrients and secondary metabolites. The synthesized AgNPs were crystalline and globular with an average diameter of 36.5 nm and exhibited a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak at roughly 420 nm. As compared to Carduus edelbergii extract, the phytofabricated AgNPs had an increased antioxidant and cytotoxic efficacy. The AgNPs showed substantial antibacterial action against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella aerogenes and Escherichia coli) bacteria. The findings revealed that the phytofabricated AgNPs could be an effective antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal for treatment of medical conditions.},

To increase the morphological area and improve the proficiency of the photocatalytic technique, sodium alginate was used as a polymeric tool and arranged as drop practice. SiO2 nanoparticles were doped into sodium alginate droplets. The developed SiO2 nanomaterials were able to spread the wavelength diversity throughout a significant wavelength constituency. In the photocatalytic technique employing the lot photoreactor, MB was used as a sample of carbon-based pollutants. The sunlight catalytic procedure was implemented from UV-Vis or photo light droplets. The analysis of the synthesized droplets was tested using devices X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and photoluminescence (PL) analysis. Correspondingly, the influences of different concentrations of SiO2 nanosolution (5 ml, 10 ml, 15 ml, and 20 ml) on the photocatalytic effectiveness of the deposited nanoparticles were studied. The output result revealed that sodium alginate beads doped with SiO2 at 20 ml were able to reduce (degrade) 98.9% underneath UV-visible light. However, in the case of using other concentrations, SiO2 at 5, 10, and 15 ml were able to degrade 50%, 56.7%, and 67.9% under sunlight, respectively, after 2 h.},

The AgNPs have been used as functional nanofillers in the manufacture of carrageenan-based functional nanocomposite films. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) confirmed that AgNPs were uniformly dispersed in the carrageenan polymer matrix. The addition of AgNPs to the Carr film affected the surface color, mechanical, water vapor barrier, and surface wettability properties and significantly improved the UV blocking properties of the nanocomposite films. In addition, the carrageenan/AgNP composite films showed strong antioxidant activity and potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli O157: H7) bacteria. The carrageenan/AgNP film with UV protection, antioxidant, and antibacterial activity can be used as active food packaging material to extend the shelf life of packaged food.},

abstract = {Aluminium metal matrix nanocomposites (AMMNCs) have been recognized as a promising material with excellent structural and functional characteristics that can be suggestively personalized to satisfy industrial demands as well as design requirements for a wide range of applications, including those in defense, marine, automobiles, and aerospace. Particularly, these industries are using an increasing number of components manufactured by AMMNCs. When compared to monolithic materials, components manufactured from aluminium-based composites have better qualities such as tribological behaviors, hardness, stiffness, strength, and higher strength to weight ratio. Therefore, this article addresses the experimental investigation on aluminium-based metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) with silicon carbide (SiC) and fly ash (FA) as a reinforcement material with distinct ratios. Here aluminium alloy 6061 and 7075, hereafter referred as AA6061 and AA7075, are considered as base material. The final workpieces obtained using the process of stir casting and machining are tested to compute the output response parameters like yield strength (YS), wear rate (WR), hardness, impact strength (IS), and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). In addition, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images also studied for examining the distribution of reinforcement material particles in base metal.},

The test specimens are then machined from the cast aluminum metal matrix composites. The tests are carried out utilizing an ASTM G99-compliant pin-on-plate tribometer on a pivoting EN32 circle. Minitab 16 is used to plan the dry sliding wear trials, which are set up in an orthogonal array. The input parameters are percent HBN addition and CBN addition, sliding speed, and load, and the wear rate was considered to be the output parameter. The actual density of the cast specimens was found to be greater than 90% of their theoretical density. The accumulation of HBN and CBN greatly enhances the wear resistance of aluminum metal matrix composites, according to research. The technique of regression analysis is utilized to establish genuine links between the wear rate and input parameters. The morphology of the worn out surfaces was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

Different ratios of chitosan to gum (1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 3, v/v) and CS to PE (1 : 0.5, 1 : 1, and 1 : 1.5, v/v) were studied to evaluate the nanocapsule properties. The results showed that the capsules entrapping the PE were successfully created with an encapsulation efficiency (EE %) of more than 80% via the ionic gelation method. The ratio of chitosan : gums and CS : PE was affecting both the encapsulation efficiency and capsule size. The capsules’ spherical shape and nanometer size were confirmed using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The relative ratios 1 : 1 of CS : CG and 1 : 0.5 of CS : PE gave the highest EE% (89.27%) with an average capsule size of 70 nm, whereas the maximum EE% with AG was 97.39% with a mean size of 50 nm at the CS : PE ratio of 1 : 0.5 and AG : CS ratio of 1 : 2. The release profile of PE from the CS-CG matrix during 240 min under acidic and alkaline conditions was about 94.45% and 98.53%, respectively, and that from the CS-AG matrix was about 25.54% and 19.49%, respectively. The FTIR spectra confirmed the electrostatic interactions between the protonated amino group of chitosan (-NH3+) and carboxylic ions (−COO−) of the gums. These findings indicated that the CS-CG could be used as an efficient and ecofriendly coating material for nanoencapsulation of PE.},

In order to generate lighter, more efficient materials for specific purposes, research has migrated away from traditional materials and alloys and toward composite materials in current years. Blended microbially nanocomposite that takes advantage of organic flax fibres and nanoreinforced biobased polymers can increase characteristics while keeping the environment in mind. Adding aluminium trihydride (ATH) powder to the natural resin allows it to sustain rigidity without compromising toughness while increasing barrier and mechanical characteristics. Investigation of several composite samples confirmed this positive effect, with systems that contain 10% epoxidized methyl soyate (EMS) and 2.5 wt.% ATH maintains the original resin’s rigidity, strain to fracture, and hygromechanical characteristics while enhancing toughness. Mechanical testing like interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was found per the standard ASTM testing method. Among the various combinations, the second combinations (77.5 wt.% polyester, 2.5 wt.% ATH, and 20 wt.% of flax fibre) provide the highest value of ILSS (34.31 MPa). Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the fractured surface of the nanocomposites and the degree of dispersion of the ATH filler.},

abstract = {Objective. In order to find the best process for the preparation of Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles in the laboratory, the preparation of Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles was optimized using the central composite design method. In order to investigate the properties of the prepared Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles, physicochemical properties were examined and in vitro dissolution experiments were performed, and the pharmacokinetics of Chrysophanol and Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles were investigated in rabbits. Methods. In the preexperimental study, the best physical solubilization method and organic solvent for Chrysophanol were selected. The ratio of drug dosage to excipient dosage and the amount of organic solvents were evaluated by single-factor test. Based on the single-factor test, the optimal prescription was obtained by screening the formulation and optimizing the preparation process using the central composite design method with the encapsulation efficiency as the index. Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles were prepared according to the optimal prescription, and their particle size, potential, appearance, and in vitro release experiments were carried out. Chrysophanol and Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles were injected intravenously through the ear margins to rabbits, and the drug concentrations in the blood were measured at different time points by HPLC. The obtained blood concentration data were fitted with PK Solver 2.0 program to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters. Results. In the preexperimental study, ultrasonic method was selected as the physical solubilization method, and acetone was selected as the organic solvent. In single-factor test, the highest encapsulation efficiency was achieved when the ratio of drug dosage to excipient dosage was 1 : 15; the highest encapsulation efficiency was achieved when the amount of organic solvent (acetone) was 8 mL. The equation fitted to the model for the optimized prescription by the central composite design method is as follows: R1=−166.93629+16.86478A+32.55582B−0.169750AB−0.4826752−2.25797B2R2=0.9457. The best prescription for the preparation of Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles was obtained in the ratio of drug dosage to excipient dosage of 1 : 16.309 and the dosage of organic solvent was 6.595 mL. The prepared nanomicelles have a particle size of 152.8 nm and a potential of -23.9 mV. It was observed by transmission electron microscope that the prepared nanomicelles are uniform and spherical in appearance. The drug metabolism of Chrysophanol and nanomicelles in rabbits conforms to the two-compartment open model, and both of them show linear kinetics in the drug dose range. T1/2α was 0.31±0.21 h and 0.47±0.35 h, and T1/2β was 2.06±1.14 h and 7.72±2.04 h for Chrysophanol and Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles, respectively. Conclusions. The adopted central composite design method can well optimize the prescription process of Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles prepared by dialysis, and the method is simple and easy to be prepared in the laboratory. The prepared nanomicelles have uniform particle size and good zeta potential and appear as uniform black spherical shape under transmission electron microscopy. In vitro release studies showed that the Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles released significantly better than Chrysophanol. The results of pharmacokinetics of Chrysophanol and Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles in rabbits showed that the Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles did not change the metabolic process of the drug in vivo but could stay in vivo for a longer period of time and exert longer effects. It is hoped that this study can provide a laboratory basis for the preparation of Chrysophanol-Pluronic F127 nanomicelles and a reference for further in vivo studies of Chrysophanol.},

To control this disease, various chemical fungicides have been used till date which are harmful to our environment. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles synthesized from Terminalia bellerica have been reported to have significant antifungal potential against A. brassicae at 200 ppm concentration. In the present study, the effect of green synthesized zinc oxide (Tb-ZnO) nanoparticles, chemically synthesized ZnO nanoparticles, and chemical fungicides on A. brassicae has been anticipated by analysing changes in cytomorphology characteristics, biochemical constituent, and stress enzymes of A. brassicae. Cytomorphological studies by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy have shown the complete disintegration of cell wall, cell membrane, and cytoplasmic content at 200 ppm concentration of Tb-ZnO nanoparticles. Decrement in biochemical constituents and changes in activity of stress enzymes in Tb-ZnO nanoparticles treated cell confirm the toxicity of nanoparticles at 200 ppm concentrations. Hence, on the basis of all these results, the mechanism of action of Tb-ZnO nanofungicides on A. brassicae has been hypothesized in the present study. This study confirms how nanoparticles inhibit the growth of A. brassicae and suggested the use of nanofungicides.},

The prognostic role of CRP (C-reactive protein) in gynecological tumors has been previously reported in individual studies, but whether CRP can be used as a separate potential prognostic factor has not been systematically reviewed. The purpose of this research is to determine if there is a link between CRP levels and the prognosis of gynecological cancer patients. Methods. A systematic search was carried out to find the literature evaluating the predictive role of CRP in the prognosis of gynecological cancer patients. For the purpose of determining the relationship between CRP and clinicopathological characteristics, the pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated. A hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to determine differences in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), or progression-free survival (PFS) between patients with low and high CRP levels. Results. A total of 19 studies, including 4062 patients, were analyzed retrospectively. The FIGO stage was related to the CRP level (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.19–1.00). Age, lymph node metastasis, and histological grade were not associated with CRP level (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.69–1.25; OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.65–1.28; OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.52–1.05). Worse OS (HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.23–1.57), DFS (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.12–1.28), and PFS (HR = 1.57, 95%CI: 1.23–1.91) were associated with elevated CRP levels, as shown by the pooled results. Subgroup analysis was performed according to cancer type (endometrial cancer: HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02–1.28; ovarian cancer: HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.03–2.31; cervical cancer: HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.19–1.64), multivariate value (HR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10–1.33), and age (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.28–1.72). Significant correlations were observed between CRP and OS. Conclusions. CRP may be utilized as a prognostic indicator for a variety of gynecologic malignancies, including cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and vulvar cancer.},

In this regard, ZrO2-CeO2 nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized through the Scanning Electron Microscope and Powder X-ray diffraction methods followed by the preparation of hybrid ZrO2-CeO2 nanofluids of various concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 0.1%. The heat transfer features of a tubular heat pipe with a mixture of the ZrO2-CeO2 nanofluid were evaluated. A 5.33% decrease in thermal resistance value and a 41.16% increase in heat transfer ability with increased power input were observed. The potent regression models were proposed to estimate heat transfer features of the heat pipe. The ANOVA statistical method has been employed to determine the P value and the F value of the models towards enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the developed models. The outcome revealed that the proposed models are reliable and have the best fit with the experimental data for 30–60 W power. The correlations’ results were validated against the experimental data and showed high accuracy. Moreover, the accuracy of the developed models was ensured through R-squared and adjusted R-squared values.},

Antimony doping, aluminum, and antimony codoping with 2.0 percent were used to make these films. The impact of doped and codoped films on structural, optical properties, and morphological has been examined using a variety of characterization approaches. A ZnO nanocrystal with a diameter of 20-30 nm was discovered using XRD (X-ray diffraction). According to SEM (scanning electron microscope) scans, the grain size is in the 80-120 nm region. The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to detect elemental elements was studied, and the peak at 400-520 cm-1 was identified as ZnO. The optical properties of doped and codoped ZnO were checked, and it was discovered that antimony-doped ZnO has a larger band gap than Al and antimony-codoped ZnO. This proved that ZnO may be used in gas sensors and solar cells. The gas response of a static gas sensor system based on Sb-doped films was measured and compared to Al- and Sb-codoped films in the presence of ethanol vapor.},

abstract = {In recent times, research has shifted away from conventional materials and alloys and more towards nanocomposites to create lighter, more efficient materials for specific applications. The major goal of this research is to see how successful adding aluminium tetrahydride (ATH) filler to a luffa fibre/polyester-based hybrid composite is. The compression moulding process was used to create the nanocomposite. The following limitations were used to achieve the goals mentioned above: (i) weight percent of ATH, (ii) weight percent of luffa fibres, and (iii) cryogenic treatment hours. The mechanical properties of the materials, such as flexural, tensile, and impact, were examined. The scanning electron microscope observed the morphology pictures, revealing flaws such as interface behaviour, fibre pullouts, voids, and interior cracks. As a result, the current study found that adding nanofiller to a natural fibre composite can improve its mechanical properties, because it established a strong link between the matrix and its reinforcements, which would aid in the effective transmission of stress in the hybrid system. It also improved moisture resistance, which might be useful in construction and commercial industries. The composite with 1 wt.% of ATH, 24 wt.% of luffa fibres, and 30 minutes of cryogenic treatment showed better mechanical strength. Cryogenic treatment reduces compressive interface stresses, which helps maintain fibre and matrix in contact and improve adhesion, resulting in superior results. TGA analysis was used to confirm it.},

abstract = {Magnetic nanoparticles have gained huge importance in the last ten years. They have found tremendous applications in the field of medicine, electronics, and environmental cleanup. The synthesis of amorphous iron oxide nanoparticles (AIONPs) is expensive making its applications highly overpriced. This research study reports the synthesis of AIONPs from waste incense sticks ash (ISA) in two steps. The first step is the recovery of ferrous fractions from ISA, followed by concentrated HCl treatment of magnetic fraction along with ultrasonication. And the second step includes treatment of ferrous-rich leachate with sodium hydroxides. The size of synthesized AIONPs varied from 40-90 nm and were highly aggregated due to the formation of large clumps. Cytotoxicity of synthesized AIONPs was determined on a normal human lung (BEAS-2B) cell line by using an MTT assay. Data showed that AIONPs induced cell toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. The particles were mainly spherical to rod-shaped and highly aggregated, it was confirmed by the microscopy analysis. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy revealed the Fe-O, Si-O-Al as major functional groups in the AIONPs, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the amorphicity and physical property measurement system (PPMS) revealed the magnetic strength of the synthesized AIONPs. Finally, the AIONPs particles were applied for the remediation of Congo red dye from the wastewater by the adsorption method, and about 72% removal was achieved after one hour. The utilization of such ISA waste, for the synthesis of value-added minerals and their utilization for environmental cleanup, makes this whole process cost-efficient and environment-friendly.},

abstract = {Currently, plant templated synthesis of magnetite iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) was emerged for multifunctional purposes. In this study, the leaf extract of the plant Thymus schimperi was utilized to synthesize Fe3O4 NPs. The synthesized NPs were characterized by using technical tools such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (TGA-DTA). The XRD result corroborated the presence of desired phase formation having pure cubic face centered phase structure with average crystallite particle size ranging from 20 nm to 30 nm. SEM micrographs confirmed microstructural homogeneities and remarkably different morphology of Fe3O4 NPs. Mercury (II) and chromium (VI) removal efficiencies of Fe3O4 NPs were found to be 90% and 86% from aqueous solution at initial concentration of 20 mg/L, respectively. Various factors which affect the metal ion removal efficiency such as metal ion initial concentrations, pH, contact time, and adsorbent dosage were also studied. The optimum pH and contact time for chromium ion adsorption were pH 5 and 60 min and that of mercury were observed to be pH 7 and 90 min, respectively. The Langmuir isotherm was best fitted for sorption of Hg(II) ion, and the Freundlich isotherm was best fitted with sorption of Cr(VI) ion onto the surface of Fe3O4 NPs. The mechanism of adsorption of both Hg(II) and Cr(VI) ions was obeyed pseudo 2nd order kinetics. The recorded percent removal efficiencies revealed that these Fe3O4 NPs synthesized through leaf extract of the plant called Thymus schimperi have demonstrated excellent potentiality in the remediation of heavy metal ions. The synthesized Fe3O4 NPs were regenerated (reused) for adsorptive removal of Hg(II) and Cr(VI) for five consecutive cycles without significant loss of removal efficiency. Fe3O4 NPs were reused with only 4.17% loss of removal efficiency against Hg(II) and only 3% loss of removal efficiency against Cr(VI) metal ions.},

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) analyses were used to investigate the characteristics of blend films.

XG-PHB blend of ratio 80 : 20 showed the highest tensile strength and was subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The results revealed that the XG-PHB blend has a lower melting point (121.3°C) and lesser crystalline degree (17.26%) than PHB. TGA results showed that blend film was more thermally stable than PHB.

In this study, the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by advanced techniques such as UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis. The biological activities of these synthesized nanoparticles were examined in vitro by measuring the enzymatic inhibition potential on urease and carbonic anhydrase and in vivo by determining the analgesic and sedative activities. The UV spectrum indicated various peaks at the range of 530-550 nm, showing nanoparticles formation. The FT-IR spectroscopy of the extracts and AuNPs indicated the presence of NH, C═N, and N═O in the extract involved in the nanoparticles synthesis. The size of nanoparticles was determined by AFM analysis. The AFM showed that the nanoparticles range from 10 to 100 nm and are almost spherical in shape. The synthesized AuNPs exhibited significant urease inhibition potential with an IC50 value of 44.98. Similarly, the nanoparticles exhibited good carbonic anhydrase inhibition with an IC50 value of 53.54 against acetazolamide having IC50 0.13. Pistacia chinensis extract and its AuNPs exhibited excellent attenuation p&lt;0.01 in acetic acid-induced writhing model at a dose of 15 mg/kg.

abstract = {Piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials are widely used in various types of microelectronics due to their excellent mechanical and electrical coupling characteristics. In recent years, piezoelectric force microscopy has developed into a powerful tool for analyzing nanoscale ferroelectric materials. However, quantitative analysis based on PFM is difficult to properly study it. This article studies the related issues of PFM quantitative analysis. First, the relationship between the effective piezoelectric coefficient and piezoelectric coefficient of different materials is analyzed from the PFM nanometer scale to analyze the force-electric coupling effect. The study found that the effective piezoelectric coefficient is closely related to the intrinsic electroelastic constant of the material. Secondly, the analysis of the nanoscale piezoelectric deformation of ferroelectric materials shows that under the conductive SPM probe, as the clustering with the probe increases, the in-plane displacement first increases and then decreases, and the out-of-plane displacement gradually decreases. Finally, the half-width region of the nanoscale ferroelectric response domain was analyzed by PFM. Taking the in-plane and out-of-plane domains of 180° and 90° domains as examples, the relationship between the response boundary domain and the tip radius was analyzed, and the results showed that whether the PFM can effectively solve the problem of detection and analysis depends on the half-width of the response boundary domain, and the resolution of the vertical PFM is higher than that of the lateral PFM.},

Here, we present a series of indium arsenide quantum dot layers grown using several bismuth fluxes and two different growth temperatures. The effects of bismuth flux on quantum dot morphology and optical properties are studied by atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence measurements. Bimodal distributions of quantum dots are seen at low growth temperature, while at high temperature, a single dominant distribution is seen in most of the layers. A medium bismuth flux was seen to produce the highest integrated photoluminescence intensity at high growth temperature, whereas intensity saturates between medium and high fluxes at low growth temperatures. A significant increase in uncorrected aspect ratio seen for the layer grown with a low bismuth flux at high growth temperature presents a new opportunity for control of quantum dot morphology using bismuth.},

abstract = {Combining two types of fibers may aid in improving the fundamental properties of organic fiber-reinforced hybrid polymeric materials. Biomaterials created from raw materials are gaining appeal in the industrial sector due to their high quality, as well as sustainability and environmental considerations. Natural fiber-reinforced hybrid nanocomposites were created in this work using a compression moulding technique with wood particles, hemp fiber, polypropylene, and montmorillonite nanoclay. Following that, the impacts of fiber mixture and vermiculite on mechanical and compostable qualities were studied. Both the coir and the hemp fibers were alkali-treated to minimize their hydrophilic nature before even being employed. Using universal tensile testing equipment, the mechanical characteristics of the prepared composites were investigated and found to be improved following fiber blending and nanoparticle inclusion. The maximum strength was occurred at the combinations like 10 wt. % of wood particle, hemp, nanoclay, and 70% of polypropylene matrix. Scanning electron microscopy showed that nanoclay significantly increased the adherence and interoperability between fiber and the polymer matrices. The good biocompatibility and water absorption capabilities of the nanocomposite were increased by mixing fibers, but nanoparticle additions seemed to have the opposite impact.},

Its physicochemical characteristics have a substantial body of evidence. The in vivo antioxidant effect of Mosul’s hot springs in Iraq has been investigated in the current investigation. An experimental design for toxicity, a control group, and a study group were created. In addition, in vivo antioxidant effect of the hot springs of Mosul, Iraq, has been studied by the lipid antiperoxidation method with (p&lt;0.05), in vitro by the free radical scavenging method (DPPH) for its complexing capacity of hot springs. In acute oral toxicity in vivo at fixed doses, looking for signs and symptoms of toxicity, there are no signs of intoxication or significant changes in the biochemical analysis (blood count). And, it was discovered that the variances are substantial. The animal was necropsied, and hematological and biochemical parameters were determined, as well as the organs’ histological processing at the study’s conclusion. It was found that the thermal waters from Mosul, Iraq, are medicinal mineral waters, chlorinated, sodium, and sulfated, nontoxic and have an antioxidant effect. With the help of the research’s findings, it is hoped to provide scientific support for knowledge that, when made public, encourages the development of Mosul’s hot springs as a safe and environmentally friendly tourist destination. With the results of this research, the parameters were presented with their mean and standard deviation statistics, promoting the ecological and sanitary tourism development of the Mosul hot springs, which will generate more significant income for the population, therefore growth in the region.},

The main purpose of this experimental research is to evaluate the biomechanical and geomorphologic belongings of nanostructured substance under naturalistic situations. To accomplish such a cognitive approach, flaxseed strands are employed as reinforcing, nano-based graphene as an additive, and epoxy as a matrix phase, with the following restrictions in imagination: (i) fiber lengths, (ii) fiber volume fraction, and (iii) weight proportions of nanoparticles. The nanocomposites are combined by means of the hand lay-up process based on the Taguchi orthogonal specification. The material characteristics of the substance, like bending, tension, and shock characteristics, are assessed in line with the standard specification. The material properties of mixtures’ second levels are the highest when compared to all other configurations. The elastic modulus of nanoparticle biocomposites revealed that 2% graphene provides 32.39 percent, 4% graphene provides 36.39 percent, and 6% nanoparticle pertains to 31.23 percent. Fractured images captured using scanning electron microscope of cracked samples have been used to comprehend the overall failure mechanism of a composite in mechanical characterization.},

abstract = {In this study, gold nanostars (AuNSs) were prepared by a facile and environmentally friendly method through the one-step reduction process with collagen as the stabilizing agent. The use of collagen, a highly biocompatible protein with many functional amines groups, can facilitate the simultaneous controlled synthesis and surface protecting of gold nanoparticles in one step. This synthetic process was operated in the aqueous solution of tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) at room temperature, in which ascorbic acid serves as a reductive agent. The influence of collagen concentration (0.02-0.06 mM) on the morphology of AuNSs was carefully studied to clarify its dual roles as stabilizing and controlling agents for the growth of the particles. Besides that, by simply adjusting reaction components such as the molar ratio of ascorbic acid to HAuCl4 and pH value, the length of the AuNS tips was also controlled. This study could offer a novel modified approach in the controlled synthesis process of AuNSs with the biomolecules collagen. The resulting AuNSs were then characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), zeta potential, Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and circular dichroism (CD), as well as selected area electron diffraction (SAED). UV-Vis spectroscopy showed the formation of AuNSs with the maximum surface plasmon resonance peak at 600-639 nm. TEM results revealed that the average particle size of the AuNSs stabilized by the collagen ranged from 27.39 nm to 41.55 nm, depending on the experimental composition and the pH values. HRTEM, EDS, and SAED results prove a more precise insight into the formation of pure gold nanocrystals. Analysis of the current results may also help better understand the growth mechanism of AuNSs during the synthesis process in the presence of collagen. The Au concentration quantified by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique after separating and decomposing with microwave-assisted digestion exhibits that the synthesis of AuNSs has a high yield of 88.62%. Additionally, the colloidal stability of AuNS-collagen against different NaCl concentrations, pH, temperatures, and storage time was also examined through UV-Vis spectroscopy. The investigation results reveal that AuNS-collagen remains stable in NaCl 2.0% (w/v), from mildly acidic to neutral pH (4-7), below the temperature of 40°C, and within 21 days postsynthesis. The AuNS synthesized by this eco-friendly method is promising for many potential applications in biomedical field.},

The obtained low-intensity bands of fingerprint region bands (612 cm-1) and aromatic OH bands (3385 cm-1) are identified that the reduction of silver ions (Ag+) into metallic silver (Ag0) nanoparticles. Further, the charge, size, and morphology of the synthesized EG-AgNPs were studied using various spectroscopic methods including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM), FESEM-EDX elemental mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The notable efficacy of the EG-AgNPs in antimicrobial activity including minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) suggested the EG-AgNPs are noteworthy material for biomedical applications. EG-AgNPs exhibited an efficient photocatalytic activity by degrading environmental pollutants, methylene blue (MB), and methyl orange (MO) dyes. The antioxidant property by radical scavenging (DPPH) assay of synthesized AgNPs was studied. Furthermore, the studied antioxidant behavior of EG-AgNPs by DPPH assay strongly supports that the EG-AgNPs are highly suitable materials for anticancer agents.},

abstract = {Watermarking is one of the most common techniques used to protect data’s authenticity, integrity, and security. The obfuscation in the frequency domain used in the watermarking method makes the watermarking stronger than the obfuscation in the spatial domain. It occupies an important place in watermarking works in imperceptibility, capacity, and robustness. Finding the optimal location to hide the watermarking is one of the most challenging tasks in these methods and affects the method’s performance. In this article, sample identification information is processed with the method of watermaking on the hiding environment created by using a chaos-based random number generator on biomedical data to provide solutions to problems such as visual attack, identity theft, and information confusion. In order to obtain biomedical data, a lensless digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) setup was designed, and holographic data of human blood and cancer cell lines, which are widely used in the laboratory environment, were obtained. The standard USAF 1951 target was used to evaluate the resolution of our imaging setup. Various QR codes were generated for medical sample identification, and the captured medical data were processed by watermarking it with chaos-based random number generators. A new method using chaos-based discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) has been developed and applied to high-resolution data to eliminate the problem of encrypted data being directly targeted by third-party attacks. The performance of the proposed new watermarking method has been demonstrated by various robustness and invisibility tests. Experimental results showed that the proposed scheme reached an average PSNR value of 564588 dB and SSIM value of 0.9972 against several geometric and destructive attacks, which means that the proposed method does not affect the image quality and also ensures the security of the watermarking information. The results of the proposed method have shown that it can be used efficiently in various fields.},

The study aims to identify whether the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-derived lncRNA MALAT1 participates in the inflammation of pancreatic cell and its potential mechanism. Methods. The NAFLD cell model was constructed by treating HepG2 cells with FFA. The in vitro model of acute pancreatitis (AP) was established by the administration of caerulein on AR42J cells. MALAT1 and si-MALAT1 were transfected into pancreatic cells, and then exosomes were collected from the NAFLD cell model and then were cocultured with AR42J cells. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of exosomes. Oil Red O staining was applied to reveal the lipid deposition. The triglyceride, IL-6, and TNF-α levels were detected using ELISA. The MALAT1 level in exosomes was detected by qRT-PCR. The CD9, CD63, CD81, and CYP2E1, LC3II, and LC3I levels were detected by western blot. Results. MALAT1 was upregulated in NAFLD-derived exosomes and increased the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in pancreatic cells. NAFLD-derived exosomes inhibited YAP phosphorylation, decreased the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, and reduced the ratio of LC3II/LC3I protein in pancreatic cells. Silencing MALAT1 significantly returned the inhibitory effect of NAFLD on hippo-YAP pathway. YAP1 signal transduction inhibitor CA3 reversed the decrease of LC3II/LC3I expression and the increase of IL-6 and TNF-α levels induced by MALAT1 in the AP cell model. Conclusions. NAFLD-derived MALAT1 exacerbates pancreatic cell inflammation via inhibiting autophagy by upregulating YAP.},

Properties such as the surface structure, hydrophilicity, and roughness of the implanted materials can modulate monocyte–macrophage function. In this study, we characterized material-hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes (H-TNT) with superhydrophilic surfaces to investigate the effect of H-TNT on macrophage polarization and osseointegration. H-TNT were prepared by anodic oxidation and hydrogenation and used in the experimental group, while TNT and smooth pure Ti were employed in the control groups. RAW264.7 cells were selected to observe the immunomodulatory effect of these samples. The cell morphology was observed via scanning electron microscopy, and cytokine expression was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence staining. After 24 hr of cultivation, the macrophage-conditioned medium was collected and used for indirect coculture with MC3T3-E1 cells. The morphology of MC3T3-E1 cells was observed using fluorescence staining. Cell adhesion and proliferation were measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Alkaline phosphatase activity measurement, alizarin red staining, calcium quantification, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed to assess the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. The results showed that H-TNT promoted the M2-type polarization of macrophages, which in turn influenced the adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. These materials can serve as useful candidates for bone implants because they activate macrophages to produce a favorable osteoimmunomodulatory microenvironment.},

The nanoparticles of binary compound CdSe were also grown at different concentrations of sodium selenosulfite, and the influence of this parameter on the behaviours of the nanoparticles was studied. The as-synthesized cadmium selenide nanoparticles are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and PL absorption spectroscopy. Cadmium-selenide nanoparticles were produced using various concentrations as 10, 15, and 20 milliliters on a microscopic glass plate by chemical technique at a growth temperature of 90 degree Celsius. Microstructural constraints realized from the X-ray diffraction pattern decrease in grain size with an increase of concentration (8.25 nm–0.01 nm). It witnessed that the synthesized nanoparticle has a cubic crystal structure with favoured direction towards the (111) Miller indices’ plane. The oriented peak was investigated from the planes (311) and (111). From patterns of PL emissions, it was detected that in increasing concentration of sodium selenosulfate intensity, the nanoparticles with small crystal size could represent maximum luminescence intensity associated with the larger crystal size. This is due to the fact that the amount of ions on the nanoparticle surface rapidly increases as the crystal size of the nanoparticles reduces. Additionally, the transporter recombination ratio was increased as the size of the transporter reduces resulting in an increase in the overlap between the electron and hole wave functions. SEM inspection of produced nanoparticles reveals that the surface is free of cracks and that the grains are spherically formed. The surface is coated with granules of consistent size and shape. There are no fractures or holes visible inside the thin films under examination.},

abstract = {Sonochemical synthesis was used to create novel solar light active Mg-doped CuO nanoparticles. Through a chemical impregnation method, the produced nanomaterial was changed with PVA (polyvinylalcohol). The optical properties, crystal structure, and surface morphologies of the synthesized nanomaterials were probed by UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis-DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and BET specific surface area studies. The prepared nanomaterials were utilized for the photocatalytic destruction of methylene blue (MB). The photocatalytic activity of PVA-modified Mg-doped CuO nanocomposite is magnificent to CuO and Mg-doped CuO nanomaterials. This is because of the remarkable electron-hole dissociation and overwhelming increased photocatalytic activity achieved through surface modification. Additionally, the consequence of several reaction factors like pH, catalyst dosage, and MB concentration was deliberated. This research could lead to the development of polymer-based metal oxide-doped catalysts for the decomposition of organic contaminants in wastewater.},

abstract = {The nanomaterial industry has focused on green synthetic methods to avoid unpleasant compounds produced during manufacturing, offering eco-friendly, sustainable, and nature-derived alternative methods. In this study, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been synthesized from an aqueous extract of the leaves of Rhododendron arboreum, where the pH of the reaction mixture is found to be crucial. The reaction progress monitored using the UV-Vis spectrophotometer displayed a strong absorption band at 425 nm at pH 9, suggesting an optimum pH for the synthesis. The Ag NPs thus synthesized were characterized using instrumental techniques. The attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy showed the presence of phytoconstituents in the aqueous extract, which are believed to be responsible for reducing Ag+ ions to Ag NPs and capping agents on its surface for stability. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed a highly crystalline nature, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) demonstrated the presence of metallic silver. The scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively) revealed crystalline morphology and monodisperse Ag NPs of sizes ranging from 23 to 41 nm. Furthermore, the metal-sensing activity of biosynthesized Ag NPs was evaluated using various metal ions; they were utilized for highly selective and sensitive colorimetric detection of Hg2+ in an aqueous medium among various metal ion solutions tested with the detection limit of 0.5 mM using the UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Similarly, they were also shown to be effective for the nanocatalytic activity for degradation of methylene blue dye up to 81%. These studies demonstrated Ag NPs as potential candidates for selective detection of mercury in water resources, a tool for sensing the heavy metals and degradation of synthetic dye from industrial effluents in wastewater treatment. Having the high surface-to-volume ratio and size-dependent functionality of Ag NPs, further optimization studies at micromolar and nanomolar detection limits will avail its better industrial utilization. Moreover, biologically mediated Ag NPs can also exhibit good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.},

In this investigation, the austenitic grade of low nickel-tempered steel material was spun and met with the crack. The deformation of spinning is done on the various angles with change in percentage of thickness from 14 to 80%. The characterization of the fracture has been concentrated by the field emission scanning electron microscope to notice the morphological states of the material. The 12.5 mm WD of sample provides clear rupture in the grain boundaries of microstructure. The essential investigation was inspected by energy-dispersive spectroscopy. A solid connection was seen with both examinations approving the presence of voids in the material that causes the remaining anxieties which prompts the break on the SSLNA material.},

The composite materials were created by employing the most advantageous hand layup approach. To attain the aforementioned goals, the following limitations were implemented: at various levels, (i) coconut shell powder, (ii) walnut powder, and (iii) cryogenic treatment hours are all accessible. At 77 K, the laminated composite was put in a cryogenic chamber. Tensile, flexural, and interlaminar shear strengths were all tested mechanically. In comparison to 100 μm coconut shell powder-based particle composites, 80 μm walnut shell composites gave the maximum mechanical strength, while 10 wt% coconut shell powder and walnut and 80 wt% polyester also had a beneficial impact.

abstract = {Agave tequilana Weber var. azul fibers (ATF) are widely used as a reinforcement material despite their polarity makes them incompatible with hydrophobic matrices. Consequently, ATF are commonly modified employing different chemical processes (e.g., mercerization and coupling agents) to change their surface characteristics to improve the interface between the fibers and the polymeric matrix. Nevertheless, these treatments could damage the fibers during the process, negatively affecting their natural properties. The use of nanotechnology to repair this natural material could help to restore its intrinsic properties and give it new ones as antibacterial activity. In this work, chemically treated ATF were used as templates for the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a natural extract obtained from Agave tequilana Weber var. azul leaves (ATL) as reducing agent. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images as well as dynamic light scattering results indicate that stable nanometric particles were successfully synthesized on all fibers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results confirm the composition of the nanoparticles. Tensile tests indicate that AgNPs improved the mechanical properties of fibers previously mercerized and treated with maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene as coupling agent. Additionally, an antibacterial effect against S. enterica was conferred to ATF due to the presence of AgNPs.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects of a minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and a Cupric oxide- (CuO-) based nanofluid on Inconel 718 machinability. Additionally, by using an MQL CuO-based nanofluid during the turning process, Inconel 718’s tribological characteristics are optimised. The experimentation was done using the minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) method. With the aid of magnetic stirring and an ultrasonic bath process, CuO nanoparticles were dispersed in distilled water, sunflower oil, and soyabean oil to create nanofluid. Soyabean oil contains uniformly distributed CuO nanoparticles. All the experimental trials are designed based on the L18 Taguchi-based orthogonal arrays and performed on CNC turning under MQL and nanofluid environment. There are four input parameters that were selected at mixed level, namely, cutting speed, feed rate, weight % of CuO in the nanofluid, and flow rate to analyze surface roughness and tool wear. In addition to that, the response surface method was used to identify the optimum condition for better surface roughness and tool wear. Surface roughness and tool wear were measured using the surface roughness tester and toolmaker’s microscope, respectively. Experimental results observed that cutting speed and weight % highly affect surface roughness whereas cutting speed and flow rate affect tool wear. The predicted optimal values for lower surface roughness are 160 ml/hr flow rate, 92.99 m/min cutting speed, 3 weight % of CuO, and 0.1 mm/min feed rate and for low tool wear 80 ml/hr flow rate, 92.99 m/min cutting speed, 3 weight % of CuO, and 0.1 mm/min feed rate.},

abstract = {A study on the microscopic morphology of real-world polymer blends and its mechanism of change showed that the microscopic morphology of equiproportional mixtures gradually changed from a dense body structure to a network structure with the addition of the total polymer concentration up to 20%; the microscopic morphology of mixtures with different proportions was characterized by the most uniform network structure of equiproportional mixtures when the total polymer concentration was 20%. The polymer acts as a defoamer in the mixed system. In this paper, the relationship between the microscopic morphology of each mixture and the physicochemical behavior of the two polymer chains in the mixed system was investigated on the basis of the Aifantis strain gradient theory. Molecular polymer microscopic interface and multiscale failure analysis are proposed. It is shown that for the dihedral angle distribution of four consecutive coarse-grained particles, the peaks obtained from all atomic-scale simulation data are reproduced in the coarse-grained model simulations. The deviation is within 2.5% in most places, except for the local area where the deviation exceeds 5%. Therefore, we have achieved good results for large-scale failures.},

In this study, AgNPs were in vitro green synthesized using A. graecorum, and its antifungal and antitumoractivities were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image result indicated spherical shape of AgNPs with a size range of 22-36 nm indicated by using Image J program. The functional groups indicated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) represented the groups involved in the reduction of silver ion into nanoparticles. Alhagi graecorum AgNPs inhibited MCF-7 breast cancer cell line growth in increased concentration depend manner, significant differences shown at 50, 100, and 150 μg/ml concentrations compared to the control. Strong antifungal activity against Candida species (C. albicans., C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicales, and C. krusei) was observed and the inhibition zone range from 14-22 mm at a concentration of 0.01 mmol/ml and from 17-27 mm at a concentration of 0.02 mmol/ml. Based on our findings, it is concluded that synthesized silver nanoparticles from A. graecorum can be used as a potential antitumor and antifungal agent for various therapeutical applications.},

abstract = {Accurate gland segmentation in histology tissue images is a critical but challenging task. Although deep models have demonstrated superior performance in medical image segmentation, they commonly require a large amount of annotated data, which are hard to obtain due to the extensive labor costs and expertise required. In this paper, we propose an intra- and inter-pair consistency-based semi-supervised (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CS) model that can be trained on both labeled and unlabeled histology images for gland segmentation. Considering that each image contains glands and hence different images could potentially share consistent semantics in the feature space, we introduce a novel intra- and inter-pair consistency module to explore such consistency for learning with unlabeled data. It first characterizes the pixel-level relation between a pair of images in the feature space to create an attention map that highlights the regions with the same semantics but on different images. Then, it imposes a consistency constraint on the attention maps obtained from multiple image pairs, and thus filters low-confidence attention regions to generate refined attention maps that are then merged with original features to improve their representation ability. In addition, we also design an object-level loss to address the issues caused by touching glands. We evaluated our model against several recent gland segmentation methods and three typical semi-supervised methods on the GlaS and CRAG datasets. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed due consistency module and Obj-Dice loss, but also indicate that the proposed I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CS model achieves state-of-the-art gland segmentation performance on both benchmarks.},

abstract = {Patients with hypertension are seriously affected by Parkinson’s disease than patients with normal blood pressure. Thus, early detection of hypertension and Parkinson disease by monitoring subtle changes in specific biomarkers from body fluids can minimize the risk. This paper proposes a flexible, portable paper-based sensor for simultaneous electrochemical sensing of dopamine and uric acid, using differential pulse voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on electrodeposited Prussian blue on carbon dots@graphite paper. The characteristic peaks of dopamine and uric acid in the differential pulse voltammogram are well separated. Further surface characterization of Prussian blue/carbon dots@graphite paper was carried out by Raman Spectra and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The proposed sensor promoted the fast electrochemical detection of dopamine and uric acid with the linear response for concentrations from 0.2–920.0&nbsp;μM with a limit of detection 0.015&nbsp;μM, respectively in an aqueous sample. Excellent flexing stability is demonstrated by the proposed sensor, which can maintain its initial current after being bent more than 300 times.},
