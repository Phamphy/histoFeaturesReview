15610232,"Quantitative morphometry of lupus nephritis: the significance of collagen, tubular space, and inflammatory infiltrate","Hunter MG, Hurwitz S, Bellamy CO, Duffield JS.",Kidney Int. 2005 Jan;67(1):94-102. doi: 10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00059.x.,Hunter MG,Kidney Int,2005,2004/12/22,,,10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00059.x,"BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis encompasses a wide range of parenchymal injuries and severity. Better predictors of outcome are needed for patients newly diagnosed with lupus nephritis, so that an appropriate management strategy may be selected. METHODS: A single-center cohort of first renal biopsies for lupus nephritis was chosen. Histologic sections of whole biopsy cores were stained with picro-Sirius red, and light microscopic images (x100) were digitally captured. Using a simple, freely available software package, the cortex of each biopsy was evaluated for four different parameters: area occupied by nuclei, intratubular space, fibrillary collagen, and collagenous matrix. Clinical and laboratory data were collected retrospectively from the time of biopsy and throughout follow-up. RESULTS: A high nuclear index at initial biopsy correlated with clinical parameters of disease activity, at the time of biopsy. High collagen matrix index predicted both relapse and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The fibrillary collagen index predicted progressive disease as assessed by doubling of serum creatinine, and relapse. Increased tubular space also predicted progressive disease as determined by doubling of creatinine and renal death. CONCLUSION: A simple automated system for objectively scoring biopsies of lupus nephritis predicts renal survival and may provide a useful adjunct to guide patient management."
15653234,On the potential of the Lagrangian speckle model estimator to characterize atherosclerotic plaques in endovascular elastography: in vitro experiments using an excised human carotid artery,"Maurice RL, Brusseau E, Finet G, Cloutier G.",Ultrasound Med Biol. 2005 Jan;31(1):85-91. doi: 10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2004.07.009.,Maurice RL,Ultrasound Med Biol,2005,2005/01/18,,,10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2004.07.009,"Endovascular ultrasound (US) elastography (EVE) was introduced to supplement endovascular US echograms in the assessment of vessel lesions and for endovascular therapy planning. Indeed, changes in the vascular tissue stiffness are characteristic of vessel wall pathologies and EVE appears as a very appropriate imaging technique to outline the elastic properties of vessel walls. Recently, a model-based approach was proposed to assess tissue motion in EVE. It specifically consists of a nonlinear minimization algorithm that was adapted to speckle motion estimation. Regarding the theoretical framework, such an approach considers the speckle as a material property; this assumption then led to the derivation of the optical flow equations, which were suitably combined with the Lagrangian speckle model estimator to provide the full 2-D polar strain tensor. In this study, the proposed algorithm was validated in vitro using a fresh excised human carotid artery. The experimental setup consisted of a cardiovascular imaging system (CVIS) US scanner, working with a 30-MHz mechanical rotating single-element transducer, a digital oscilloscope and a pressuring system. A sequence of radiofrequency (RF) images was collected while incrementally adjusting the intraluminal static pressure steps. The results showed the potential of this 2-D algorithm to characterize and to distinguish an atherosclerotic plaque from the normal vascular tissue. Namely, the geometry as well as some mechanical characteristics of the detected plaque were in good agreement with histology. The results also suggested that there might exist a range of intraluminal pressures for which plaque detectability is optimal."

METHODS: We analyzed prostatectomy slides in a blinded manner from 17 men treated with dutasteride, an inhibitor of types 1 and 2 isoenzymes of 5-alpha-reductase, and 18 men treated with placebo for 5 to 11 weeks before radical prostatectomy. The histopathologic features of benign epithelium, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and cancer were recorded, and the treatment effect was scored. Digital imaging analysis was used to measure the stroma/epithelium ratio and epithelial height, as well as the nuclear area in cancer. RESULTS: In benign epithelium, treatment caused distinctive cytoarchitectural changes of atrophy and a decrease in the epithelial height (P = 0.053). The peripheral zone showed the most marked response to treatment. In cancer tissue, the tumor volume was significantly lower in the dutasteride-treated men than in the placebo-treated men (mean 15% versus 24%, respectively, P = 0.025), the percentage of atrophic epithelium was increased (P = 0.041), and the stroma/gland ratio was doubled (P = 0.046). The treatment alteration effect score was doubled (P = 0.055) and did not correlate with any Gleason score changes. CONCLUSIONS: After short-term dutasteride treatment, benign epithelium showed involution and epithelial shrinkage, and prostate cancer tissue demonstrated a decrease in epithelium relative to stroma. These findings indicate that dutasteride induces significant phenotypic alterations in both the benign and the neoplastic prostate, supportive of a chemopreventive or chemoactive role."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 50 patients affected by locally advanced breast carcinoma (T3a e b-T4), using CDU before and after injection of Levovist, prior to and after neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment. RESULTS: The use of Levovist for ultrasound examinations prior to treatment revealed a higher number of vascular signals in 94% of the lesions compared to the basic color-Doppler examination; in only 3 cases (6%) were no modifications observed after injection of the contrast medium. This finding was also evident after neoadjuvant treatment, as a greater number of vessels in 28 lesions were observed, in addition to residual vascularization in 9 patients in whom the basic color-Doppler examination demonstrated substantial avascularity. Histopathology revealed that this method was more sensitive in disclosing the presence of active neoplastic tissue. CONCLUSION: Color-Doppler ultrasound is the first step in assessing the efficacy of neochemotherapeutic treatment in patients affected by locally advanced breast carcinoma. Levovist increases sensitivity and improves the diagnostic precision, thus allowing for a better image of the vessels, which is an important index of the biological activity of the neoplasm, compared to the basic color-Doppler examination."
16055979,Reconstruction of human optic nerve heads for finite element modeling,"Sigal IA, Flanagan JG, Tertinegg I, Ethier CR.",Technol Health Care. 2005;13(4):313-29.,Sigal IA,Technol Health Care,2005,2005/08/02,,,,"PURPOSE: Glaucoma is a common ocular disease whose pathogenesis is hypothesized to involve biomechanical damage to optic nerve tissues. Here we describe a method for the construction of patient-specific models that can be used to evaluate the biomechanical environment within the optic nerve head. We validate the method using a virtual eye, and demonstrate its use in computing optic nerve head biomechanics. METHODS: Human eyes were imaged and the optic nerve head region was processed to allow serial plastic histologic sections to be cut. These sections were photographed, unwarped and aligned so as to reconstruct three-dimensional patient-specific models incorporating sclera, pre- and post-laminar nerve, lamina cribrosa, and pia mater. Deformations, stresses and strains were computed in the resulting model using finite element techniques. RESULTS: The approach successfully reconstructed patient-specific optic nerve head models. Reconstruction of a virtual eye showed excellent agreement between the true and reconstructed geometries, and between the deformations and strains computed on the true and reconstructed geometries. A sample reconstruction showed reasonable agreement between computed and measured retinal surface deformations. CONCLUSION: The technique presented here is viable and can be used to accurately compute human optic nerve head biomechanics."
16092667,Immunohistochemical analysis of the interstitial mast cells in rebiopsied patients with idiopathic mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis,"Danilewicz M, Wagrowska-Danilewicz M.",Pol J Pathol. 2005;56(2):63-8.,Danilewicz M,Pol J Pathol,2005,2005/08/12,,,,"Recent evidence suggests a role for mast cells in the pathogenesis of renal scarring in various glomerulopathies, therefore the present study was undertaken to evaluate whether mast cells have a role in tubulointerstitial fibrosis in rebiopsied patients with idiopathic mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPG) and to examine a possible relationship between mast cells and interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression as well as interstitial infiltrates. Seventeen patients with idiopathic mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, in whom renal biopsies were repeated and for whom light and electron microscopy as well as immunofluorescence microscopy and full clinical data were available were examined quantitatively. Morphometric investigations were performed by means of a computer image analysis system. The study revealed that at the rebiopsy proteinuria was significantly lower as compared with the first biopsy. On the other hand, the mean values of the interstitial tryptase positive cells, expression of alpha-SMA, interstitial volume and CD68+ cells were at rebiopsy significantly increased. The mean values of CD45RB+, CD43+ and CD20+ cells did not differ significantly in these groups. In both initial biopsy and rebiopsy groups there were significant positive correlations between interstitial tryptase positive cells and interstitial expression of alpha-SMA, interstitial volume, and CD68+ cells. The present quantitative study may suggest that despite of the clinical improvement at rebiopsy, MPG is a progressive glomerular disease, and point to a role of mast cells in this process."
16308473,Multi-resolution wavelet-transformed image analysis of histological sections of breast carcinomas,"Hwang HG, Choi HJ, Lee BI, Yoon HK, Nam SH, Choi HK.",Cell Oncol. 2005;27(4):237-44. doi: 10.1155/2005/526083.,Hwang HG,Cell Oncol,2005,2005/11/26,PMC4615965,,10.1155/2005/526083,"Multi-resolution images of histological sections of breast cancer tissue were analyzed using texture features of Haar- and Daubechies transform wavelets. Tissue samples analyzed were from ductal regions of the breast and included benign ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (CA). To assess the correlation between computerized image analysis and visual analysis by a pathologist, we created a two-step classification system based on feature extraction and classification. In the feature extraction step, we extracted texture features from wavelet-transformed images at 10x magnification. In the classification step, we applied two types of classifiers to the extracted features, namely a statistics-based multivariate (discriminant) analysis and a neural network. Using features from second-level Haar transform wavelet images in combination with discriminant analysis, we obtained classification accuracies of 96.67 and 87.78% for the training and testing set (90 images each), respectively. We conclude that the best classifier of carcinomas in histological sections of breast tissue are the texture features from the second-level Haar transform wavelet images used in a discriminant function."
16325509,A computer-assisted morphometric quantitative analysis of iron overload in liver biopsies. A comparison with histological and biochemical methods,"Ortega L, Ladero JM, Carreras MP, Alvarez T, Taxonera C, Oliván MP, Sanz-Esponera J, Díaz-Rubio M.",Pathol Res Pract. 2005;201(10):673-7. doi: 10.1016/j.prp.2005.07.002. Epub 2005 Sep 26.,Ortega L,Pathol Res Pract,2005,2005/12/06,,,10.1016/j.prp.2005.07.002,"The aim of this study was to evaluate a new method of image analysis used to quantify the iron load in routinely processed liver biopsies. Sixty-four liver biopsies from the same number of patients were studied. Both biochemical determination of iron concentration and histopathological semiquantification and quantification were performed. The latter was performed on Perls-stained liver sections by a semiautomatic system of image analysis that yields the percentage of stained liver tissue. In 43 samples with an hepatic iron content higher than 2000microg/mg of dry tissue, this morphometric index was compared to the liver iron load measured biochemically, showing a significant correlation (Spearman's test) between both variables (rho = 0.686, p<0.001). Moreover, there is a better correlation when the semiquantitative Deugnier's histological index is compared with the biochemical method (rho = 0.425, p<0.004). Thus, we conclude that image analysis may be a valid method to assess hepatic iron storage in patients with liver diseases and that it may be more accurate than semiquantitative grading systems, such as the one described by Deugnier, since the morphometric method shows a closer correlation with the hepatic iron concentration determined biochemically."
16435192,"A comparative study of cytoplasmic granules imaged by the real-time microscope, Nile Red and Filipin in fibroblasts from patients with lipid storage diseases","Pham NA, Gal MR, Bagshaw RD, Mohr AJ, Chue B, Richardson T, Callahan JW.",J Inherit Metab Dis. 2005;28(6):991-1004. doi: 10.1007/s10545-005-0117-7.,Pham NA,J Inherit Metab Dis,2005,2006/01/26,,,10.1007/s10545-005-0117-7,"Cytoplasmic granules in fibroblasts, visualized without stains, or labelled with Nile red, Filipin, or anti-LAMP-1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1), were imaged using the real-time microscope (RTM). New advances in light microscope technology were applied to detect cytoplasmic granules (RTM-visible granules) and characterize them by imaging contrast, size, shape, cellular distribution, composition, motion dynamics and quantity. Appearing as solid spheroids or ring structures, the majority of the RTM-visible granules contained Nile-red labelled neutral lipids. A smaller subpopulation, appearing dimmer, with less imaging contrast, contained Filipin-labelled free cholesterol. Most lipid storage granules have a diameter ranging from 0.3 mum to 0.6 mum, with a small population measuring up to 1 mum. They typically clustered in the perinuclear region and displayed relatively small oscillatory motion. Immunofluorescence based on LAMP-1 labelling highlighted granular structures that were distinct and separate from RTM-visible granules and other structures in the light modality of the microscope. RTM-visible granules were associated with disease phenotypes that have increased cellular neutral lipid stores corresponding to the Nile red-labelled droplets (e.g. triacylglycerides, cholesterol esters). As predicted, the fibroblast strains with a defect resulting in Wolman disease, when compared to control samples, consistently had RTM-visible granules, higher in imaging contrast and with larger diameters, that were labelled with Nile red, and also an increased frequency of Filipin-cholesterol complexes. By comparison, in fibroblasts where the lipid storage is less evident (Gaucher and Farber diseases) or from GM(1) gangliosidosis, where the primary storage substances are oligosaccharides, fewer and smaller RTM-visible granules were observed. In some cases, changes in contrast and morphology in the unstained cytoplasmic compartments were more evident than in the labelled structures. In summary, applying the RTM imaging system to fibroblasts enables differences between the various disease types to be seen and, in specific examples, a unique phenotype can be readily discerned."
16685913,Efficient learning by combining confidence-rated classifiers to incorporate unlabeled medical data,"He W, Huang X, Metaxas D, Ying X.",Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv. 2005;8(Pt 1):745-52. doi: 10.1007/11566465_92.,He W,Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv,2005,2006/05/12,,,10.1007/11566465_92,"In this paper, we propose a new dynamic learning framework that requires a small amount of labeled data in the beginning, then incrementally discovers informative unlabeled data to be hand-labeled and incorporates them into the training set to improve learning performance. This approach has great potential to reduce the training expense in many medical image analysis applications. The main contributions lie in a new strategy to combine confidence-rated classifiers learned on different feature sets and a robust way to evaluate the ""informativeness"" of each unlabeled example. Our framework is applied to the problem of classifying microscopic cell images. The experimental results show that 1) our strategy is more effective than simply multiplying the predicted probabilities, 2) the error rate of high-confidence predictions is much lower than the average error rate, and 3) hand-labeling informative examples with low-confidence predictions improves performance efficiently and the performance difference from hand-labeling all unlabeled data is very small."

Such techniques are also time consuming, and inefficient of extracting essential information on the vascular network. Image analysis has yet to contribute significantly in this direction, and most studies to date focus on blood vessel segmentation through empirical, user-selected thresholds. The present paper proposes an alternative segmentation approach, based on a probabilistic relaxation algorithm, applied in microscopic images of stained tissues. After image partitioning various information is obtained, such as vascular domains and geometrical characteristics of vessels."
15664286,Visualisation of calcifications and thin collagen strands in human breast tumour specimens by the diffraction-enhanced imaging technique: a comparison with conventional mammography and histology,"Keyriläinen J, Fernández M, Fiedler S, Bravin A, Karjalainen-Lindsberg ML, Virkkunen P, Elo EM, Tenhunen M, Suortti P, Thomlinson W.",Eur J Radiol. 2005 Feb;53(2):226-37. doi: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2004.03.015.,Keyriläinen J,Eur J Radiol,2005,2005/01/25,,,10.1016/j.ejrad.2004.03.015,"Six excised human breast tissue specimens carrying benign and malignant tumours were examined with the diffraction-enhanced imaging technique. Diffraction-enhanced images were compared with diagnostic screen-film mammograms and the correlation with histological information of the specimens was established. The enhanced visibility of calcifications, some of which were smaller than 0.15 mm in diameter, is reported in detail. Fine details of the structures such as strands of collagen and contours between glandular and adipose tissue, which are barely visible at the contrast detection limit in the conventional absorption-based mammograms, are clearly visible in the diffraction-enhanced images. Microscopic study of the stained histopathological sections unequivocally confirms the correlation of the radiographic findings with the morphologic changes in specimens. An increased soft tissue contrast and a combination of information obtained with disparate diffraction-enhanced images provide better visibility of mammographically indistinguishable features. This kind of additional structural information of the breast tissue is required to improve assessment accuracy and earlier detection of the breast lesions. These advances in image quality make the method a very promising candidate for mammography."

METHODS: Modeling. An in-house cellular-automata solidification and finite-difference diffusion program was coupled with a commercial casting program and applied to (a) simple geometric wedge models and (b) a 3D-laser scan of a molar crown casting. Experimental. Wedges and molar crowns were hand-waxed and investment cast in commercial purity grade 1 (CP-1) titanium by a commercial dental laboratory. The castings were sectioned and analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis, and microhardness testing. RESULTS: In the wedge sample, contamination with impurities (Al, Si), including intermetallic precipitates, was found to extend to a depth ranging from 30 to 120 microm depending on the section thickness and hence the local cooling rate. Microstructural and mechanical (hardness) effects were found to a depth ranging from 80 to 250 microm. The coupled micro/macro model predictions showed reasonable agreement for the pattern of contamination. SIGNIFICANCE: Dental and medical applications demand close dimensional tolerance and freedom from surface impurities and structural flaws in castings having unique shapes. The ability to predict the structural, mechanical, and chemical changes resulting from the casting process will help to design the casting and post-casting processes to minimize these problems."

The measure attempts to quantify the degree of irregularity of the structural indentations and protrusions along a lesion border. A carefully designed study has shown that the parameters derived from the Irregularity Index were highly correlated with expert dermatologists' notion of border shape. This paper investigates the predictive power of these parameters on a set of data with known histological diagnosis. METHODS: A set of 188 pigmented skin lesions (30 malignant melanomas and 158 benign lesions) was selected for the study. Their images were segmented and their border shapes were analysed by the Irregularity Index, producing four border irregularity parameters. The predictive power of these four parameters was estimated by a series of statistical tests. RESULTS: The mean values of the four border irregularity parameters were significantly different between the melanoma group and the benign lesion group. When using the four parameters to predict its disease status, the leave-one-out classification rate was 82.4%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.77. A malignant melanoma was 8.9 times more likely to have an irregular border than a benign lesion. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that border irregularity is an important clinical feature for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. It also indicates that the computer-derived measures based on the Irregularity Index capture to certain extent the kind of irregularity which is exhibited by melanomas."

In this study the authors investigated peritumoral edema by performing lambda chart analysis (LCA), a noninvasive technique that can be used to make visible and analyze apparent water diffusivity in tissues in vivo, and assessed the utility of LCA in differentiating high-grade gliomas from nonglial tumors. METHODS: The water diffusivity characteristics of peritumoral edema associated with four tumor groups-12 high-grade gliomas, five low-grade gliomas, 11 metastatic tumors, and 15 meningiomas-were assessed in 43 patients by performing magnetic resonance imaging with the aid of a 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. In all tumor groups, peritumoral edema exhibited greater trace values and reduced anisotropy compared with normal white matter. Edema associated with high-grade gliomas had significantly higher trace values than edema associated with the other three tumor groups, although the anisotropic angles of those groups were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Lambda chart analysis identified two distinct types of peritumoral edema: edema associated with high-grade gliomas and edema associated with low-grade gliomas or nonglial tumors. The apparent water diffusivity was significantly greater in high-grade gliomas, whereas the anisotropy in these lesions was comparable to that of edema in other tumors. These findings indicated that water movement in areas of edema, predominantly in the extracellular spaces, was less restricted in high-grade gliomas, a phenomenon that likely reflected the destruction of the extracellular matrix ultrastructure by malignant cell infiltration and consequently greater water diffusion. Although preliminary, this study indicates that LCA could be used as a clinical tool for differentiating high-grade gliomas and for evaluating the extent of cellular infiltration."

Epub 2005 Jan 5.,Caparelli EC,Neuroimage,2005,2005/01/27,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.11.011,"Several modern MRI techniques, such as functional MRI (fMRI), rely on the detection of microscopic changes in magnetic susceptibility. However, differences in magnetic susceptibility between brain tissue, bone, and air also produce local magnetic field gradients that may interfere with the contrast of interest, particularly at high field strengths. Since the magnetic field distribution depends on the orientation of the human head in the MRI scanner, head rotations can change the effective transverse relaxation rate (R(2)*) and confound fMRI studies. The size of the R(2)* changes produced by small head rotations was estimated from a brain-shaped gel-phantom at 4 T, by measuring the signal decay at 96 different echo times. Similar measurements were carried out in a human study. Rotations larger than 2 degrees changed R(2)* more than 1.5 Hz in the phantom, and indicate that even small rotations may compromise fMRI results."

This research compared high field, high-resolution MRI of formalin-fixed normal human hippocampus specimens to histologic sectioning of the same hippocampus samples. Four specimens were evaluated using an 8 Tesla (T), 80 cm bore whole-body MRI scanner equipped with a 12.7 cm single strut transverse electromagnetic resonator (TEM) coil. Hahn spin echo images were acquired with a repetition time (TR) of 800 msec, echo times (TE) of 20, 50, 90, and 134 msec, and an acquisition time (TA) of 3.25 min. The image quality was superb with demonstration of most of the features of the hippocampus. High field, high-resolution MRI can be used to depict multiple layers of the formalin-fixed human hippocampus in vitro using an 8 T whole-body scanner, a TEM coil, and short acquisition times compatible with human imaging in vivo."

The Zenon technique conjugates primary antibodies rapidly and quantitatively after which they are used in the same manner as covalently labeled primary antibodies. Digital microscopic images of epidermal expression of keratin 10 and keratin 6 (differentiation), Ki-67 antigen (proliferation), and keratin 15 and beta-1 integrin (basal layer) were analyzed in a standardized way. Co-expression of different proteins was demonstrated. METHODS: Sections of normal skin and psoriatic lesions were compared immunohistochemically. Antibodies against keratin 6, 10, and 15 were labeled with the Zenon technique. Antibodies against the Ki-67 antigen and beta-1 integrin were covalently fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled. Using standardized image analysis, intensity and positive surface area of the different antibodies in the epidermis were measured. RESULTS: The number of Ki-67-antigen positive cells was significantly increased in lesional psoriatic skin. Intensity and positive surface area of keratin 10 and beta-1 integrin were significantly decreased in comparison to normal epidermis. Differential expression of keratin 6 and keratin 15 was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Using Zenon technology and image analysis, a description of morphology, co-expression, and quantification of representative markers for epidermal cell populations is possible."

Therefore, mucosae of 49 resected rectae from individuals with UC were histologically and quantitatively analyzed, with regard to thickness and morphological parameters of crypts, in relation to the disease duration, clinical disease activity and neoplastic development. An immunohistochemical examination of Ki-67, p53, p21(WAF1) and ssDNA labeling was also included. Significant correlations of number, height, angle, fusion and Paneth cell metaplasia of crypts, as well as thickness of the muscularis mucosae, were revealed with disease duration, as confirmed by three-dimensional reconstructed image analysis. p53 and p21(WAF1)-positive cells increased with disease duration and were significantly more frequent in cases with neoplasia, suggesting more DNA damage. However, this was not the case for ssDNA labeling, assessed as an indicator of apoptosis. In general, histological changes and p53, p21(WAF1) and Ki-67 labeling were correlated. In conclusion, histological parameters for mucosal remodeling correlate well with UC duration, indicating accumulation of structural alterations. Accumulated damage to DNA, reflected by increased p53 and p21(WAF1) labeling indices, might be involved in cancer development, as well as longstanding inflammation."

Based on our previous studies, a 1,200-1,300-nm femtosecond laser can provide superior penetration capability with minimized photodamage possibility. However, with the longer wavelength excitation, three-photon-fluorescence (3PF) would be necessary for efficient use of intrinsic and extrinsic visible fluorophores. The three-photon process can provide much better spatial resolution than two-photon-fluorescence due to the cubic power dependency. On the other hand, third-harmonic-generation (THG), another intrinsic three-photon process, is interface-sensitive and can be used as a general structural imaging modality to show the exact location of cellular membranes. The virtual-transition characteristic of THG prevents any excess energy from releasing in bio-tissues and, thus, THG acts as a truly noninvasive imaging tool. Here we demonstrated the first combined 3PF and THG microscopy, which can provide three-dimensional high-resolution images with both functional molecule specificity and sub-micrometer structural mapping capability. The simultaneously acquired 3PF and THG images based on a 1,230-nm Cr:forsterite femtosecond laser are shown with a Hoechst-labeled hepatic cell sample. Strong 3PF around 450 nm from DNA-bounded Hoechst-33258 can be observed inside each nucleus while THG reveals the location of plasma membranes and other membrane-based organelles such as mitochondria. Considering that the maximum-allowable laser power in common nonlinear laser microscopy is less than 10 mW at 800 nm, it is remarkable that even with a 100-mW 1,230-nm incident power, there is no observable photo damage on the cells, demonstrating the noninvasiveness of this novel microscopy technique."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients (41 men, 30 women; mean age, 63 years; range, 29-80 years) with suspected pancreatic tumor underwent MDCT. Scanning was performed on an MDCT scanner with 0.5-sec gantry rotation and acquisition of 4 slices per rotation. Unenhanced scanning was followed by one set of scanning in the caudocranial direction from the inferior hepatic margin to the diaphragm with a scanning delay of 60 sec after the IV injection of 150 mL of contrast material delivered at 3 mL/sec. Two reviewers independently scored images in a blinded fashion for the presence of tumor and assessment of resectability. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. RESULTS: A final histopathologic diagnosis derived from surgical findings was obtained in 42 patients; in the remaining 29 patients, percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy coupled with a 1-year clinical follow-up to determine development of local, regional or distant neoplasm served as gold standard proof of diagnosis. Final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 40 patients (27 ductal adenocarcinoma, nine mucinous cystoadenocarcinoma, two neuroendocrine tumors, one lymphoma, and one papillary cystoadenocarcinoma) and chronic pancreatitis in 31. The mean tumor size was 2.4 cm (range, 4-1 cm). Values for the area under the curve (A(z)) for the assessment of tumor detection were 0.97 for reviewer 1 and 0.96 for reviewer 2 (p = not significant). A(z) values for tumor resectability were 0.90 for reviewer 1 and 0.90 for reviewer 2 (p = not significant). No statistically significant differences were observed between superior mesenteric artery and vein opacification with the hepatic parenchyma enhanced at a time closer to the peak hepatic enhancement, optimizing the detection of hepatic lesions. CONCLUSION: Thin-section single-phase MDCT is an accurate technique for the diagnosis and assessment of resectability in patients with a suspected pancreatic neoplasm. This technique provides optimal tumor-to-pancreas contrast and maximal pancreatic parenchymal and peripancreatic vascular enhancement. It allows visualization of the entire liver and the whole upper abdomen during the portal phase for accurate identification of liver metastases and peritoneal seeding."

However, this may be partly a result of sample dilution or the detection limit of techniques. The aim of this study was to determine whether oral squamous carcinomas are heterogeneous for ploidy status using image-based ploidy analysis and to determine whether ploidy status correlates with histological parameters. Multiple samples from 42 oral squamous carcinomas were analysed for DNA ploidy using an image-based system and scored for histological parameters. 22 were uniformly aneuploid, 1 uniformly tetraploid and 3 uniformly diploid. 16 appeared heterogeneous but only 8 appeared to be genuinely heterogeneous when minor ploidy histogram peaks were taken into account. Ploidy was closely related to nuclear pleomorphism but not differentiation. Sample variation, detection limits and diagnostic criteria account for much of the ploidy heterogeneity observed. Confident diagnosis of diploid status in an oral squamous cell carcinoma requires a minimum of 5 samples."

However, the core problem of the clinical evaluation of mammographic tumors remains a highly demanding cognitive task. In order for these automated diagnostic systems to perform in levels of sensitivity and specificity similar to that of human experts, it is essential that a robust framework on problem-specific design parameters is formulated. This study is focused on identifying a robust set of clinical features that can be used as the base for designing the input of any computer-aided diagnosis system for automatic mammographic tumor evaluation. A thorough list of clinical features was constructed and the diagnostic value of each feature was verified against current clinical practices by an expert physician. These features were directly or indirectly related to the overall morphological properties of the mammographic tumor or the texture of the fine-scale tissue structures as they appear in the digitized image, while others contained external clinical data of outmost importance, like the patient's age. The entire feature set was used as an annotation list for describing the clinical properties of mammographic tumor cases in a quantitative way, such that subsequent objective analyses were possible. For the purposes of this study, a mammographic image database was created, with complete clinical evaluation descriptions and positive histological verification for each case. All tumors contained in the database were characterized according to the identified clinical features' set and the resulting dataset was used as input for discrimination and diagnostic value analysis for each one of these features. Specifically, several standard methodologies of statistical significance analysis were employed to create feature rankings according to their discriminating power. Moreover, three different classification models, namely linear classifiers, neural networks and support vector machines, were employed to investigate the true efficiency of each one of them, as well as the overall complexity of the diagnostic task of mammographic tumor characterization. Both the statistical and the classification results have proven the explicit correlation of all the selected features with the final diagnosis, qualifying them as an adequate input base for any type of similar automated diagnosis system. The underlying complexity of the diagnostic task has justified the high value of sophisticated pattern recognition architectures."

However, due to the unknown arterial stress distribution these elastograms cannot be directly interpreted as a morphology and material composition image. To overcome this limitation we have developed a method that reconstructs a Young's modulus image from an elastogram. This method is especially suited for thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFAs), i.e., plaques with a media region containing a lipid pool covered by a cap. Reconstruction is done by a minimization algorithm that matches the strain image output, calculated with a parametric finite element model (PFEM) representation of a TCFA, to an elastogram by iteratively updating the PFEM geometry and material parameters. These geometry parameters delineate the TCFA media, lipid pool and cap regions by circles. The material parameter for each region is a Young's modulus, EM, EL, and EC, respectively. The method was successfully tested on computer-simulated TCFAs (n = 2), one defined by circles, the other by tracing TCFA histology, and additionally on a physical phantom (n = 1) having a stiff wall (measured EM = 16.8 kPa) with an eccentric soft region (measured EL = 4.2 kPa). Finally, it was applied on human coronary plaques in vitro (n = 1) and in vivo (n = 1). The corresponding simulated and measured elastograms of these plaques showed radial strain values from 0% up to 2% at a pressure differential of 20, 20, 1, 20, and 1 mmHg respectively. The used/reconstructed Young's moduli [kPa] were for the circular plaque EL = 50/66, EM = 1500/1484, EC = 2000/2047, for the traced plaque EL = 25/1, EM = 1000/1148, EC = 1500/1491, for the phantom EL = 4.2/4 kPa, EM = 16.8/16, for the in vitro plaque EL = n.a./29, EM = n.a./647, EC = n.a./1784 kPa and for the in vivo plaque EL = n.a./2, EM = n.a./188, Ec = n.a./188 kPa."
15895583,ROC study of the effect of stereoscopic imaging on assessment of breast lesions,"Chan HP, Goodsitt MM, Helvie MA, Hadjiiski LM, Lydick JT, Roubidoux MA, Bailey JE, Nees A, Blane CE, Sahiner B.",Med Phys. 2005 Apr;32(4):1001-9. doi: 10.1118/1.1870172.,Chan HP,Med Phys,2005,2005/05/18,,,10.1118/1.1870172,"An observer performance study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of assessing breast lesion characteristics with stereomammography. Stereoscopic image pairs of 158 breast biopsy tissue specimens were acquired with a GE Senographe 2000D full field digital mammography system using a 1.8x magnification geometry. A phantom-shift method equivalent to a stereo shift angle of +/- 3 degrees relative to a central axis perpendicular to the detector was used. For each specimen, two pairs of stereo images were taken at approximately orthogonal orientations. The specimens contained either a mass, microcalcifications, both, or normal tissue. Based on pathological analysis, 39.9% of the specimens were found to contain malignancy. The digital specimen radiographs were displayed on a high resolution MegaScan CRT monitor driven by a DOME stereo display board using in-house developed software. Five MQSA radiologists participated as observers. Each observer read the 316 specimen stereo image pairs in a randomized order. For each case, the observer first read the monoscopic image and entered his/her confidence ratings on the presence of microcalcifications and/or masses, margin status, BI-RADS assessment, and the likelihood of malignancy. The corresponding stereoscopic images were then displayed on the same monitor and were viewed through stereoscopic LCD glasses. The observer was free to change the ratings in every category after stereoscopic reading. The ratings of the observers were analyzed by ROC methodology. For the 5 MQSA radiologists, the average Az value for estimation of the likelihood of malignancy of the lesions improved from 0.70 for monoscopic reading to 0.72 (p=0.04) after stereoscopic reading, and the average Az value for the presence of microcalcifications improved from 0.95 to 0.96 (p=0.02). The Az value for the presence of masses improved from 0.80 to 0.82 after stereoscopic reading, but the difference fell short of statistical significance (p=0.08). The visual assessment of margin clearance was found to have very low correlation with microscopic analysis with or without stereoscopic reading. This study demonstrates the potential of using stereomammography to improve the detection and characterization of mammographic lesions."

For imaging of cells or tissues, it is required to obtain an image from which the morphology of the whole cell can be extracted. This is usually achieved by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. These images have a pseudo-3D appearance, easily interpreted by the human brain. In the age of high throughput and high content screening, manual image processing is not an option. Conventional algorithms for image processing often use threshold-based criteria to identify objects of interest. These algorithms fail for DIC images as they have a range from dim to bright with an intermediate intensity equal to the background, so as to produce no clear object boundary. In this article we compare different reconstruction methods for up to 100 MB-large DIC images and implement a new iterative reconstruction method based on the Hilbert Transform that enables identification of cell boundaries with standard threshold algorithms."

A statistical feature matrix was applied to quantify the texture difference (ie, the dissimilarity) of the sonographic images for malignant and benign breast tumors. METHODS: Thirty-three patients were recruited for this study. Imaging was performed on a commercially available sonographic imaging system in clinical use. The parameters used for image acquisition were kept the same during clinical examination. RESULTS: On the basis of dissimilarity values, 3 phenomena were noted in the relatively large malignancies studied. First, stellate carcinoma showed the least dissimilarity on sonographic images; second, circumscribed carcinoma showed the most dissimilarity; and third, malignant tissue mixed with fibrous and cellular parts (dense lymphocyte infiltration and prominent intraductal tumors) had dissimilarity values in between. Image textures with smaller dissimilarity values (especially for those values <4.4 in our study) are likely to be stellate carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: From the experimental results, it is shown that the cellular and fibrous content with spatial distribution of breast masses determine the dissimilarity values on sonographic images. The dissimilarity may be used to quantitatively represent the image texture and is well correlated with the histopathologic description."

The cortical surface was illuminated with a Xenon light through an operating microscope, and the reflected light, which passed through a 605 nm bandpass filter, was detected by a CCD camera-based optical imaging system. Individual electrical stimulation of five digits induced changes in the reflected light intensities. Visualizing the intrinsic optical responses, we constructed maps of finger representation in Brodmann's area 1. In the maps, response areas of Digits I to V were sequentially aligned along the central sulcus in the crown of the postcentral gyrus from the latero-inferior region (Digit I) to the medio-superior region (Digit V). The neighboring response areas partially overlapped each other, as previously described in the monkey somatosensory cortex. Similar results were obtained in the face region with stimulation of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve. These results suggest that the overlap of the response areas is a common feature in the somatosensory cortex not only in monkeys, but also in humans."

We introduce a new, MATLAB based toolbox for the SPM2 software package which enables the integration of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps and results of functional imaging studies. The toolbox includes the functionality for the construction of summary maps combining probability of several cortical areas by finding the most probable assignment of each voxel to one of these areas. Its main feature is to provide several measures defining the degree of correspondence between architectonic areas and functional foci. The software, together with the presently available probability maps, is available as open source software to the neuroimaging community. This new toolbox provides an easy-to-use tool for the integrated analysis of functional and anatomical data in a common reference space."

A previous study using diffusive labelling of fresh, dissected tissue samples with fluorescently-tagged endothelial markers demonstrated the possibility of examining the three-dimensional architecture of the microvasculature using confocal microscopy. The present study extends the use of this quick and simple method of diffusive labelling to examine the possibility of repeatedly measuring changes in the morphology of intact microvessel in response to pharmacological stimuli. Initially, three-dimensional surface-rendered images of the same microvessel derived from the placenta and subcutaneous biopsies demonstrated morphological and topological changes in response to temperature and increasing potassium changes of physiological salt solutions, respectively. Furthermore, a dose-response study was performed with subcutaneous microvessels using the potent vasodilator, adrenomedullin. Analysis of a series of z-stack, superimposed to form a single maximum brightness image, demonstrated an inverse dose-response relationship, with responses to increasing adrenomedullin concentrations (10(-12) to 10(-8) M). In vessels that had constricted in response to noradrenaline (diameters: 22.4 to 58.0 microm), physiological concentrations of 10(-12) M increased vessel diameter by 108% above baseline conditions. Control treatment using physiological salt solution did not demonstrate any changes. The technique described suggest that diffusive labelling with vascular endothelial markers such as ulex europeaus agglutinin I in live tissue samples may be used in conjunction with confocal microscopy to demonstrate heterogeneous morphological and topological changes in intact segments of the microvasculature."

The DS, calculated from 3 morphometric variables measured in routine hematoxylin-eosin-stained endometrial biopsy slides, is the most sensitive and specific method of endometrial cancer risk prediction currently available. Clinical outcomes of 103 women with endometrial hyperplasia on biopsy were tallied according to the DS. Seven (7/103; 7%) patients with carcinoma during follow-up were all distributed within the high-risk prognostic group (ie, DS <1 = endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia [EIN]) (7/21; 33% progression). None of the 82 cases with a DS higher than 1 progressed. All cases that progressed were PTEN null, indicating that this genotype is capable of further stratifying cancer progression risk in hyperplasias irrespective of histological categorization. However, only 16% of the PTEN-null cases progressed. When PTEN expression pattern was combined with EIN, the prognostic power was greatly increased (specificity from 63% for PTEN and 85% for EIN to 93% when combined; positive predictive value from 16% and 33% to 50%). We conclude that loss of PTEN expression is the first biomarker in EIN that increases the accuracy of the prognostic DS to predict cancer progression risk. Unless endometrial hyperplasias are stratified by histological morphometric D-Score, PTEN has a low positive predictive value."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 26 patients with adrenocortical adenoma and 24 patients with carcinoma were treated with adrenalectomy. Clinical features and immunohistochemical reactions were compared in adult vs pediatric tumors. RESULTS: There was a bimodal age distribution of carcinomas and adenomas, with a first peak occurring before age 5 years. The proportion of carcinomas in children (18 of 29) was higher than in adults (6 of 21). Carcinoma and adenoma occurring in children presented more commonly as the virilizing syndrome, while in adults Cushing's syndrome was more common. All adenomas in adults were p53 negative, while in children 4 of 11 adenomas (36%) were p53 positive. Histological Weiss criteria were the most reliable pathological features to distinguish adenoma from carcinoma. Other pathological features, including tumor weight, rate of mitotic figures and immunoexpression of p53 protein, MIB-1 antigen and PCNA, exhibited a striking difference in adenomas and carcinomas but none demonstrated sensitivity or specificity of 100%. Of all the computerized tomographic characteristics analyzed, including tumor size, shape, necrosis/hemorrhage, attenuation and contrast enhancement, only tumor size (greater than 5 cm) showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% in the differential diagnosis. Children and adults with carcinoma had similar curves of survival (p = 0.76). Carcinoma stage and PCNA immunoexpression displayed an association with outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Endocrine syndromes differed in adults and children but other clinical features were similar in both groups. The role of p53 protein, MIB-1 antigen and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in discrimination of adenomas from carcinomas is unclear."

METHODS: Five samples of each type of gland were obtained from autopsies of chronic alcoholics and equal number of samples from individuals whose death cause was accidental (controls). Serous acini in von Ebner and submaxillar glands and mucous acini in labial and Blandin-Nuhn glands were analysed. In the ductal system, intra and interlobular striated ducts were studied. A digital-image analyser was used to measure different parameters in the acini and ducts. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that lingual and submaxillar salivary glands presented a significant acinar hypertrophy and hyperplasy. These changes were not observed in labial salivary glands. All studied glands showed significant structural modifications in the striated ducts. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the significant variations together with the histological qualitative pattern could be useful as confident indicators for the differential histopathological diagnosis with other sialosis from different aetiology."

After chemotherapy, tumor sites were excised by lumpectomy or mastectomy. RESULTS: Three (11.3%) of 34 patients had a complete histologic response. After chemotherapy, correlation was r = 0.716 between final histologic and sonographic sizes. Compared with histologic residual tumors, sonography had 4 false-negative results, 3 false-positive results, and 27 true-positive results (sensitivity, 87%), with no false-negative results among a subgroup of tumors of 7 mm and larger (sensitivity, 100%). The 3 cases with false-positive results were histologic fibrosis or biopsy changes. Mean speed-weighted density was 0.015 before and 0.0082 after chemotherapy (P = .03). After chemotherapy, vascularity was less common within (P = .06) or adjacent to (P = .009) masses or in tumor sites (P = .05). Prechemotherapy variables of gray scale characteristics and vascularity were compared with final histologic size, and all had P > .20. CONCLUSIONS: Postchemotherapy sensitivity of sonography was high for residual tumors of 7 mm or larger. Correlation was moderate between histologic and sonographic final tumor sizes. False-positive results were caused by fibrosis or biopsy-related changes. False-negative results occurred with residual tumor size of 6 mm or smaller. After chemotherapy, vascularity usually decreased, and this was not specific for complete response. Before chemotherapy, no vascular or gray scale feature at initial imaging predicted complete responders."

However, each entity displays its own spectrum of clinical aggressiveness. Treatment success varies widely and is not predictable. Since galectins are involved in oncogenesis and the physiology of immune cells, we investigated whether galectin-1 and galectin-3 immunohistochemical expression could differ in 25 normal lymphoid tissues, 42 non-Hodgkins and 14 Hodgkins lymphomas. Immunohistochemical galectin expression was submitted to semi-quantitative and quantitative (computer-assisted microscopy) evaluations. This study is completed by an analysis (by means of quantitative RT-PCR) of galectin-3 mRNA expression in 3 normal lymph nodes, 3 follicular lymphomas (FLs) and 3 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). The data show that in normal lymphoid tissue, lymphocytes do not express galectin-1 and rarely express galectin-3. In contrast, galectin-3 was expressed in 8 of the 16 DLBCL cases and in 1 of the 8 FL cases. Furthermore, galectin-3 mRNA was expressed 3 times more in the DLBCLs than in the FLs. While the blood vessel walls of the lymphomas expressed galectin-1, the vessel walls of normal lymphoid tissues did not. This expression of galectin-1 in blood vessel walls was correlated with vascular density. The present study thus shows that DLBCL can be distinguished from normal lymphoid tissue and other lymphomas on the basis of galectin-3 expression."

Since the node set of a cell-graph can include a cluster of cells as well as individual ones, it enables working with low-cost, low-magnification photomicrographs. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it is shown that without establishing a pairwise spatial relation between the cells (i.e., the edges of a cell-graph), neither the spatial distribution of the cells nor the texture analysis of the images yields accurate results for tissue level diagnosis of brain cancer called malignant glioma. Second, this work defines a set of global metrics by processing the entire cell-graph to capture tissue level information coded into the histopathological images. In this work, the results are obtained on the photomicrographs of 646 archival brain biopsy samples of 60 different patients. It is shown that the global metrics of cell-graphs distinguish cancerous tissues from noncancerous ones with high accuracy (at least 99 percent accuracy for healthy tissues with lower cellular density level, and at least 92 percent accuracy for benign tissues with similar high cellular density level such as nonneoplastic reactive/inflammatory conditions)."

Forty-eight patients referred for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pancreas were included in the study. In addition to the standard protocol, axial pre-contrast SSFP slices of the pancreas were acquired. The standard of reference was defined as based on all imaging data other than SSFP, histopathology, surgery, and/or clinical follow-up. A randomized consensus reading of the SSFP data sets was retrospectively conducted by two board-certified radiologists. The presence of pancreatic lesions, local infiltration, and lymph node metastases was evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. The overall sensitivity and specificity of SSFP were 0.93 and 0.77, respectively. Comparable values were achieved for lymph node detection (0.88/0.91) and assessment of vascular infiltration (0.94/0.91). The mean area under the ROC curve (Az) was 0.91. Owing to its potential to detect vascular infiltration and the rapid acquisition time, SSFP imaging should be supplemented as part of a standard MR protocol of the pancreas."

Concepts such as the ""lobule,"" the ""portal unit"" and the ""acinus"" remain debatable. This study investigates the modular microarchitecture on the basis of the lobular concept. Using alkaline phosphatase activity as a histochemical marker, modules could be recognized clearly. In autopsy specimens of human liver, modules were traced through sequential cryosections, and a ""secondary"" module having a height of 1.9 mm, a surface of 14.7 mm(2), and a volume of 5.1 mm(3) was reconstructed three-dimensionally. It was subdivided into 14 ""primary"" modules by portal tracts and vascular septa and by a common draining central venular tree. Primary modules were polyhedral, with seven to nine facets, having heights from 0.3 to 0.9 mm, surface areas from 1.7 to 5.0 mm(2), and volumes from 0.1 to 0.9 mm(3). Such variation in shape and size is considered an important part of the modular organization of the human liver. In conclusion, the findings on the three-dimensionality and microcirculation of liver modules support and extend the lobular concept and, at the same time, make apparent the shortcomings of the concepts of acinar and portal units. The results of this study should permit a better interpretation of histological sections of normal and pathological liver and provide a basis for understanding the metabolic heterogeneity of liver cells and their functional integration into parenchymal units."

One prominent feature useful for melanoma detection in dermoscopy images is the asymmetric blotch (asymmetric structureless area). METHOD: Using both relative and absolute colors, blotches are detected in this research automatically by using thresholds in the red and green color planes. Several blotch indices are computed, including the scaled distance between the largest blotch centroid and the lesion centroid, ratio of total blotch areas to lesion area, ratio of largest blotch area to lesion area, total number of blotches, size of largest blotch, and irregularity of largest blotch. RESULTS: The effectiveness of the absolute and relative color blotch features was examined for melanoma/benign lesion discrimination over a dermoscopy image set containing 165 melanomas (151 invasive melanomas and 14 melanomas in situ) and 347 benign lesions (124 nevocellular nevi without dysplasia and 223 dysplastic nevi) using a leave-one-out neural network approach. Receiver operating characteristic curve results are shown, highlighting the sensitivity and specificity of melanoma detection. Statistical analysis of the blotch features are also presented. CONCLUSION: Neural network and statistical analysis showed that the blotch detection method was somewhat more effective using relative color than using absolute color. The relative-color blotch detection method gave a diagnostic accuracy of about 77%."

It is experimentally difficult to reconstruct the entire vascular circuit of any organ because of the enormity of the vessels. The objective of the present study was to develop a novel method for the reconstruction of the full coronary vascular tree from partial measurements. Our method includes the use of data on those parts of the tree that are measured to extrapolate the data on those parts that are missing. Specifically, a two-step approach was employed in the reconstruction of the entire coronary arterial tree down to the capillary level. Vessels > 40 microm were reconstructed from cast data while vessels < 40 microm were reconstructed from histological data. The cast data were reconstructed one-bifurcation at a time while histological data were reconstructed one-sub-tree at a time by ""cutting"" and ""pasting"" of data from measured to missing vessels. The reconstruction algorithm yielded a full arterial tree down to the first capillary bifurcation with 1.9, 2.04 and 1.15 million vessel segments for the right coronary artery (RCA), left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) trees, respectively. The node-to-node connectivity along with the diameter and length of every vessel segment was determined. Once the full tree was reconstructed, we automated the assignment of order numbers, according to the diameter-defined Strahler system, to every vessel segment in the tree. Consequently, the diameters, lengths, number of vessels, segments-per-element ratio, connectivity and longitudinal matrices were determined for every order number. The present model establishes a morphological foundation for future analysis of blood flow in the coronary circulation."

Epub 2005 Aug 1.,Nadkarni SK,Circulation,2005,2005/08/03,PMC2957879,NIHMS237555,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.520098,"BACKGROUND: A method capable of determining atherosclerotic plaque composition and measuring plaque viscoelasticity can provide valuable insight into intrinsic features associated with plaque rupture and can enable the identification of high-risk lesions. In this article, we describe a new optical technique, laser speckle imaging (LSI), that measures an index of plaque viscoelasticity. We evaluate the potential of LSI for characterizing atherosclerotic plaque. METHODS AND RESULTS: Time-varying helium-neon laser speckle images were acquired from 118 aortic plaque specimens from 14 human cadavers under static and deforming conditions (0 to 200 microm/s). Temporal fluctuations in the speckle patterns were quantified by exponential fitting of the normalized cross-correlation of sequential frames in each image series of speckle patterns to obtain the exponential decay time constant, tau. The decorrelation time constants of thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFA) (tau=47.5+/-19.2 ms) were significantly lower than those of other atherosclerotic lesions (P<0.001), and the sensitivity and specificity of the LSI technique for identifying TCFAs were >90%. Speckle decorrelation time constants demonstrated strong correlation with histological measurements of plaque collagen (R=0.73, P<0.0001), fibrous cap thickness (R=0.87, P<0.0001), and necrotic core area (R=-0.81, P<0.0001). Under deforming conditions (10 to 200 microm/s), tau correlated well with cap thickness in necrotic core fibroatheromas (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of speckle decorrelation time constant from laser speckle images provides an index of plaque viscoelasticity and facilitates the characterization of plaque type. Our results demonstrate that LSI is a highly sensitive technique for characterizing plaque and identifying thin-cap fibroatheromas."

The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that: 1. CMs are metabolically heterogeneous. 2. The structurally normal appearing perilesional zone is characterized by similar metabolic abnormalities as the CM. METHODS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) in combination with tissue segmentation was performed on eight patients with NE and CMs and 19 age matched controls. In controls, NAA, Cr, Cho,NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho of all voxels of a given lobe were expressed as a function of white matter content and thresholds for pathological values determined by calculating the 95% prediction intervals. These thresholds were used to identify metabolically abnormal voxels within the CM and in the perilesional zone. RESULTS: 30% of all voxels in the CMs were abnormal, most frequently because of decreases of NAA or increases of Cho. Abnormal voxels tended to form metabolically heterogeneous clusters interspersed in metabolically normal regions. Furthermore, 15% of all voxels in the perilesional zone were abnormal, the most frequent being decreases of NAA and Cr. CONCLUSION: In CMs metabolically normal regions are interspersed with metabolically heterogeneous abnormal regions. Metabolic abnormalities in the perilesional zone share several characteristics of CMs and might therefore represent areas with microscopic malformations and/or intrinsic epileptogenicity."

In the low megahertz range, ultrasonic propagation in cortical bone depends on anisotropic elastic tissue properties, porosity and the cortical geometry (e.g., thickness). We investigated 10 human radius samples from a previous biaxial transmission study using a 50-MHz scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) and synchrotron radiation microcomputed tomography. The relationships between low-frequency axial transmission sound speed at 1 and 2 MHz, structural properties (cortical width Ct.Wi, porosity, Haversian canal density and material properties (acoustic impedance, mineral density) on site-matched cross-sections were investigated. Significant linear multivariate regression models (1 MHz: R(2) = 0.84, p < 10(-4), root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 38 m/s, 2 MHz: R(2) = 0.65, p < 10(-4), RMSE = 48 m/s) were found for the combination of Ct.Wi with porosity and impedance. A new model was derived that accounts for the nonlinear dispersion relation with Ct.Wi and predicts axial transmission velocities measured at different ultrasonic frequencies (R(2) = 0.69, p < 10(-4), RMSE = 52 m/s)."

Routine thin-sectioning needs equipment, it is time-consuming, expensive and cause sample wastage during sectioning. The acetate peel technique used for microscopic examinations of carbonate rocks and fossils was modified and successfully adapted for teeth. DESIGN: A human tooth was embedded in resin block; the surface to be peeled was ground and polished with carborundum powder on a glass plate using water. The polished surface was etched, washed, and dried. The dry surface was flooded with acetone and a piece of acetate film was placed over it. As the acetone evaporated, the film settled down to take the shape of micro relief produced by etching. The film dried in 10--15 min. It was pulled off the surface and mounted between two glass slides for examination under microscope. RESULTS: This technique enabled making numerous sequential surface replicas (peels) from a tooth, especially from fully mineralised enamel without routine decalcifying, dehydrating, sawing, and mounting processes. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained with the stained peels, showed that this technique is an efficient way to study gross and fine structures of etched dental hard tissues surfaces and restoration-cavity marginal integrity with three-dimensional detail."

Epub 2005 Aug 11.,Skaane P,Radiology,2005,2005/08/16,,,10.1148/radiol.2371041605,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively compare screen-film and full-field digital mammography with soft-copy interpretation for reader performance in detection and classification of breast lesions in women in a screening program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Regional ethics committee approved the study; signed patient consents were obtained. Two-view mammograms were obtained with digital and screen-film systems at previous screening studies. Six readers interpreted images. Interpretation included Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) and five-level probability-of-malignancy scores. A case was one breast, with two standard views acquired with both screen-film mammography and digital mammography. The standard for an examination with normal findings was classification of normal (category 1) assigned by two independent readers; for cases with benign findings, the standard was benign results at diagnostic work-up in patients who were recalled. Cases with normal or benign findings that manifested as neither interval cancer nor as cancer at subsequent screening were considered the standard. All cancers were confirmed histologically. Images were interpreted by readers in two sessions 5 weeks apart; the same case was not seen twice in any session. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and, for a given true-positive fraction, 2 x 2 table analysis and the McNemar test were used. For binary outcome, classification of BI-RADS category 3 or higher was defined as positive for cancer. RESULTS: Cases with proved findings (n = 232) were displayed: 46 with cancers, 88 with benign findings, and 98 with normal findings. ROC analysis for all readers and all cases revealed a higher area under ROC curve (A(z)) for digital mammography (0.916) than for screen-film mammography (0.887) (P = .22). Five of six readers had a higher performance rating with digital mammography; one of five demonstrated a significant difference in favor of digital mammography with A(z) values; two showed a significant difference in favor of digital mammography with ROC analysis for a given false-positive fraction (P = .01 and .03, respectively). For cases with cancer, digital mammography resulted in correct classification of an average of three additional cancers per reader. For digital versus screen-film mammography, 2 x 2 table analysis for cancers revealed a higher true-positive rate; for benign masses, a higher true-negative rate. Neither of these differences nor any others from analysis of subgroups between the modalities were significant. CONCLUSION: Digital mammography allowed correct classification of more breast cancers than did screen-film mammography. A(z) value was higher for digital mammography; this difference was not significant."

In breast tissue, scattering of red to near infrared (NIR) light dominates absorption and NIR light may penetrate several centimeters through the breast. Optical mammography avoids the use of ionizing radiation and offers the power of diffuse optical spectroscopy. However, because of strong light scattering, spatial resolution of optical mammography is generally low. The paper reviews the results of a clinical study on scanning time-domain optical mammography comprising 154 patients carrying a total of 102 carcinomas validated by histology. Ninety two of these tumors were detected in optical mammograms retrospectively and for 87 of the detected tumors optical properties and tissue parameters were derived. In addition developments on instrumentation and data analysis are covered and possible improvements of optical mammography are briefly discussed."

Characteristic vessel tortuosity abnormalities appear early during tumor development, affect initially healthy vessels, spread beyond the confines of tumor margins, and do not simply mirror tissue perfusion. The ability to detect and quantify tortuosity abnormalities on high-resolution magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images offers a new approach to the noninvasive diagnosis of malignancy. This report evaluates a computerized, statistical method of analyzing the shapes of vessels extracted from MRA in diagnosing cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The regional vasculature of 34 healthy subjects was compared with the tumor-associated vasculature of 30 brain tumors before surgical resection. The operator performing the analysis was blinded to the diagnosis. Vessels were segmented from an MRA of each subject, a region of interest was defined in each tumor patient and was mapped to all healthy controls, and a statistical analysis of vessel shape measures was then performed over the region of interest. Many difficult cases were included, such as pinpoint, hemorrhagic, and irradiated tumors, as were hypervascular benign tumors. Tumors were identified as benign or malignant on the basis of histological evaluation. RESULTS: A discriminant analysis performed at the study's conclusion successfully classified all but one of the 30 tumors as benign or malignant on the basis of vessel tortuosity. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative, statistical measures of vessel shape offer a new approach to the diagnosis and staging of disease. Although the methods developed under the current report must be tested against a new series of cases, initial results are promising."

Epub 2004 Dec 15.,Sirin S,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,2005,2005/10/06,,,10.1016/j.clineuro.2004.11.007,"OBJECTIVE: Epidermoid tumors have similar radiologic characteristics with arachnoid cysts on routine imaging techniques. Since they warrant different therapeutic interventions, it is essential to differentiate the two pathologies and to assess operative results. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to define the MR characteristics of epidermoid tumors in posterior fossa particularly on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 10-year period, we operated 19 cases with epidermoid tumor of posterior fossa. The localization of the epidermoids was cerebellopontine angle in 16 patients, within the fourth ventricle in 2 patients and pineal region in 1 patient. Neuroimaging included CT in all patients, conventional MR in 14 patients and FLAIR and DWI in the last 6 patients. RESULTS: In the first 13 cases, diagnosis of epidermoid tumor was difficult on CT and conventional MR. Epidermoids appeared as heterogeneous hyperintense lesions on FLAIR and homogenous hyperintense lesions on DWI in the last 6 patients. While total resection of the tumor was achieved in 17 patients, subtotal resection was performed in 2 patients. Histopathological examinations of the specimens revealed epidermoid tumor in all cases. CONCLUSION: Advances in neuroradiology provide us advantages for planning the treatment modalities in epidermoid tumors of the posterior fossa. The difficulties in preoperative differential diagnosis and judgment for reoperation in the postoperative course have been decreased particularly via FLAIR and DWI."

PNEC occur either singly or in clusters called neuroepithelial bodies. Our aim was to characterize the three dimensional morphology of PNEC, their distribution, and their relationship to the epithelial nerves in whole mounts of adult human bronchi using confocal microscopy. METHODS: Bronchi were resected from non-diseased portions of a lobe of human lung obtained from 8 thoracotomy patients (Table 1) undergoing surgery for the removal of lung tumors. Whole mounts were stained with antibodies to reveal all nerves (PGP 9.5), sensory nerves (calcitonin gene related peptide, CGRP), and PNEC (PGP 9.5, CGRP and gastrin releasing peptide, GRP). The analysis and rendition of the resulting three-dimensional data sets, including side-projections, was performed using NIH-Image software. Images were colorized and super-imposed using Adobe Photoshop. RESULTS: PNEC were abundant but not homogenously distributed within the epithelium, with densities ranging from 65/mm2 to denser patches of 250/mm2, depending on the individual wholemount. Rotation of 3-D images revealed a complex morphology; flask-like with the cell body near the basement membrane and a thick stem extending to the lumen. Long processes issued laterally from its base, some lumenal and others with feet-like processes. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was present in about 20% of PNEC, mainly in the processes. CGRP-positive nerves were sparse, with some associated with the apical part of the PNEC. CONCLUSION: Our 3D-data demonstrates that PNEC are numerous and exhibit a heterogeneous peptide content suggesting an active and diverse PNEC population."

This paper presents a new approach referred to as augmented virtuality (AV) for displaying intraoperative views of the operative field over three-dimensional (3-D) multimodal preoperative images onto an external screen during surgery. A calibrated stereovision system was set up between the surgical microscope and the binocular tubes. Three-dimensional surface meshes of the operative field were then generated using stereopsis. These reconstructed 3-D surface meshes were directly displayed without any additional geometrical transform over preoperative images of the patient in the physical space. Performance evaluation was achieved using a physical skull phantom. Accuracy of the reconstruction method itself was shown to be within 1 mm (median: 0.76 mm +/- 0.27), whereas accuracy of the overall approach was shown to be within 3 mm (median: 2.29 mm +/- 0.59), including the image-to-physical space registration error. We report the results of six surgical cases where AV was used in conjunction with augmented reality. AV not only enabled vision beyond the cortical surface but also gave an overview of the surgical area. This approach facilitated understanding of the spatial relationship between the operative field and the preoperative multimodal 3-D images of the patient."

Although the potential contribution of HA in aneurysms of different vessels has been studied intensively, no data are available about the alteration of the HA content in the extracellular matrix of intracranial aneurysms. The aim of the study was to determine the hyaluronan content in the wall of human cerebral arteries. METHODS: A biotinylated aggrecan fragment that binds specifically to HA was used to stain samples from cerebral aneurysms (n = 11) to compare the HA content to non-aneurysmal arteries of patients who had intracranial aneurysm (n = 11), and to histologically normal arteries of patients who had expired from non-vascular diseases (n = 14). Digital microscopic densitometry was used for the quantitative analysis of the hyaluronan content in these samples. RESULTS: The highest level (169.5 +/- 7.9) was detected in aneurysms, while the HA-level of non-aneurysmal vessels was lower (130.2 +/- 16.8). Both vessel groups contained significantly higher HA than the normal cerebral arteries (32.9 +/- 2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that an elevated hyaluronan level in the extracellular matrix may affect the cerebral arterial wall architecture. It is reasonable to suppose that the increased hyaluronan content creates a viscoelastic ECM which might improve the biomechanical resistance of the thinned vessel wall."

METHODS: A total of 32 eyes of 16 patients (10 Sjogren's syndrome and six non-Sjogren's syndrome) and 19 eyes of 10 age-matched controls were studied. Sensitivity of the central cornea was measured by the Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer. The morphology of corneal nerves was studied by in vivo confocal microscopy (ConfoScan 2.0, Fortune Technologies Srl, Vigonza (PD), Italy). Sub-basal epithelial nerve plexus, subepithelial nerve plexus, and stromal nerves were localized and evaluated for the number of nerves, thickness, reflectivity, and tortuosity for each frame. RESULTS: The mean corneal sensitivity of dry eye patients (5.6 mm/grs/S) was found significantly lower than that of the control (5.0 mm/grs/S) group (P<0.01). Although the subepithelial nerves were thicker in dry eyes (mean: 6.38+/-1.18 microm) than control eyes (mean: 5.72+/-1.27 microm), this difference was not significant (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Decreased corneal sensitivity is not associated with morphological changes of corneal nerves in dry eyes."

We applied this algorithm to capture non-rigid deformation between digital images of histological slides and digital flat-bed scanned images of cryotomed sections of the larynx, and carried out validation experiments to measure the effectiveness of the algorithm. The implementation was carried out by extending the open-source Insight ToolKit software. In diagnostic imaging of cancer of the larynx, imaging modalities sensitive to both anatomy (such as MRI and CT) and function (PET) are valuable. However, these modalities differ in their capability to discriminate the margins of tumor. Gold standard tumor margins can be obtained from histological images from cryotomed sections of the larynx. Unfortunately, the process of freezing, fixation, cryotoming and staining the tissue to create histological images introduces non-rigid deformations and significant contrast changes. We demonstrate that the non-rigid registration algorithm we present is able to capture these deformations and the algorithm allows us to align histological images with scanned images of the larynx. Our non-rigid registration algorithm constructs a deformation field to warp one image onto another. The algorithm measures image similarity using a mutual information similarity criterion, and avoids spurious deformations due to noise by constraining the estimated deformation field with a linear elastic regularization term. The finite element method is used to represent the deformation field, and our implementation enables us to assign inhomogeneous material characteristics so that hard regions resist internal deformation whereas soft regions are more pliant. A gradient descent optimization strategy is used and this has enabled rapid and accurate convergence to the desired estimate of the deformation field. A further acceleration in speed without cost of accuracy is achieved by using an adaptive mesh refinement strategy."

Epub 2005 Jun 3.,Arsigny V,Med Image Anal,2005,2005/06/14,,,10.1016/j.media.2005.04.001,"We describe in this paper a novel kind of geometrical transformations, named polyrigid and polyaffine. These transformations efficiently code for locally rigid or affine deformations with a small number of intuitive parameters. They can describe compactly large rigid or affine movements, unlike most free-form deformation classes. Very flexible, this tool can be readily adapted to a large variety of situations, simply by tuning the number of rigid or affine components and the number of parameters describing their regions of influence. The displacement of each spatial position is defined by a continuous trajectory that follows a differential equation which averages the influence of each rigid or affine component. We show that the resulting transformations are diffeomorphisms, smooth with respect to their parameters. We devise a new and flexible numerical scheme to allow a trade-off between computational efficiency and closeness to the ideal diffeomorphism. Our algorithms are implemented within the Insight Toolkit, whose generic programming style offers rich facilities for prototyping. In this context, we derive an effective optimization strategy of the transformations which demonstrates that this new tool is highly suitable for inference. The whole framework is exemplified successfully with the registration of histological slices. This choice is challenging, because these data often present locally rigid deformations added during their acquisition, and can also present a loss of matter, which makes their registration even more difficult. Powerful and flexible, this new tool opens up large perspectives, in non-rigid 3D rigid registration as well as in shape statistics."

There, T3S effectors exert many effects, such as cellular invasion or modulation of host immune responses. Studying spatiotemporal orchestrated secretion of various effectors has been difficult without disrupting their functions. Here we developed a new approach using Shigella flexneri T3S as a model to investigate bacterial translocation of individual effectors via multidimensional time-lapse microscopy. We demonstrate that direct fluorescent labeling of tetracysteine motif-tagged effectors IpaB and IpaC is possible in situ without loss of function. Studying the T3S kinetics of IpaB and IpaC ejection from individual bacteria, we found that the entire pools of IpaB and IpaC were released concurrently upon host cell contact, and that 50% of each effector was secreted in 240 s. This method allows an unprecedented analysis of the spatiotemporal events during T3S."

We studied the spatial patterns of these pathological changes parallel to the pia mater in gyri of the temporal lobe in four cases of NIFID. Both the NI and SN occurred in clusters that were regularly distributed parallel to the pia mater, the cluster sizes of the SN being significantly greater than those of the NI. In a significant proportion of areas studied, there was a spatial correlation between the clusters of NI and those of the SN and with the density of the surviving neurons. In addition, the clusters of surviving neurons were negatively correlated (out of phase) with the clusters of glial cell nuclei. The pattern of clustering of these histological features suggests that there is degeneration of the cortico-cortical projections in NIFID leading to the formation of NI and SN within the same vertical columns of cells. The glial cell reaction may be a response to the loss of neurons rather than to the appearance of the NI or SN."

By means of site-matched Raman microspectroscopy, acoustic microscopy and nanoindentation the structure, chemical composition and anisotropic elasticity of individual lamellae in secondary osteons were investigated. Acoustic impedance images (911-MHz) and two-dimensional Raman spectra were acquired in sections of human femoral bone. The samples were prepared with orientations at various observation angles theta relative to the femoral long axis. Nanoindentations provided local estimations of the elastic modulus and landmarks necessary for spatial fusion of the acoustic and spectral Raman images. Phosphate nu(1) (961 cm(-1)) and amide I (1665 cm(-1)) band images representing spatial distributions of mineral and collagen were fused with the acoustic images. Acoustic impedance was correlated with the indentation elastic modulus E(IT) (R(2)=0.61). Both parameters are sensitive to elastic tissue anisotropy. The lowest values were obtained in the direction perpendicular to the femoral long axis. Acoustic images exhibit a characteristic bimodal lamellar pattern of alternating high and low impedance values. Since this undulation was not associated with a variation of the phosphate nu(1)-band intensity in the Raman images, it was attributed to variations of the lamellar orientation. After threshold segmentation and conversion to elastic modulus the orientation and transverse isotropic elastic constants were derived for individual ensembles of apparent thin and thick lamellae. Our results suggest that this model represents the effective anisotropic properties of an asymmetric twisted plywood structure made of transverse isotropic fibrils. This is the first report that proves experimentally the ability of acoustic microscopy to map tissue elasticity in two dimensions with micrometer resolution. The combination with Raman microspectroscopy provides a unique way to study bone and mineral metabolism and the relation with mechanical function at the ultrastructural tissue level."

The first-order gray level statistics of a digitized light microscopic nuclear image may be influenced by variations in the image input conditions. Therefore, we have previously standardized the nuclear gray level mean value and standard deviation. However, there is a clear relation between nuclear DNA content, area, first-order statistics, and texture. For nuclei with approximately the same DNA content, the mean gray level increases with an increasing nuclear area. The aims of the present methodical work were to study: (1) whether the prognostic value of adaptive textural features varies with nuclear area, and (2) the effect of standardizing nuclear first-order statistics. METHODS: Nuclei from 134 cases of ovarian cancer were grouped into intervals according to nuclear area. Adaptive features were extracted from two different image sets, i.e., standardized and non-standardized nuclear images. RESULTS: The prognostic value of adaptive textural features varied strongly with nuclear area. A standardization of the first-order statistics significantly reduced this prognostic information. Several single features discriminated the two classes of cancer with a correct classification rate of 70%. CONCLUSION: Nuclei having an area between 2000-4999 pixels contained most of the class distance information between the good and poor prognosis classes of cancer. By considering the relation between nuclear area and texture, we avoided a loss of information caused by standardizing the first-order statistics and mixing data from cells having different nuclear area."

By comparing the data obtained from all the examined cases, important conclusions were drawn regarding the influence of tension and pressure distribution on the structural integrity and biomechanics of the prosthesis, as well as the acetabular wear and tear, in order to assess its reliability. The experimentally determined tension and distortion status at the acetabular bone-metal armour interface, lead to the wear and tear phenomenon, which can be explained by three mechanisms and theories incompletely reflecting the overall process. The histopathologic study of the acetabular bone tissue using FEM (finite elements method) on surgically removed specimens will probably lead to the identification of a series of factors that could reduce the rate of the wear and tear process."

Indeed most lipid-modified proteins are localized to membranes where they associate with multiprotein signaling complexes. Acylation and prenylation are the two common categories of lipidation. The enzymology and pharmacology of prenylation are well understood but relatively very little is known about palmitoylation, the most common form of acylation. One distinguishing characteristic of palmitoylation is that it is a dynamic modification. To understand more about how palmitoylation is regulated, we fused palmitoylation substrates to fluorescent proteins and reported their subcellular distribution and trafficking. We used automated high-throughput fluorescence microscopy and a specialized computer algorithm to image and measure the fraction of palmitoylation reporter on the plasma membrane versus the cytoplasm. Using this system we determined the residence half-life of palmitate on the dipalmitoyl substrate peptide from GAP43 as well as the EC(50) for 2-bromopalmitate, a common inhibitor of palmitoylation."

This chapter describes a novel high-resolution screening (HRS) platform that is able to acquire large sets of data at a high rate and light microscope resolution using specific ""reporter cells,"" cultured in multiwell plates. To harvest extensive morphological and molecular information in these automated screens, we have constructed a general analysis pipeline that is capable of assigning scores to multiparameter-based comparisons between treated cells and controls.

Protein translocation assays can be formatted as agonist assays, in which compounds are tested for their ability to promote protein translocation, or as antagonist assays, in which compounds are tested for their ability to inhibit protein translocation caused by a known agonist. Protein translocation assays are high-content, high-throughput assays primarily used for profiling of lead series, primary screening of compound libraries, and as readouts for gene-silencing studies using siRNAs.

However, the recent advent of whole slide digital scanners has made histopathological tissue specimens amenable to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). In this paper, we present a CAD system to assist pathologists by automatically detecting prostate cancer from digitized images of prostate histological specimens. Automated diagnosis on very large high resolution images is done via a multi-resolution scheme similar to the manner in which a pathologist isolates regions of interest on a glass slide. Nearly 600 image texture features are extracted and used to perform pixel-wise Bayesian classification at each image scale to obtain corresponding likelihood scenes. Starting at the lowest scale, we apply the AdaBoost algorithm to combine the most discriminating features, and we analyze only pixels with a high combined probability of malignancy at subsequent higher scales. The system was evaluated on 22 studies by comparing the CAD result to a pathologist's manual segmentation of cancer (which served as ground truth) and found to have an overall accuracy of 88%. Our results show that (1) CAD detection sensitivity remains consistently high across image scales while CAD specificity increases with higher scales, (2) the method is robust to choice of training samples, and (3) the multi-scale cascaded approach results in significant savings in computational time."

This is especially desirable considering the large number of tissue slides that are currently analyzed manually - a laborious and time-consuming task. Our methodology is novel in that texture-based classification is performed using a hierarchical classifier within a multi-scale framework. Pyramidal decomposition is used to reduce an image into its constituent scales. The cascaded image analysis across multiple scales is similar to the manner in which pathologists analyze histopathology. Nearly 600 different image texture features at multiple orientations are extracted at every pixel at each image scale. At each image scale the classifier only analyzes those image pixels that have been determined to be tumor at the preceding lower scale. Results of quantitative evaluation on 20 patient studies indicate (1) an overall accuracy of over 90% and (2) an approximate 8-fold savings in terms of computational time. Both the AdaBoost and Decision Tree classifiers were considered and in both cases tumor detection sensitivity was found to be relatively constant across different scales. Detection specificity was however found to increase at higher scales reflecting the availability of additional discriminatory information.

The underlying mechanisms that regulate such interactions remain largely unknown. NG2 is a transmembrane proteoglycan whose presence on transformed cells has been demonstrated to increase proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. To study the effects of NG2 during tumour growth and progression, we engineered an NG2 positive human glioma cell line (U251-NG2) from parental NG2 negative cells (U251-WT) and implanted both cell types stereotactically into immunodeficient nude rat brains. The tumours were longitudinally monitored in vivo using multispectral MRI employing two differently sized contrast agents (Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gadomer) to assess vascular leakiness, vasogenic oedema, tumour volumes and necrosis. Comparisons of Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gadomer revealed differences in their spatial distribution in the U251-NG2 and U251-WT tumours. The U251-NG2 tumours exhibited a higher leakiness of the larger molecular weight Gadomer and displayed a stronger vasogenic oedema (69.9 +/- 15.2, P = 0.018, compared to the controls (10.7 +/- 7.7). Moreover, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed that the U251-NG2 tumours had a higher microvascular density (11.81 +/- 0.54; P = 0.0010) compared to controls (5.76 +/- 0.87), with vessels that displayed larger gaps between the endothelial cells. Thus, tumour cells can regulate both the function and structure of the host-derived tumour vasculature through NG2 expression, suggesting a role for NG2 in the cross-talk between tumour-host compartments."

Therefore, the presentation of sequential morphological changes occurring in the embryo (4D visualization) is essential for understanding the complex morphogenetic events and the underlying mechanisms. Until recently, 3D visualization of embryonic structures was possible only by reconstruction from serial histological sections, which was tedious and time-consuming. During the past two decades, 3D imaging techniques have made significant advances thanks to the progress in imaging and computer technologies, computer graphics, and other related techniques. Such novel tools have enabled precise visualization of the 3D topology of embryonic structures and to demonstrate spatiotemporal 4D sequences of organogenesis. Here, we describe a project in which staged human embryos are imaged by the magnetic resonance (MR) microscope, and 3D images of embryos and their organs at each developmental stage were reconstructed based on the MR data, with the aid of computer graphics techniques. On the basis of the 3D models of staged human embryos, we constructed a data set of 3D images of human embryos and made movies to illustrate the sequential process of human morphogenesis. Furthermore, a computer-based self-learning program of human embryology is being developed for educational purposes, using the photographs, histological sections, MR images, and 3D models of staged human embryos."

METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SST Groups N, B, and H trials between October 1999 and September 2001 and assigned to the surgery arm had surgically removed choroidal neovascularization sent to the SST Pathology Center. Grossly intact specimens were sectioned serially for 2-dimensional reconstruction and were assigned to growth pattern groups based on topographic mapping of the location of cellular components relative to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE): sub-RPE, subretinal, combined, or indeterminate. These features were compared with preoperative fluorescein angiographic features. The histological choroidal neovascularization growth pattern was compared with preoperative VAs. RESULTS: Two-dimensional reconstructions of surgically excised choroidal neovascularization could not be matched point for point to fluorescein angiographic features. Among the 52 specimens selected, the growth pattern could be determined by 2-dimensional reconstruction in 34 instances (65%), including 28 (80%) of 35 Group N specimens, 2 (40%) of 5 Group B specimens, and 4 (33%) of 12 Group H specimens. Among the choroidal neovascularization growth patterns that could be determined from specimens submitted, the majority of Group N specimens were combined, and the majority of Group H specimens were subretinal. In most instances for Group B specimens, the growth pattern was indeterminate. The postoperative abnormalities on fluorescein angiography were generally larger than measurements of excised specimens. The subretinal growth pattern was associated with the smallest decrease in 3-month postoperative average VA. CONCLUSIONS: Among the 52 specimens from the SST with adequate tissue to try to evaluate the growth pattern of the neovascular lesion, 34 had patterns that could be determined. The subretinal growth pattern tended to correspond with lesions that were classic choroidal neovascularization without occult choroidal neovascularization on fluorescein angiography. The most favorable visual outcome occurred if the choroidal neovascularization had a subretinal growth pattern. The combined growth pattern tended to correspond with lesions on fluorescein angiography that had both classic choroidal neovascularization and occult choroidal neovascularization. The conclusions must be viewed within the context that 18 (35%) of the 52 participants could not be characterized for histologic growth pattern."

A TCFA has two main components: these are a large, soft lipid pool and a thin, stiff fibrous cap covering it. Quantification of their morphology and stiffness is essential for monitoring atherosclerosis and quantifying the effect of plaque-stabilizing pharmaceutical treatment. To accomplish this, we have developed a model-based Young's modulus reconstruction method. From a plaque strain elastogram, measured with an intravascular ultrasound catheter, it reconstructs a Young's modulus image of the plaque. To this end, a minimization algorithm automatically varies the morphology and stiffness parameters of a TCFA computer model, until the corresponding computer-simulated strain elastogram resembles the measured strain elastogram. The morphology parameters of the model are the control-points of two deformable Bezier curves; one curve delineates the distal border of the lipid pool region, the other the distal border of the cap region. These component regions are assumed to be homogeneous and their stiffness is characterized by a Young's modulus. Reconstructions from strain elastograms that were 1. simulated using a histology-derived computer TCFA, 2. measured from a physical phantom with a soft lipid pool, and 3. simulated with a computer TCFA, where the complexity of its plaque component borders was increased, demonstrated the superior reconstruction/delineation behavior of this method, compared with a previously developed circular reconstruction method that used only circles for border delineation. Consequently, this method may become a valuable tool for the quantification of both the morphology and stiffness of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque components."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty patients with histopathology-proven hepatocellular carcinoma were selected for this subgroup analysis from a phase-III multicenter study in 235 patients with known or suspected liver lesions. The primary analysis was comparison of the proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma correctly classified and characterized by combined pre-/post-contrast MRI compared with pre-contrast MRI alone or with spiral CT. All images were evaluated on site, and in a blinded reading by three independent readers off site. RESULTS: In the on-site evaluation, the lesions were correctly classified as a malignant tumor with combined MRI in 90.3%, with pre-contrast imaging alone in 82.9% and with spiral CT in 87.8% (n.s.). The proportion of correct characterization (lesion type diagnosis) with combined MRI was 85.4%, 75.6% for pre-contrast imaging, and 77.5% for spiral CT (n.s.), respectively. In the blinded reading, one reader showed a significant increase in the proportion of correctly characterized lesions by 27% (P<0.05). The other two readers showed a reduction in the proportion of correct characterization by 12% and 15%, respectively (n.s.). CONCLUSION: With regard to lesion classification, no difference was found between combined pre-/post-contrast MRI and spiral CT. A non-significant trend in favor of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI with regard to characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma was found, although the CT scans were not optimized as the MRI scans."

However, limitations in acquiring and storing sufficient cadaveric material, recent pressures in training opportunities, and progress in digital image technology have led to advances in virtual or artificial visual means to augment surgical training. For training neurosurgeons, the appearance of reality is still crucial for learning anatomic structures and procedures. We developed a four-dimensional (including time) multilayer digital image reconstruction technology (MIGRT) that allows users to manipulate a ""volumetric"" set of photographic image data from exquisite cadaveric intracranial dissections and to navigate through stages of neurosurgical procedures as the dissection progresses. METHODS: A robotic microscope with two digital cameras was used to capture dissection images, usually in stereoscopic mode. A grid space was created to define positions at which images are captured. Images were acquired from identical angles at the same grid coordinates but at different stages of various dissections. RESULTS: Image data are reconstructed according to the sequence of acquisition into a multilayer image grid system by the MIGRT software. The single interactive, four-dimensional montage is viewable a on common computer platform. CONCLUSION: MIGRT uniquely focuses on capturing anatomic content that preserves natural appearances, including procedure, texture, and color, which is far superior and preferable to images and a reconstructed image environment based on artificial or animated concepts. MIGRT shows time-dependent changes in procedures, provides depth perception by stereoscopy or unique sequential motion, and allows simultaneous interactivity at each step of the procedure."

Histologic samples obtained from 20 consecutive cases of SCC of the vulva with positive inguinal LNM were morphometrically assessed and compared with samples from 20 consecutive cases of vulvar SCC negative for LNM. Computerized morphometry was performed on tumor cells and on adjacent nonneoplastic epithelial cells located 2-4 mm from the tumor margins. Computerized morphometric variables of tumor cell nuclei in patients with negative LNM significantly differed from those in patients with positive LNM. Morphometric differences in nuclear size and contour regularity were detected when comparing the nonneoplastic nuclei adjacent to the tumor of both groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the only independent predictors of LNM were the depth of the invasion (P= 0.005) and the mean nuclear roundness of the nonneoplastic nuclei adjacent to the tumors (P= 0.008). Using these variables, a discriminant score revealed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 86.4% for predicting LNM in SCC of the vulva. Our data suggest that cells from the primary tumors with LNM differ morphometrically from primary tumors with no LNM. In addition, normal epithelial cells adjacent to the tumor express morphometric changes between the two groups. The results of our study justify the need for a prospective study of a larger number of patients to evaluate the reproducibility and the clinical use of the data."

Epub 2006 Jan 9.,Chakravarty MM,Neuroimage,2006,2006/01/13,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.09.041,"Digital and print brain atlases have been used with success to help in the planning of neurosurgical interventions. In this paper, a technique presented for the creation of a brain atlas of the basal ganglia and the thalamus derived from serial histological data. Photographs of coronal histological sections were digitized and anatomical structures were manually segmented. A slice-to-slice nonlinear registration technique was used to correct for spatial distortions introduced into the histological data set at the time of acquisition. Since the histological data were acquired without any anatomical reference (e.g., block-face imaging, post-mortem MRI), this registration technique was optimized to use an error metric which calculates a nonlinear transformation minimizing the mean distance between the segmented contours between adjacent pairs of slices in the data set. A voxel-by-voxel intensity correction field was also estimated for each slice to correct for lighting and staining inhomogeneity. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) histological volume can be viewed in transverse and sagittal directions in addition to the original coronal. Nonlinear transformations used to correct for spatial distortions of the histological data were applied to the segmented structure contours. These contours were then tessellated to create three-dimensional geometric objects representing the different anatomic regions in register with the histological volumes. This yields two alternate representations (one histological and one geometric) of the atlas. To register the atlas to a standard reference MR volume created from the average of 27 T1-weighted MR volumes, a pseudo-MRI was created by setting the intensity of each anatomical region defined in the geometric atlas to match the intensity of the corresponding region of the reference MR volume. This allowed the estimation of a 3D nonlinear transformation using a correlation based registration scheme to fit the atlas to the reference MRI. The result of this procedure is a contiguous 3D histological volume, a set of 3D objects defining the basal ganglia and thalamus, both of which are registered to a standard MRI data set, for use for neurosurgical planning."

The purpose of endovascular brain mapping is to delineate clearly the nonfunctional brain parenchyma when a craniotomy is performed for resection. The nonfunctional brain will be stained with sharp visual margins, differentiating it from the functional, nonstained brain. The authors list four essential criteria for developing an ideal endovascular mapping agent, and they describe seven potential approaches for accomplishing a successful endovascular brain map. METHODS: Four Sprague-Dawley rats and one New Zealand white rabbit were used to determine initial feasibility of the procedure. The animals were anesthetized, and the internal carotid artery was catheterized. Four potential brain mapping agents were infused into the right hemisphere of the five animals. Afterward, the brains were removed and each was analyzed both grossly and histologically. Fluorescein and FD&C Green No. 3 provided good visual clarity and margins, but required blood-brain barrier (BBB) manipulation. Tantalum particles enabled avoidance of BBB manipulation, but provided inadequate visual clarity, probably because of their size. A Sudan black ""cocktail"" provided excellent clarity and margins despite remaining in the brain capillaries. CONCLUSIONS: This is a novel application of the endovascular approach, and has broad potential for clinical neurosurgical brain mapping. The animal models in this study establish the feasibility of the procedure. However, further study is required to demonstrate safety, minimize toxicity, investigate stain durability, and improve the characteristics of potential mapping agents. The authors are planning to conduct future studies for identification of mapping agents that do not require BBB manipulation or vascular occlusion."

STUDY DESIGN: At least 300 tumor cell nuclei per case were measured by means of a digital image analysis system. Fourier amplitudes no. 1 to 15, moments no. 1 to 7 according to Hu, roundness factor, ellipse shape factor, concavity factor, Feret ratio, fractal dimension and bending energy were determined for each nucleus. The discriminatory power of these parameters was tested in three pairwise comparisons: (1) oligodendrogliomas WHO grade II (n = 13) vs. grade III (n = 11), (2) medulloblastomas WHO grade IV (n = 14) vs. anaplastic ependymomas WHO grade III (n = 12), (3) Ki-67-positive vs. Ki-67-negative tumor cell nuclei in the 14 medulloblastomas. RESULTS: When data from Fourier analysis were included in statistical analysis, cross-validated discriminant analysis led to a 100% correct reclassification for the first and for the second pairwise comparison and to a 75% correct reclassification when comparing Ki-67-positive and Ki-67-negative nucleifrom medulloblastomas. Different combinations of the other shape parameters led to a lower percentage of correctly reclassified cases for all three pairwise comparisons, especially when Fourier analysis was not included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Fourier analysis provided an optimal statistical discrimination between different brain tumor entities and between data sets from proliferating and nonproliferating tumor cell nuclei. Since nuclear shape is an important criterion for the investigation of tumors, the application of Fourier analysis is therefore recommended for quantitative histologic investigations in neuro-oncology."

In an attempt to aid in early melanoma diagnosis, we developed an image processing program with the aim to discriminate melanoma from melanocytic nevi, establishing a mathematical model to come up with a melanoma probability. METHODS: Digital images of 132 melanocytic skin lesions (23 melanomas and 109 melanocytic nevi) were studied in features of geometry, color, and color texture. A total of 43 variables were studied for all lesions, e.g., geometry, color texture, sharpness of border, and color variables. Univariate logistic regression analysis followed by ""-2 log likelihood"" test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were used to eliminate inappropriate variables, as the presence of multi-collinearity among variables could cause severe problems in any stepwise variable selection method. Initially, ""-2 log likelihood"" and nonparametric Spearman's rho picked five variables to be included in a multivariate model of prediction. The five-variable model was then reduced to three variables and the performance of each model was tested. The ""jackknife"" method was performed in order to validate the model with the three variables and its accuracy was weighed vs. the five-variable model by receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve plotting. It was concluded that the reduced model did not compromise discriminatory power. RESULTS: Not all variables contributed much to the model, therefore they were progressively eliminated and the model was finally reduced to three covariates of significance. A predictive equation was calculated, incorporating parameters of geometry, color, and color texture as independent covariates for the prediction of melanoma. The proposed model provides melanoma probability with a 60.9% sensitivity and 95.4% specificity of prediction, an overall accuracy of 89.4% (probability level 0.5), and 8% false-negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Through a digital image processing system and the development of a mathematical model of prediction, discrimination between melanomas and melanocytic nevi seems feasible with a high rate of accuracy using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The proposed model is an alternative method to aid in early melanoma diagnosis. Expensive and sophisticated equipment is not required and it can be easily implemented in a reasonably priced portable programmable computer, in order to predict previously undiagnosed skin melanoma before histopathology results confirm diagnosis."

Corticospinal tract degeneration is not a common feature of 4R tauopathies. Our objective was to describe 12 cases with pathologic features similar to those of PSP but with prominent corticospinal tract degeneration. We reviewed the historical records and neuropathologic evaluation using standardized sampling, immunohistochemistry, semiquantitative analysis, image analysis, and electron microscopy. The mean age at onset and illness duration was 71 and 5.7 years, respectively. Eight cases were female. Eleven cases had clinical evidence of prominent upper motor neuron disease plus extrapyramidal features. There was focal parasagittal cortical atrophy involving motor cortex and degeneration of corticospinal tract with sparing of lower motor neurons like in primary lateral sclerosis. Prominent tau pathology was found in oligodendrocytes in motor cortex, subjacent white matter, and corticospinal tract characterized by globular cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions that were immunoreactive for 4R tau. The clinicopathologic features of these 12 cases expand the spectrum of 4R tauopathies."

The human TLR3 recognizes foreign-derived double-stranded RNA and endogenous necrotic cell RNA as ligands. Herein we characterized the contribution of glycosylation to TLR3 structure and function. Exogenous addition of purified extracellular domain of TLR3 (hTLR3 ECD) expressed in human embryonic kidney cells was found to inhibit TLR3-dependent signaling, thus providing a reagent for structural and functional characterization. Approximately 35% of the mass of the hTLR3 ECD was due to posttranslational modification, with N-linked glycosyl groups contributing substantially to the additional mass. Cells treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation, prevented TLR3-induced NF-kappaB activation, confirming that N-linked glycosylation is required for bioactivity of this receptor. Further, mutations in two of these predicted glycosylation sites impaired TLR3 signaling without obviously affecting the expression of the protein. Single-particle structures reconstructed from electron microscopy images and two-dimensional crystallization revealed that hTLR3 ECD forms a horseshoe structure similar to the recently elucidated x-ray structure of the protein expressed in insect cells using baculovirus vectors (Choe, J., Kelker, M. S., and Wilson, I. A. (2005) Science 309, 581-585 and Bell, J. K., Botos, I., Hall, P. R., Askins, J., Shiloach, J., Segal, D. M., and Davies, D. R. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Epub 2006 Jan 10.,Shin YW,Neuroimage,2006,2006/01/13,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.11.017,"Schizophrenia has been suggested to be the result of both macroscopic and microscopic abnormalities in the brain. Although no definitive clinico-pathological correlations have been found to reconcile the many facets inherent in this disorder, the recent development of the magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has allowed us to gather useful information regarding the microcircuitry of the brain. Specifically, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reflects the degree of diffusion barriers and heterosynaptic communication for the brain neurotransmitter. Nineteen patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia and 21 age- and sex-matched control subjects participated in DTI, and the severity of the patients' symptoms was evaluated according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The ADC values were determined and compared between patients and control subjects via voxel-based morphometry. The results show an increased ADC in the bilateral fronto-temporal regions of the schizophrenic patients, as compared with those of the control subjects. In addition, the ADC values in the area of the right insular were correlated with the negative syndromes from the PANSS. Our findings of increased water diffusivity in the fronto-temporal regions of schizophrenic patients and the correlation between negative symptom scales and the ADC in the right insular region indicate that damaged brain microcircuitry might contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These findings contribute towards integrating micro and macrostructural abnormalities and syndromes of schizophrenia."

The usual explanation for the poor surgical outcome is the presence of residual dysplastic tissue missed by the preoperative neuroimaging investigation and therefore not resected during surgery. We apply a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from patients with epilepsy and visually detected FCD to investigate whether (a) VBM is able to detect gray-matter concentration (GMC) abnormalities in patients with FCD, and (b) whether the extent of GMC abnormalities in the brain of these patients differs from the regions observed by using visual inspection. METHODS: We studied 11 patients with visually detected FCD (eight of them with histologic confirmation of FCD). The GMC from each one of these patients was compared with the mean GMC from a control group of 96 normal healthy subjects by using an optimized VBM protocol. RESULTS: Ten of 11 patients showed statistically significant GMC excess, and among patients with GMC excess, only one showed GMC excess that was not exactly correspondent to the visually detected FCD. Seven patients exhibited excess in GMC extending beyond the area of visually detected FCD. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary neuroimaging study suggests that (a) VBM can detect GMC excess in patients with FCD, and (b) GMC excess in these patients can extend to brain areas not visually defined as abnormal. Abnormal areas detected by VBM can possibly correspond to mild malformations of cortical development, supporting the notion that the surgical refractoriness observed in patients with FCD can be due to the incomplete resection of the dysplastic tissue."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the findings in 77 adult patients who underwent liver resections for FNH between October 1989 and September 2001 at our center. HCC within the confines of FNH was found in two patients. We demonstrate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and macroscopic and microscopic findings. RESULTS: Presurgical MRI demonstrated heterogeneous signal characteristics of moderately hyperintense FNH on T2-weighted images and, after i.v. administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, HCC in FNH was barely delineable. Both patients underwent successful right hemihepatectomy to remove the suspicious FNH with diameters of 12 and 14 cm; intralesional HCC diameters were 3 and 5 cm, respectively. Patients could be rapidly dismissed. However, one patient died after recurrence of HCC 1.5 years after surgery, whereas the other patient continues tumor-free 4 years after surgery. Alpha-feto-protein was normal in both patients. CONCLUSION: In FNH with rapid growth tendency and heterogenic MR appearance, surgical removal should be considered to overcome the risk of inadequate therapy in the very rare group of patients with HCC in association with FNH."

Epub 2006 Apr 8.,Ross NE,Med Biol Eng Comput,2006,2006/08/29,,,10.1007/s11517-006-0044-2,"Malaria is a serious global health problem, and rapid, accurate diagnosis is required to control the disease. An image processing algorithm to automate the diagnosis of malaria on thin blood smears is developed. The image classification system is designed to positively identify malaria parasites present in thin blood smears, and differentiate the species of malaria. Images are acquired using a charge-coupled device camera connected to a light microscope. Morphological and novel threshold selection techniques are used to identify erythrocytes (red blood cells) and possible parasites present on microscopic slides. Image features based on colour, texture and the geometry of the cells and parasites are generated, as well as features that make use of a priori knowledge of the classification problem and mimic features used by human technicians. A two-stage tree classifier using backpropogation feedforward neural networks distinguishes between true and false positives, and then diagnoses the species (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale or P. malariae) of the infection. Malaria samples obtained from the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the University of the Witwatersrand Medical School are used for training and testing of the system. Infected erythrocytes are positively identified with a sensitivity of 85% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 81%, which makes the method highly sensitive at diagnosing a complete sample provided many views are analysed. Species were correctly determined for 11 out of 15 samples."
16529894,Assessment of age at death by microscopy: unbiased quantification of secondary osteons in femoral cross sections,"Lynnerup N, Frohlich B, Thomsen JL.",Forensic Sci Int. 2006 May 15;159 Suppl 1:S100-3. doi: 10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.02.023. Epub 2006 Mar 9.,Lynnerup N,Forensic Sci Int,2006,2006/03/15,,,10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.02.023,"The microscopic method of age at death determination was introduced by Kerley in 1965 [E.R. Kerley, The microscopic determination of age in human bone, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol, 23 (1965) 149-163.]. However, even though the method has been revised several times, there remain some fundamental issues concerning the reliability of the methods. This is because several basic histological features seen in a cross section of a bone have to be quantified according to the method, but the definition, and hence quantification, of these features leaves room for subjectivity. In a previous study we found that some of these features (osteon fragments and Haversian canals) could not be identified reliably. Only secondary osteons could be identified with a low inter and intra observer error. Furthermore, since the histological features are quantified in only parts of an entire bone cross section, the selection of these parts or areas is a potential source of bias. Finally, unless an unbiased method is used for addressing features on the borders of the selected areas, this will also introduce error. These issues have not been addressed specifically in previous studies. In this study, we used the methods of stereology to choose the regions of interest, as well as for dealing with border phenomena, and we only counted secondary osteons. Our results show a statistically significant increase in the median number of osteons per area unit with increasing age at death. However, this was after exclusion of one outlier. This result is probably due to the limited sample size (N = 24). As such, this study is preliminary, but does warrant applying the described techniques to a larger sample."

They are a diagnostically challenging subtype of embryonal tumours, whose genetic features are unknown. Primary ependymoblastomas from four children (one boy, three girls; mean age 24.8 months, range 4-41 months) were investigated by comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), to our knowledge constituting the only cohort of this entity studied by cytogenetic means. DNA copy number changes were found in each case, consisting mainly of gains of chromosome 2 as well as losses of chromosomes 6q and 13q (75% each). The tumours showed between one and five aberrations with a mean of 3.25 DNA copy number changes per case, with gains being less frequent than losses (1.25 gains vs 2 losses per case). The youngest patient showed the least imbalances (one), whereas the oldest child presented with the most aberrations (five). Clinical follow-up data were available for three of the four patients. All three had died of their disease after a post-operative survival of 9 months (range 6-14 months). Our CGH data suggest that ependymoblastomas show distinct and fairly consistent chromosomal aberrations."

We also classified small- and medium-sized congenital naevi (CN) into nine subtypes according to their macroscopic and dermoscopic aspects. OBJECTIVES: Because the recognition of dermoscopic features may be instrument dependent, in this study, we wanted to check whether dermoscopic patterns specific for CN can be identified in digital images acquired by means of different instruments. We also wanted to check the validity of our previously proposed classification and assess possible age- and site-dependent variations of dermoscopic patterns and naevus subtypes. PATIENTS/METHODS: Images corresponding to 384 small- or medium-sized CN were collected in eight different centres employing four different instruments. Lesion images were evaluated and checked for the presence of specific dermoscopic criteria, classified, and compared with a database of 350 acquired naevi. RESULTS: Specific and unspecific dermoscopic features were identifiable in images acquired by means of all four instrument types. The mean number of identified features per lesion did not vary according to the instrument employed for the acquisition of the images; however, it was lower for lesions recorded employing low magnifications. The previously proposed classification was easily applied to the whole image database. The variegated naevus type was identified as a highly specific clinical/dermoscopic pattern. Dermoscopic features varied according to age and location. The globular type prevailed in subjects under 11 years of age and on the trunk, whereas the majority of reticular lesions were located on the limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Because definite clinical and histological criteria for the diagnosis of the congenital nature of naevi are lacking, the use of dermoscopy can be of great help in identifying those lesions where the presence of specific dermoscopic features makes the diagnosis of CN more likely. Moreover, dermoscopy can be useful both for the classification of lesions already identified as congenital according to definite clinical and anamnestic data and for a possible correlation of naevus phenotype and dermoscopic patterns to the risk of developing a malignant melanoma in prospective studies."

Neuroimaging and histological studies suggest cellular abnormalities early in the course of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To measure the in vivo chemical profile of gray and white matter tissues in autism. DESIGN: Cross-sectional spectroscopic imaging study comparing 3- to 4-year-old children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with age-matched comparison groups of children with delayed development (DD) and typical development (TD). SETTING: The University of Washington Diagnostic Imaging Sciences Center, Seattle. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five 3- to 4-year-old children with ASD, 12 age-matched children with DD, and 10 age-matched children with TD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimates of gray and white matter concentrations for choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine plus phosphocreatine, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and myo-inositol (mI). Transverse relaxation times for Cho, creatine plus phosphocreatine, and NAA expressed relative to control subjects with TD were examined to evaluate tissue compactness. RESULTS: The children with ASD demonstrated decreased gray matter concentrations of Cho (P < .001), creatine plus phosphocreatine (P = .02), NAA (P = .02), and mI (P = .008) compared with children with TD. Gray matter Cho transverse relaxation was also prolonged for the ASD sample compared with the TD group (P = .01). The children with ASD demonstrated significantly decreased levels of Cho (P = .04) and mI (P = .008) and trend-level NAA (P = .09) in gray matter compared with the DD group. For white matter, both children with ASD and children with DD showed a similar pattern of NAA and mI level decreases (for children with ASD vs children with TD: NAA, P = .03; mI, P = .04; for children with DD vs children with TD, NAA, P = .03; mI, P = .07). In several analyses, cerebral volume contributed significantly as a covariate. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced gray matter chemical concentrations and altered Cho transverse relaxation, in a pattern distinct from that in children with DD, suggest decreased cellularity, or density, at this early time point in ASD. Possibly reflecting shared developmental features, white matter results were common to ASD and DD groups. The relationship between cerebral volume and neurochemistry at this early time point may indicate processes related to unit scaling."

Based on variable basal cytokeratin immunostaining patterns, we hypothesized that the ""basal phenotype"" tumor group may comprise more than one biological entity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Basal cytokeratins 5 and 14 (CK5/14) were stained by immunohistochemistry and the percentage of positive cells was defined by image analysis. The results thus obtained were compared with clinicopathologic characteristics and relapse-free survival. RESULTS: Of the 506 breast tumors, 53 (10.5%) showed immunoreactivity for CK5/14. Basal cytokeratin expression showed up as two microscopically distinguishable subtypes, i.e., a uniformly positive type (""basal"") and a partially positive type (""basoluminal"") often displaying a checkerboard-type intratumoral heterogeneity. These subgroups could also be separated with a third basal cytokeratin (CK17, P < 0.0001). Both basal and basoluminal subtypes were hormone receptor negative and of high grade, but differed with respect to the Ki-67 labeling index (P = 0.0014), vimentin (P = 0.005), and c-kit (P = 0.02), which were more frequently expressed in basal than in basoluminal tumors. In contrast, the amplification of HER-2 was found almost exclusively in the basoluminal subgroup (P = 0.009). Compared with the basal tumors, basoluminal tumors associated with significantly shorter relapse-free survival (P = 0.01), which was not explained by their more frequent HER-2 amplification. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the intratumoral heterogeneity in basal cytokeratin expression can be used to define two distinct breast cancer subtypes, basal and basoluminal, with distinctive features related to proliferation activity, oncogene and biomarker status, and patient survival."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients (110 lesions) were referred for positive or dubious findings. Three-dimensional fast low-angle shot (3D-FLASH) with contrast injection was applied. EPI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with fat saturation was performed, and ROIs were selected on subtraction 3D-FLASH images before and after contrast injection, and copied on an ADC map. Inter- and intraobserver analyses were performed. RESULTS: At pathology 22 lesions were benign, 65 were malignant, and 23 were excluded. The ADCs of malignant and benign lesions were statistically different. In malignant tumors the ADC was (mean +/- SEM) 0.95 +/- 0.027 x 10(-3)mm(2)/second, and in benign tumors it was 1.51 +/- 0.068 x 10(-3)mm(2)/second. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we found a threshold between malignant and benign lesions for highest sensitivity and specificity (both 86%) around 1.13 +/- 0.10 x 10(-3)mm(2)/second. For a threshold of 0.95 +/- 0.10 x 10(-3)mm(2)/second, specificity was 100% but sensitivity was very low. Inter- and intraobserver studies showed good reproducibility. CONCLUSION: The ADC may help to differentiate benign and malignant lesions with good specificity, and may increase the overall specificity of breast MRI."

Epub 2006 Jun 12.,Carli P,J Am Acad Dermatol,2006,2006/07/18,,,10.1016/j.jaad.2005.12.026,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines for optimized use of digital follow-up of melanocytic lesions are not yet available, and little is known about inclusion criteria adopted in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe the frequency of digital follow-up adoption in melanoma screening, the characteristics of patients and lesions selected, and the predictors of duration of the intervals of digital follow-up. METHODS: Baseline characteristics of patients and lesions selected for digital follow-up in 12 Italian pigmented lesion clinics were examined. Predictors of a short follow-up interval (<or=3 months) compared with a 6-month interval were investigated by means of logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Out of 2116 subjects consecutively examined, 409 were submitted to digital follow-up (19.3%), with 1.6 mean lesions found per patient (range, 1-9; median, 1). According to an a posteriori analysis, 15.2% of the lesions were diagnostically equivocal and 7.8% of lesions had a total dermoscopy score (TDS) suggestive of malignancy. However, large differences in the TDS were found among the participating centers. Determinants of a short follow-up interval, adopted in 40.8% of patients, were the personal history of melanoma (odds ratio [OR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-5.99) and the presence of atypical nevi (at least one atypical nevus (OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.45-8.42). Unexpectedly, the dermoscopic atypia of the lesion (TDS >4.75) was associated only with a marginal effect on the scheduled duration of follow-up interval (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.97-1.86). These findings were confirmed by a multivariate analysis. LIMITATIONS: The adoption of different digital dermoscopy systems in the participating centers may have limited the reliability of the TDS assigned by a central group to dermoscopy images. CONCLUSIONS: Practicing dermatologists who use digital epiluminescence microscopy in screening for melanoma decided to submit at least one melanocytic lesion to digital follow-up for approximately 1 patient for every 5 examined. This implies costs and time spent that need to be evaluated together with the benefits of this procedure from a large-scale perspective. The lack of well-defined guidelines for inclusion and exclusion criteria may hamper optimized use of digital follow-up in daily practice."

STUDY DESIGN: Skin punch biopsies of 9 patients with SLS and 17 healthy volunteers were obtained. Digital images of routine histologic sections were taken, and their gray scale luminance was analyzed by FFT. The inertia values were determined for different ranges of the spatial frequencies in the vertical and horizontal direction. To get an estimation of anisotropy, we calculated the resultant vector of the designated frequency ranges. RESULTS: In the prickle cell layer, SLS patients showed more intense amplitudes in spatial structures with periods between 1.2 and 3.6 microm in the vertical direction, which correlated in part with accentuated nuclei and nucleoli and perinucleolar halos in the H-E sections. In a linear discriminant analysis, the variables derived from the FFT images correctly discriminated 84.6% of the patients. Texture features derived from the gray level cooccurrence matrix were not able to separate the groups. CONCLUSION: Exploratory texture analysis by FFT was able to detect discrete alterations in the prickle cell layer in routine light microscopy slides of SLS patients. The structural changes identified by FFT may be related to abnormal cellular components associated with aberrant lipid metabolism."

Epub 2006 Jul 31.,Baldock C,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2006,2006/08/02,PMC1567674,,10.1073/pnas.0601609103,"Fibrillin-1 is a 330-kDa multidomain extracellular matrix protein that polymerizes to form 57-nm periodic microfibrils, which are essential for all tissue elasticity. Fibrillin-1 is a member of the calcium-binding EGF repeat family and has served as a prototype for structural analyses. Nevertheless, both the detailed structure of fibrillin-1 and its organization within microfibrils are poorly understood because of the complexity of the molecule and the resistance of EGF arrays to crystallization. Here, we have used small-angle x-ray scattering and light scattering to analyze the solution structure of human fibrillin-1 and to produce ab initio structures of overlapping fragments covering 90% of the molecule. Rather than exhibiting a uniform rod shape as current models predict, the scattering data revealed a nonlinear conformation of calcium-binding EGF arrays in solution. This finding has major implications for the structures of the many other EGF-containing extracellular matrix and membrane proteins. The scattering data also highlighted a very compact, globular region of the fibrillin-1 molecule, which contains the integrin and heparan sulfate-binding sites. This finding was confirmed by calculating a 3D reconstruction of this region using electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis. Together, these data have enabled the generation of an improved model for microfibril organization and a previously undescribed mechanism for microfibril extensibility."

It is unknown what causes this heterogeneity of fluorescence in psoriatic skin, despite adequate keratolytic treatment. Variations in fluorescence might explain the variable and the mostly partial clinical response of psoriasis seen after photodynamic therapy (PDT). OBJECTIVES: This study examines morphological and immunohistochemical differences in inhomogeneous PpIX-induced fluorescence in stable plaque psoriasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with stable plaque psoriasis were included in this study. In each patient one psoriatic plaque was incubated with 20% 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) ointment for 3 h after keratolytic treatment. Fluorescence diagnosis with ALA-induced porphyrins (FDAP) was performed and subsequently high- and low-fluorescent psoriatic skin samples were biopsied. Biopsies were investigated with respect to histological hyperkeratosis (thickness of stratum corneum), proliferation (Ki-67 antigen), keratinization (K10, filaggrin) and inflammation (CD3). Digital images acquired with FDAP were analysed using image analysis software. RESULTS: Inhomogeneous fluorescence was seen in 12 of the 14 plaques. A significantly thicker stratum corneum was found in low-fluorescent psoriatic skin compared with highly fluorescent skin. Fluorescence intensity and thickness of the stratum corneum proved to be negatively correlated. The variable-fluorescent parts of the lesional psoriatic skin showed no differences in epidermal proliferation, keratinization or inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous ALA-induced fluorescence in psoriasis plaques related to inhomogeneous distribution of PpIX in the epidermis may result from differences in penetration of ALA and/or light within a plaque caused by differences in stratum corneum thickness. The variable clinical response seen after PDT in psoriasis could be explained by this. These findings are consistent with the general assumption that optimal desquamation prior to FDAP or PDT is required for the most favourable results."
16971600,Magnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways have different blood oxygen level-dependent signal time courses in human primary visual cortex,"Liu CS, Bryan RN, Miki A, Woo JH, Liu GT, Elliott MA.",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 2006 Sep;27(8):1628-34.,Liu CS,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,2006,2006/09/15,PMC8139756,,,"PURPOSE: The magnocellular and parvocellular pathways (M and P pathways) are the major pathways of the visual system, with distinct histologic and physiologic properties that may also have different metabolic characteristics. We hypothesize that the differences of the 2 visual pathways would also manifest as differences in the signal time course of blood oxygen level-dependent functional MR imaging (BOLD fMRI). The differences in BOLD signal time course may provide insight into the metabolic requirements of the 2 pathways. METHODS: Eleven fMRI sessions on 6 subjects were performed using stimuli that preferentially activated the 2 pathways. Regions commonly activated by both the M and P stimuli in the primary visual cortex (V1) were determined, and the contrast elicited by the stimulus, time-to-peak (TTP), and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the BOLD signal time course were measured. RESULTS: The functional stimuli activated cortical regions described previously in the literature, such as V1, V4, and V5. Within V1, the TTP of the signal time course of the 2 stimuli were statistically different, with the P stimulus generating TTPs that were on average 12% faster than the M stimulus (P = .0037). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the ability to functionally differentiate the M and P stimuli in a commonly activated anatomic region. Because the BOLD response is dependent on the ratio of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in the blood, the difference in the BOLD time course between the 2 stimuli suggests that the oxygen demand of the 2 pathways may be different."

Epub 2005 Nov 4.,Chubb C,Neurobiol Aging,2006,2005/11/08,,,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2005.08.023,"We describe a computer application, ""BioVision"", that can be trained to quickly and effectively classify and quantify user definable histological objects (e.g., senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles) within single or double-labeled immunocytochemically stained sections. For a given image population, BioVision is interactively trained (in Independent User Mode) by an investigator to perform the desired classifications. This training yields a statistical model of the different types of objects occurring in the target image population. The resulting model can then be used (in Automated User Mode) to classify all objects in any image or images from the target population. BioVision simplifies the quantification of complex visual objects and improves inter-rater reliability. The program accomplishes classification in two major stages: pixel classification and blob classification. In pixel classification, each pixel is assigned to one of some number of substance classes, based on its chromatic properties and local context, reflecting basic histological distinctions of interest. In the blob classification phase, the image's pixels are first partitioned into ""blobs"": maximal connected sets of pixels assigned to the same substance class. Then, based on its size, shape, textural and contextual properties, each blob is assigned to a histological object class. A Bayesian classifier is used in each of the pixel and blob classification stages. We report several tests of BioVision. First, we applied BioVision to classify senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in several test cases of Alzheimer's brain immunostained for beta-amyloid and PHF-tau and compared the results to those produced by experienced investigators. BioVision was trained to classify Plaque-type blobs as either plaques or plaque-type nonentities, and tangle-type blobs as either tangles or tangle-type nonentities. BioVision classified the objects with an accuracy comparable to the trained investigator. Next, we applied BioVision to the task of counting all the tangles in hippocampal images from 22 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases selected to span a broad range of dementia levels from the tissue repository of UC Irvine's Center for the study of Brain Aging and Dementia. The tangle counts produced by BioVision proved to be significantly better predictors of the cases' adjusted MMSE scores than any of tangle load, age at death, post mortem interval or the interval between the last MMSE score and death."

Ultrasound contrast agents in conjunction with contrast specific imaging techniques are increasingly accepted in clinical use. Up to date there are no data about the use of contrast enhanced sonography (CES) in a large series of pleural based pulmonary lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From August 2004 to August 2005, 137 consecutive patients with pleural based pulmonary lesions on B-mode sonography were studied by CES using a transcapillary second-generation contrast agent (SonoVue(R)). The following CES parameters were retrospectively evaluated. Time to enhancement (TE) of contrast agent after i. v. application was determined and classified as short TE (< = 6 sec) vs. delayed TE (> 6 sec). Extent of enhancement (EE) was evaluated during the arterial phase (2 - 30 sec) and the parenchymal phase (1 - 5 minutes) by using the normal splenic tissue as an in vivo reference, and classified in reduced EE (anechoic/hypoechoic) vs. marked EE (isoechoic/hyperechoic) during both phases. Homogeneity of enhancement (HE) was classified as homogeneous vs. inhomogeneous. 60 patients had histologically confirmed malignant lesions due to central lung cancer (n = 31), and peripheral malignant lesions (n = 29). 77 patients had benign pleural based lesions including pneumonia (n = 32), pulmonary embolism (n = 20), compression atelectasis (17), and other benign pleural based lesions (n = 8). RESULTS: Malignant and benign lesions did not vary significantly regarding TE, EE, and HE. However, there were highly significant differences in the ratio of short vs. delayed TE and reduced vs. marked EE between the six disease groups. Characteristic patterns were short TE with marked EE in all compression atelectasis cases and in 62 % of patients with pneumonia. Delayed TE and reduced EE was seen in all patients with pulmonary embolism and in 62 % of patients with peripheral malignant lesions. Central lung cancer and benign nodules did not present with such specific patterns. No significant differences in HE were seen between subgroups. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary lesions are characterized by different CES-patterns of arterial supply as evidenced by TE and EE which depends on underlying causes, but CES does not allow to distinguish benign from malignant pleural based lesions in general."

The most relevant characteristics of the scanning devices are described, including the cameras used, the speed of digitization, and the image quality. Other aspects, such as the file format, the compression techniques, and the solutions for visualization of digital slides, (including diagnosis-aided tools) are also considered. Most of the systems evaluated allow a high-resolution digitization of the whole slide within about 1 hour using a x40 objective.

For comparative purposes, risk features of our series have been analysed with respect to histopathologic adverse factors. Results were compared with an own historic conventional radiation (3DCRT) series, and with 3DCRT and pIMRT data from other centres.Between January 2002 and August 2006, 71 patients were consecutively treated with pIMRT for a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx (32), oral cavity (22), hypopharynx (7), larynx (6), paranasal sinus (3), and an unknown primary, respectively. Mean and median follow up was 19 months (2-48), and 17.6 months. 83% were treated with IMRT-chemotherapy. Mean prescribed dose was 66.3 Gy (60-70), delivered with doses per fraction of 2-2.3 Gy, respectively. RESULTS: 2-year local, nodal, and distant control rates were 95%, 91%, and 96%, disease free and overall survival 90% and 83%, respectively. The corresponding survival rates for the subgroup of patients with a follow up time >12 months (n = 43) were 98%, 95%, 98%, 93%, and 88%, respectively. Distribution according to histopathologic risk features revealed 15% and 85% patients with intermediate and high risk, respectively. All loco-regional events occurred in the high risk subgroup. CONCLUSION: Surgery followed by postoperative IMRT in patients with substantial risk for recurrence resulted in high loco-regional tumor control rates compared with large prospective 3DCRT trials."

The system has the potential to improve the accuracy of surgical margin assessment in the treatment of breast cancer by providing finer sampling and 3D visualization. A scanning light microscope was modified to allow digital photomicrography of a stack of large (up to 120x170 mm2) histology slides cut serially through the entire specimen. The images are registered and displayed in 2D and 3D. The design of the system, which reduces or eliminates the appearance of 'tiling' and 'seam' artefacts inherent in the scanning method, is described and its resolution, contrast/noise and coverage properties are characterized through measurements of the modulation transfer function (MTF), depth of field (DOF) and signal difference to noise ratio (SDNR). The imaging task requires a lateral resolution of 5 microm, an SDNR of 5 between relevant features, 'tiling artefact' at a level below the detectability threshold of the eye, and 'seam artefact' of less than 5-10 microm. The tests demonstrate that the system is largely adequate for the imaging task, although further optimizations are required to reduce the degradation of coverage incurred by seam artefact."

A good qualitative agreement of the model's predictions with clinical experience supports the applicability of the approach to chemotherapy optimization."

Our results show that dermal collagen and elastic fibers display different susceptibility to thermal injury. Morphologically, dermal collagen starts to denature at 60 degrees C while fracture and aggregation of elastic fibers do not occur until 65 degrees C. With increasing temperatures, the structures of both elastic and collagen fibers deteriorate. While second-harmonic-generation (SHG) imaging is helpful in identifying the denaturation temperature of collagen, autofluorescence (AF) imaging can help to identify the structural alternations of tissue at higher temperatures when SHG signals have decayed. We also employ a ratiometric approach based on the AF-to-SHG index of dermis (ASID) to characterize the degree of dermal thermal damage. Use of the ASID index can bypass the difficulty in analyzing inhomogeneous dermal fibers and show that dermal collagen starts to denature at 60 degrees C. Our results suggest that with additional developments, multiphoton microscopy has potential to be developed into an effective in vivo imaging technique to monitor and characterize dermal thermal damage."

The identity of each cell in the investigated population is secured, even during bio-manipulation, by cell retention in a specially designed concave microlens, acting as a picoliter well (PW). The MCR technique combines micro-optical features and microtiter plate methodology. The array of PWs serves as the bottom of a microtiter plate, fitted with a unique flow damper element. The latter enables rapid fluid exchange without dislodging the cells from their original PWs, thus maintaining the cells' identity. Loading cell suspensions and reagents into the MCR is performed by simple pouring, followed by gravitational sedimentation and settling of cells into the PWs. Cell viability and cell division within the MCR were shown to be similar to those obtained under similar conditions in a standard microtiter plate. The efficiency of single cell occupancy in the MCR exceeded 90%. No cell dislodging was observed when comparing images before and after bio-manipulations (rinsing, staining, etc.). The MCR permits the performance of kinetic measurements on an individual cell basis. Data acquisition is governed by software, controlling microscope performance, stage position and image acquisition and analysis. The PW's unique micro-optical features enable rapid, simultaneous signal analysis of each individual cell, bypassing lengthy image analysis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was done in patients with bladder outlet obstruction undergoing transurethral prostate resection. Patients were divided into 33 with obstruction and 14 in acute urinary retention. A total of 15 males without obstruction undergoing transurethral prostate resection for bladder tumor formed the control group. Detrusor specimens were obtained during transurethral prostate resection. Detrusor muscle cell diameter was measured using light microscopy and a semiautomatic image analysis system. The connective tissue-to-smooth muscle ratio was automatically determined with computer assisted image analysis. Symptoms and urodynamic assessment were performed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included. The obstruction and acute urinary retention groups had a statistically higher detrusor muscle cell diameter and more fibrosis than the control group. Patients in acute urinary retention had more intrafascicular fibrosis (higher connective tissue-to-smooth muscle ratio at 40x magnification) than patients with obstruction. There were no differences in detrusor muscle cell diameter or interfascicular fibrosis (connective tissue-to-smooth muscle ratio at 10x magnification) between the obstruction and acute urinary retention groups. Detrusor muscle cell diameter correlated with symptom duration and functional recovery after transurethral prostate resection. Detrusor fibrosis correlated with preoperative detrusor pressure at maximum flow and postoperative compliance. Patients in acute urinary retention had fewer symptoms and higher residual volume. Other urodynamic parameters and their improvement after surgery were similar in the acute urinary retention and obstruction groups. CONCLUSIONS: Morphometric differences in detrusor muscle cell diameter and the connective tissue-to-smooth muscle ratio were observed between controls and patients with obstruction. There is an increase in detrusor muscle cell diameter and fibrosis in bladder outlet obstruction and more intense intrafascicular collagen deposition in patients in acute urinary retention."

METHODS: Buttons of keratoconic corneas derived from penetrating keratoplasty were sent for structural analysis with a custom-built multiphoton microscope. Fluorescence detected within the cytoplasm and the SHG signal obtained from collagen were used to demonstrate the morphologic changes in the corneal specimens. RESULTS: The fluorescent epithelial cells around the apical area were elongated and were aligned parallel to the adjacent collagen fibers. Parallel and centripetal distribution patterns of stromal collagen bundles were demonstrated at different depths within the keratoconic corneas. CONCLUSIONS: MF and SHG microscopy provides three-dimensional structural analysis of keratoconus ex vivo. It may provide important morphologic information for the investigation of the pathogenesis of keratoconus and may have potential in a clinical setting as an in vivo diagnostic and monitoring system for advancing keratoconus.

All the different procedures should provide in an objective and reproducible fashion quantitative measurements of the colour and shape features of a given skin mole. At present, many devices have been introduced in experimental stages for clinical diagnosis, mainly used to provide to the clinicians an objective, computer-assisted second opinion. As for any diagnostic instruments, optical devices should also be subjected to a dedicated quality assurance protocol in order to evaluate the response repeatability of each device (intra-instrument agreement) and to check the accordance among the responses of different devices (inter-instrument agreement). The aim of this study was to design a quality assurance protocol for optical devices dedicated to image analysis of pigmented skin lesions and, in case, to detect cutaneous melanoma by using suitable tissue-like phantoms as standard references that enable testing of both hardware and software components. As an example, we report the results of intra-instrument and inter-instrument agreement when the protocol was applied on a series of 30 SpectroShade instruments, a novel optical device based on multi-spectral image analysis of colour and shape features of pigmented skin lesion."

In the present study, we measured basic ultrasonic characteristics of atherosclerosis by two-dimensional (2D) intravascular tissue velocity imaging. Radio-frequency (RF) signal from a clinically used IVUS apparatus was digitized at 500 MSa/s and stored in a workstation. First, the correlation coefficient between two consecutive frames was calculated in the rotational direction and the rotational disuniformity was corrected to obtain the maximum correlation coefficient. Then, the polar coordinate images were converted into rectangular coordinate images and the images were divided into 64 by 64 square shaped regions of interest (ROIs). The correlation and displacement of the ROIs between the consecutive two frames were calculated by template matching method. Two-dimensional tissue velocity was defined as the vectors of displacement of ROI with 0.7 and more correlation. IVUS studies were performed in directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) procedures. The specimens excised by DCA were stained with Elastica-Masson's trichrome staining and CD68 immunochemical staining. Eleven cases (including two no re-flow cases and one perforation case) were intraoperatively observed by IVUS and the specimens obtained by DCA were observed by optical microscopy. The specimen from homogeneous 2D strain was collagen dominant fibrosis and the specimen from a lesion with complex vectors contained CD68 positive cells and degenerated collagen fibers, which indicated the plaque was vulnerable."

Epub 2006 Jan 18.,Atwood RC,Dent Mater,2007,2006/01/25,,,10.1016/j.dental.2005.12.001,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to apply computational modeling tools to assist in the design of titanium dental castings. The tools developed should incorporate state-of-the-art micromodels to predict the depth to which the mechanical properties of the crown are affected by contamination from the mold. The model should also be validated by comparison of macro- and micro-defects found in a typical investment cast titanium tooth crown. METHODS: Crowns were hand-waxed and investment cast in commercial purity grade 1 (CP-1) titanium by a commercial dental laboratory. The castings were analyzed using X-ray microtomography (XMT). Following sectioning, analysis continued with optical and scanning electron microscopy, and microhardness testing. An in-house cellular-automata solidification and finite-difference diffusion program was coupled with a commercial casting program to model the investment casting process. A three-dimensional (3D) digital image generated by X-ray tomography was used to generate an accurate geometric representation of a molar crown casting. Previously reported work was significantly expanded upon by including transport of dissolved oxygen and impurity sources upon the arbitrarily shaped surface of the crown, and improved coupling of micro- and macro-scale simulations. RESULTS: Macroscale modeling was found to be sufficient to accurately predict the location of the large internal porosity. These are shrinkage pores located in the thick sections of the cusp. The model was used to determine the influence of sprue design on the size and location of these pores. Combining microscale with macroscale modeling allowed the microstructure and depth of contamination to be predicted qualitatively. This combined model predicted a surprising result--the dissolution of silicon from the mold into the molten titanium is sufficient to depress the freezing point of the liquid metal such that the crown solidifies the subsurface. Solidification then progresses inwards and back out to the surface through the silicon-enriched near-surface layer. The microstructure and compositional analysis of the near-surface region are consistent with this prediction. SIGNIFICANCE: A multiscale model was developed and validated, which can be used to design CP-Ti dental castings to minimize both macro- and micro-defects, including shrinkage porosity, grain size and the extent of surface contamination due to reaction with the mold material. The model predicted the surprising result that the extent of Si contamination from the mold was sufficient to suppress the liquidus temperature to the extent that the surface (to a depth of approximately 100 microm) of the casting solidifies after the bulk. This significantly increases the oxygen pickup, thereby increasing the depth of formation of alpha casing. The trend towards mold materials with reduced Si in order to produce easier-to-finish titanium castings is a correct approach."

Yet, this technique requires highly trained staff, is labour intensive and has limited statistical reliability. A recent development in this field was the introduction of automated peripheral blood differential counting systems. These computerised systems provide an automated morphological analysis of peripheral blood films, including a preclassification of both red and white cells (RBCs and WBCs, respectively). AIMS: To investigate the ability of two automated microscopy systems to examine peripheral blood smears. METHODS: Two automated microscopy systems, the Cellavision Diffmaster Octavia (Octavia) and Cellavision DM96 (DM96), were evaluated. RESULTS: The overall preclassification accuracy values for the Octavia and the DM96 systems were 87% and 92%, respectively. Evaluation of accuracy (WBC analysis) showed good correlation for both automated systems when compared with manual differentiation. Total analysis time (including post classification) was 5.4 min/slide for the Octavia and 3.2 min/slide for the DM96 (100 WBC/slide) system. The DM96 required even less time than manual differentiation by an experienced biomedical scientist. CONCLUSIONS: The Octavia and the DM96 are automated cell analysis systems capable of morphological classification of RBCs and WBCs in peripheral blood smears. Classification accuracy depends on the type of pathological changes in the blood sample. Both systems operate most effectively in the analysis of non-pathological blood samples."

Diffusion of (3)He in each airway is anisotropic and can be described by distinct longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients. This macroscopically isotropic but microscopically anisotropic model allows estimation of these diffusion coefficients from multi b-value MR experiments despite the airways being too small to be resolved by direct imaging. Herein a Bayesian approach is used for analyzing the uncertainties in the model parameter estimates. The approach allows evaluation of relative errors of the parameter estimates as functions of the ""true"" values of the parameters, the signal-to-noise ratio, the maximum b-value and the total number of b-values used in the experiment. For a given set of the ""true"" diffusion parameters, the uncertainty in the estimated diffusion coefficients has a minimum as a function of maximum b-value and total number of data points. Choosing the MR pulse sequence parameters corresponding to this minimum optimizes the diffusion MR experiment and gives the best possible estimates of the diffusion coefficients. The mathematical approach presented can be generalized for models containing arbitrary numbers of estimated parameters."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images were obtained with conventional US and tissue harmonic imaging in 88 patients (age range, 25-67 years; mean age, 45 years) with 91 solid breast masses (30 cancers and 61 benign lesions) before excisional or needle biopsy. Three experienced radiologists, who did not perform the examinations, independently analyzed the US findings and provided a level of suspicion to indicate the probability of malignancy. Results were evaluated by using kappa statistics and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. RESULTS: Regarding the descriptions of US findings, echogenicity (kappa=0.205) was the most discordant between conventional US and tissue harmonic imaging, followed by margin (kappa=0.495), lesion boundary (kappa=0.495), calcifications (kappa=0.537), posterior acoustic transmission (kappa=0.546), echotexture (kappa=0.586), shape (kappa=0.591), and orientation (kappa=0.594). The area under the ROC curve (Az) for conventional US and tissue harmonic imaging was 0.84 and 0.79, respectively, for reader 1; 0.88 and 0.85, respectively, for reader 2; and 0.91 and 0.89, respectively, for reader 3. The overall Az value for the three readers was 0.88 for conventional US and 0.84 for tissue harmonic imaging (95% confidence interval: -0.0950, 0.1646; P=.595).

We evaluate the preoperative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of benign and malignant salivary gland tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution MR imaging was performed on 31 patients with benign or malignant salivary gland tumors; ADC maps of the tumors were also obtained. Surface coils of 47 or 110 mm diameter were used to improve the image resolution. The ADCs were compared with histologic features of the excised tumors. RESULTS: The ADC maps effectively depicted the histologic features of the salivary gland tumors, such as presence of cancer cells, myxomatous tissues, fibrosis, necrosis, cyst formation, and lymphoid tissues. The ADC maps showed that more frequent areas with high ADCs (> or = 1.8 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) were significantly greater in benign tumors than in malignant tumors. The sensitivity and specificity for high ADC occupying fewer than 5% of the area of a tumor was 89% and 100%, respectively, resulting in 97% accuracy, 100% positive predictive value, and 96% negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: The ADC may provide preoperative tissue characterization of the salivary gland tumors."

Complexities arise as a result of variation in spatial nonuniformity, shape, overlapping compartments and scale (size). A new technique and methodology has been developed and tested for delineating subcellular morphology and partitioning overlapping compartments at multiple scales. This system is packaged as an integrated software platform for quantifying images that are obtained through fluorescence microscopy. Proposed methods are model based, leveraging geometric shape properties of subcellular compartments and corresponding protein localization. From the morphological perspective, convexity constraint is imposed to delineate and partition nuclear compartments. From the protein localization perspective, radial symmetry is imposed to localize punctate protein events at submicron resolution. Convexity constraint is imposed against boundary information, which are extracted through a combination of zero-crossing and gradient operator. If the convexity constraint fails for the boundary then positive curvature maxima are localized along the contour and the entire blob is partitioned into disjointed convex objects representing individual nuclear compartment, by enforcing geometric constraints. Nuclear compartments provide the context for protein localization, which may be diffuse or punctate. Punctate signal are localized through iterative voting and radial symmetries for improved reliability and robustness. The technique has been tested against 196 images that were generated to study centrosome abnormalities. Corresponding computed representations are compared against manual counts for validation."

The first method applies statistical geometrical features to detect image regions that contain epithelial cells and hide those regions with medium and contamination. Sequential forward floating selection was used to identify the most representative features. A shape of cells was identified by applying an active contour model supported by some postprocessing techniques. The second method applies edge detection, ridge following, contour grouping, and Fisher linear discriminant to detect abnormal nuclei. Evaluation of the algorithms' performance and comparison with alternative approaches show that both methods are reliable and, when combined, improve the classification. By presenting only images or their parts that are diagnostically important, the method unburdens a physician from massive and messy data. It also indicates abnormalities marking atypical nuclei and, in that sense, supports diagnosis of cervical cancer."

The clinicopathological data comprised: patients' age, gender, survival, tumour site and stage, tumour histology and MYCN status.The morphological analysis of the angiogenic potential concentrated on examination of vascular patterns - classical type or pathological angiogenesis with mural microvascular proliferation (MVP). The quantitative study included semi-automatic assessment of vascular density (VD) in CD34 stained tumour sections. Pathologic angiogenesis with MVP, including simple and/or glomeruloid type, was encountered in 25 cases and was more frequent in differentiating histology subtype and extraadrenal tumours. VD value ranged from 56 to 385 vessels/mm2 (median 149). Higher VD was connected with younger patient's age. In untreated tumours VD was significantly higher in infants than in children over one year of age. Pathologic type angiogenesis and lower VD were found to be associated with shorter survival. Our study confirmed high vascularization of NB and revealed common occurrence of vascular pattern with MVP. Angiogenic potential in the analysed group showed diversity related to some clinicopathological tumour features. This points toward heterogeneity of NB tumours in vascular aspects, possibly affecting tumours' reactivity to antiangiogenic therapy."

We assessed the hypothesis that a semi-automated quantification program (AUTO) for CMR would be faster and more accurate than MANU without loss of reliability. In the analysis of carotid atherosclerosis in asymptomatic hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 17), AUTO was superior to MANU in speed and histopathologic correlation without significant differences in inter-and intra-observer variability. Implementation of AUTO may facilitate CMR for the screening of the burden of atherosclerotic disease."

Titanium grade 5 disks were machined in preparation for acid etching. Tests were carried out using different acids and combinations of them with varying time exposures. All etched surfaces were scanned with an electron microscope, and digital images were created for visual evaluation and description of the surfaces. The etched surfaces were evaluated for surface morphology (combination of microroughness and waviness); the surface most like the sandblasted/acid-etched surface was best obtained with a combination of sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. The etched titanium disks were fixed in acrylic resin (2 were cut and polished and 2 were scored and fractured) and the surface profile was examined. In the second part of the investigation, 28 screw-shaped implants that were manufactured from commercially available titanium grade 5 were selected and divided into 2 groups: 3 implants were used as controls (machined surface), and 25 implants were processed using the preferred etching method determined in the first part of the investigation. Magnifications of 27, 200, and 2000 were used to analyze the first 2 consecutive crests of threads, flanks, and root of threads of each implant with the treated surface. A 3-dimensional optical interferometer was used to characterize the surface roughness of both control and test groups. Three screws were selected from each group and measured at 9 sites: 3 measurements each on the crest, root, and flank of the threads. To describe the surface roughness in numbers, the following parameters were used: the average height deviation (Sa), the developed interfacial area ratio (Sdr), the fastest decay autocorrelation length (Sal), and the density of summits (Sds). In addition, in a third experiment, the surfaces of 5 commercially available screw-type implants and the experimental ones were analyzed and compared. It was concluded that the new experimental acid-etched titanium surface had the features of a roughened titanium surface, with glossily microroughness and large waviness. In general, the experimental surface was significantly rougher than the selected commercially available implants and similar to a sandblasted/acid-etched surface (top Sa: 2.08 +/- 0.36 microm, Sdr: 1.34 +/- 0.3 microm, valleys: 1.16 +/- 0.1 microm and 0.68 +/- 0.1 microm, flanks: 2.24 +/- 0.8 microm and 1.27 +/- 0.1 microm, respectively)."

The occurrence, characteristics and significance of angiogenesis in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma are less well known. METHODS: In this study, vessel number as well as vessel size, vessel shape and vessel antibody staining intensity were determined in 23,091 vessels in CD34-stained histological specimens of 42 patients by computer-assisted quantitative image analysis methods and findings were related to tumor morphology, clinical characteristics and patient survival. RESULTS: The 2- and 5-year survival rates were 81.1 and 64.1%, respectively. High disease stage and high histological grade indicated poor prognosis. In an age-adjusted multivariate analysis of stage, grade and extent of invasion, these variables compiled a statistically significant prognostic factor (p=0.001). Tumor histopathological type was a prognostic factor in our study and keratinising tumors did significantly better. Large tumor size, but not depth of invasion, and spray type growth pattern also indicated poor survival. In an age-adjusted multivariate analysis of stage, grade and extent of invasion, these variables compiled a statistically significant prognostic factor (p=0.001), but none of these variables alone proved to be an independent prognostic factor. High vessel number and increased vessel size were also significant indicators of poor survival, as were vessel characteristics: vessel number, vessel size, vessel shape and staining intensity together. CONCLUSION: Increased angiogenesis and altered vessel characteristics were prognostic factors in determining patient survival in this study. Analysis of angiogenesis provided new information on tumor behaviour and provided markers for survival analysis in neoplasms classified by tumor type and growth pattern."

Investigators now appreciate the need to gauge pathological changes and their response to treatment by quantifying susceptible structural parameters. But the desired information respecting three-dimensional structures must be gleaned from either actual or virtual two-dimensional sections through the tissue. This information can be obtained only if the laws governing stereology are respected. In this chapter, the stereological principles that must be applied, and the practical methods that have been devised, to yield unbiased estimates of the most commonly determined structural parameters, namely, volume, surface area and number, are summarized."

This paper introduces an image segmentation method for the automated identification of Squamous epithelium from such virtual slides. In order to produce the best segmentation results, in addition to saving processing time and memory, a multiresolution segmentation strategy was developed. The Squamous epithelium layer is first segmented at a low resolution (2X magnification). The boundaries of segmented Squamous epithelium are further fine tuned at the highest resolution of 40X magnification, using an iterative boundary expanding-shrinking method. The block-based segmentation method uses robust texture feature vectors in combination with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform classification. Medical histology rules are finally applied to remove misclassifications. Results demonstrate that, with typical virtual slides, classification accuracies of between 94.9% and 96.3% are achieved."

Reliable diagnostic of the different plaque types are of great interest for the medical community the predicting their evolution and applying an effective treatment. To achieve this, a tissue classification must be performed. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) represents a technique to explore the vessel walls and to observe its histological properties. In this paper, a method to reconstruct IVUS images from the raw Radio Frequency (RF) data coming from ultrasound catheter is proposed. This framework offers a normalization scheme to compare accurately different patient studies. The automatic tissue classification is based on texture analysis and Adapting Boosting (Adaboost) learning technique combined with Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC). In this study, 9 in-vivo cases are reconstructed with 7 different parameter set. This method improves the classification rate based on images, yielding a 91% of well-detected tissue using the best parameter set. It also reduces the inter-patient variability compared with the analysis of DICOM images, which are obtained from the commercial equipment."

The degree of steatosis is a useful marker of steatohepatitis. This degree is routinely assessed visually by an expert and then lacks of accuracy and robustness. The process that we have developed is divided in two steps. A fuzzy classification first merges into classes pixels according to their intensity. We use a generalized objective function that allows to detect micro and blurredness vacuoles of steatosis. Then, regions with inhomogeneous texture and irregular shape were eliminated with compactness and standard deviation parameters. The obtained results are good correlated with expert graduation (in five levels). A better correlation is obtained with a more precise grading."

For cervix carcinoma the prognosis is better for compact shapes than for diffusive shapes since the latter may already indicate invasion, the stage in tumor progression that precedes the formation of metastases. In this paper, we present methods for describing and evaluating tumor objects and their surfaces based on topological and geometric properties. For geometry, statistics of the binary object's distance transform are used to evaluate the tumor's invasion front. In addition, a simple compactness measure is adapted to 3D images and presented to compare different types of tumor samples. As a topological measure, the Betti numbers are calculated of voxelized tumor objects based on a medial axis transform. We further illustrate how these geometric and topological properties can be used for a quantitative comparison of histological material and single-cell-based tumor growth simulations."

The method comprises three stages: (1) color normalization to reduce the quality variation of tissue image within samples from individual subjects or from different subjects; (2) automatic sampling from tissue image to eliminate tedious and time-consuming steps; and (3) principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize color features in accordance with a standard set of training data. We evaluate the algorithm by comparing the performance of the proposed fully-automated method against semi-automated procedures. Experimental studies show consist agreement between the two methods. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides an effective tool for evaluating oral cancer images. It can also be applied to other microscopic images prepared with the same type of tissue staining."

The main contributor to this problem is believed to be deformation of the ear and ear canal caused by movement of the mandible. Physical discomfort results from added pressure on soft tissue areas in the ear. Identifying features that can predict potential deformation is therefore important for identifying problematic cases in advance. A study on the physical deformation of the human ear and canal due to movement of the mandible is presented. The study is based on laser scannings of 30 pairs of ear impressions from 9 female and 21 male subjects. Two impressions have been taken from each subject, one with open mouth, and one with the mouth closed. All impressions are registered using non-rigid surface registration and a shape model is built. From each pair of impressions a deformation field is generated and propagated to the shape model, enabling the building of a deformation model in the reference frame of the shape model. A relationship between the two models is established, showing that the shape variation can explain approximately 50% of the variation in the deformation model. An hypothesis test for significance of the deformations for each deformation field reveals that all subjects have significant deformation at Tragus and in the canal. Furthermore, a relation between the magnitude of the deformation and the gender of the subject is demonstrated. The results are successfully validated by comparing the outcome to the anatomy by using a single set of high resolution histological sectionings of the region of interest."

More than 100,000 digitized samples (1200 x 1200 pixels) have already been processed on the Grid. We have analyzed results for 3744 breast tissue samples, which were originated from four different institutions using diaminobenzidine (DAB) and hematoxylin staining. Both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction techniques are compared, and the best one (ISOMAP) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the features. The experimental results show that the Gentle Boosting using an eight node CART decision tree as the weak learner provides the best result for classification. The algorithm has an accuracy of 86.02% using only 20% of the specimens as the training set."

METHODS: Our database consisted of current and previous magnification mammograms obtained from 93 patients before and after three-month follow-up examination. It included 11 invasive carcinomas, 19 noninvasive carcinomas of the comedo type, 25 non-invasive carcinomas of the noncomedo type, 23 mastopathies, and 15 fibroadenomas. Six objective features on clustered microcalcifications were first extracted from each of the current and the previous images. The nearest neighbor case was then identified by the Euclidean distance in the previous and current feature-space. The histological classification of an unknown new case in question was assumed to be the same as that of the nearest neighbor case which has the shortest Euclidean distance in our database. RESULTS: The classification accuracies were 90.9% for invasive carcinoma, 89.5% for noninvasive carcinoma of the comedo type, 96.0% for noninvasive carcinoma of the noncomedo type, 82.6% for mastopathy, and 93.3% for fibroadenoma. These results were substantially higher than those with our previous CAD scheme. CONCLUSION: The nearest neighbor criterion was useful in a CAD scheme for determining the histological classification."

The present paper shows how computed protonation properties provide unique and powerful capabilities for the prediction of catalytic sites from the 3D structure alone. These protonation properties of the ionizable residues in a protein may be computed from the 3D structure using the calculated electrical potential function. In particular, the shapes of the theoretical microscopic titration curves (THEMATICS) enable selection of the residues involved in catalysis or small molecule recognition with good sensitivity and precision. Results are shown for 169 annotated enzymes in the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA). Performance, as measured by residue recall and precision, is clearly better than that of other 3D-structure-based methods. When compared with methods based on sequence alignments and structural comparisons, THEMATICS performance is competitive for well-characterized enzymes. However THEMATICS performance does not degrade in the absence of similarity, as do the alignment-based methods, even if there are few or no sequence homologues or few or no proteins of similar structure. It is further shown that the protonation properties perform well on open, unbound structures, even if there is substantial conformational change upon ligand binding."

This system is an essential step towards the future development of a computer-aided diagnosis tool and the statistical validation of biological hypotheses about Cx43 expressions and configurations during tumorogenesis. The proposed system contains two dependent part: a segmentation part in which the cell structures of interest are automatically located on images and a characterization part in which some spatial features are computed for the classification of cells. Using immunofluorescent images of cells, the nucleus, cytoplasm and proteins structures within the cell are extracted. Then, some spatial features are computed to characterize spatial configurations of the proteins with regard to the nucleus and cytoplasm areas in the image. Last, the 3D cell images are classified into pathogenic or viable classes. The system has been quantitatively evaluated over 60 cell images acquired by a deconvolution high-resolution microscope and whose ground truth has been manually given by a biologist expert. As a perspective, a 3D spatial reasoning and visualization module is currently under development."

An intense remodelling of the varicose vein wall has been described and could be at the origin of its weakness and altered elasticity. We have described previously a dysregulation of collagen synthesis in cultured smooth muscle cells from saphenous veins and in dermal fibroblasts from the skin of patients with varicose veins, suggesting a systemic defect in their connective tissue. The present study describes comparative morphological and immunohistochemical data in both the skin and saphenous veins of eight control subjects (undergoing coronary bypass surgery) and eight patients with varicose veins. Histological staining of glycoproteins, the elastic fibre network and collagen bundles showed that the remodelling and fragmentation of elastic fibres observed in varicose veins were also present in the skin of the patients. When compared with control subjects, we observed in both the veins and skin of patients with varicose veins (i) an increase in the elastic network, as quantified by image analysis; (ii) an accumulation of collagen type I, fibrillin-1 and laminin; and (iii) an overproduction of MMP (matrix metalloproteinase)-1, MMP-2 and MMP-3, analysed by immunohistochemistry, but normal levels of other MMPs (MMP-7 and MMP-9) and their inhibitors (TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3). An imbalance of extracellular matrix production/degradation was thus observed in veins as well as in the skin of the patients with varicose veins and, taken together, these findings show that remodelling is present in different organs, confirming systemic alterations of connective tissues."

In this way, MRSI can be used to detect tissue regions with abnormal metabolism, e.g. tumor tissue. The main drawback of MRSI in clinical practice is that the analysis of the data requires a lot of expertise from the radiologists. In this article, we present an automatic method that assigns each voxel of a spectroscopic image of the brain to a histopathological class. The method is based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which has recently been shown to be a robust technique for tissue typing. In CCA, the spectral as well as the spatial information about the voxel is used to assign it to a class. This has advantages over other methods that only use spectral information since histopathological classes are normally covering neighbouring voxels. In this paper, a new CCA-based method is introduced in which MRSI and MR imaging information is integrated. The performance of tissue typing is compared for CCA applied to the whole MR spectra and to sets of features obtained from the spectra. Tests on simulated and in vivo MRSI data show that the new method is very accurate in terms of classification and segmentation. The results also show the advantage of combining spectroscopic and imaging data."

Demonstration of the t(X;18) by cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction has become the gold standard for diagnosis, but practical considerations limit the availability of these methods. Gene expression profiling studies performed by several independent groups have consistently identified TLE1 as an excellent discriminator of synovial sarcoma from other sarcomas, including histologically similar tumors such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. TLE proteins (human homologues of Groucho) are transcriptional corepressors that inhibit Wnt signaling and other cell fate determination signals, and so have an established role in repressing differentiation. We examined the expression of TLE proteins in synovial sarcoma and in a broad range of mesenchymal tumors using tissue microarrays to assess the value of anti-TLE antibodies in the immunohistochemical confirmation of synovial sarcoma. We demonstrate that TLE expression is a consistent feature of synovial sarcoma using both a well-characterized monoclonal antibody recognizing the TLE family of proteins and a commercially available polyclonal antibody raised against TLE1. Both antibodies gave intense and/or diffuse nuclear staining in 91/94 molecularly confirmed synovial sarcomas. Moderate staining is occasionally seen in schwannoma and solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma. In contrast, TLE staining is detected much less frequently and at lower levels, if at all, in 40 other mesenchymal tumors. Our findings establish TLE as a robust immunohistochemical marker for synovial sarcoma, and may have implications for understanding the biology of synovial sarcoma and for developing experimental therapies for this cancer."

Our results confirm that malignant lymph nodes are round in shape (p < 0.001) and show peripheral perfusion (p = 0.0089). Dynamic parameters revealed that malignant nodes were characterized by contrast medium wash-in time (p = 0.0487). However, the contrast-related criteria did not improve the pretherapeutic prediction of malignancy. Although contrast medium kinetics provided statistically significant new criteria for identifying malignant lymph nodes, differentiating between malignant and inflammatory changes in lymph nodes remains a diagnostic challenge."

In cerebral neoplasm, DTT can be used to illustrate the relationship of the tumor with respect to adjacent WM trajectories. METHODS: Fiber tractography was used in this study to assess tumor-induced changes in WM trajectories in three cases of cerebral neoplasm: glioblastoma multiforme, meningioma, and anaplastic astrocytoma. RESULTS: Three patterns of WM alteration were identified: 1) disruption, 2) displacement, and 3) infiltration. Tumor disruption of WM tracts was observed in glioblastoma multiforme, which terminated fibers crossing the corpus callosum. In meningioma, DTT illustrated bulk displacement of the corticospinal tract in the affected hemisphere as well as preservation of the deviated axons. In anaplastic astrocytoma, fiber tracking demonstrated disruption of WM tracts at the tumor origin as well as intact axons through areas of tumor infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Fiber tracking results correlated with the clinical and histopathological features of the tumor. Larger case series will be required to determine if fiber tracking can add accuracy to existing imaging methods for grading tumors."

In this paper, the corneal endothelium is represented as a binary image composed of the cell inscribed circles. The granulometric distribution function of the complement of this image is used as a functional descriptor, which provides information about the shape, size and spatial arrangement of cells. Experimental evaluation using bootstrap techniques shows its ability to discriminate between controls and pathological cases. It represents a reliable and graphical alternative to the classical indices (cell density, hexagonality and coefficient of variation of cell areas), which behave poorly when detecting subtle abnormalities."

Epub 2007 Jan 8.,Yovel Y,Neuroimage,2007,2007/01/09,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.055,"Individual mapping of cerebral, morphological, functionally related structures using MRI was carried out using a new multi-contrast acquisition and analysis framework, called virtual-dot-com imaging. So far, conventional anatomical MRI has been able to provide gross segmentation of gray/white matter boundaries and a few sub-cortical structures. By combining a handful of imaging contrasts mechanisms (T1, T2, magnetization transfer, T2* and proton density), we were able to further segment sub-cortical tissue to its sub-nuclei arrangement, a segmentation that is difficult based on conventional, single-contrast MRI. Using an automatic four-step image and signal processing algorithm, we segmented the thalamus to at least 7 sub-nuclei with high similarity across subjects and high statistical significance within subjects (p<0.0001). The identified sub-nuclei resembled the known anatomical arrangement of the thalamus given in various atlases. Each cluster was characterized by a unique MRI contrast fingerprint. With this procedure, the weighted proportions of the different cellular compartments could be estimated, a property available to date only by histological analysis. Each sub-nucleus could be characterized in terms of normalized MRI contrast and compared to other sub-nuclei. The different weights of the contrasts (T1/T2/T2*/PD/MT, etc.) for each sub-nuclei cluster might indicate the intra-cluster morphological arrangement of the tissue that it represents. The implications of this methodology are far-ranging, from non-invasive, in vivo, individual mapping of histologically distinct brain areas to automatic identification of pathological processes."

Here, we investigated a novel approach for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis using sonography-based real-time elastography, which can be performed with conventional ultrasound probes during a routine sonography examination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time elastography was performed in 79 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and known fibrosis stage and in 20 healthy volunteers. A specially developed program was used for quantification of tissue elasticity. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to define an elasticity score using variables with high reproducibility in a preceding analysis of data from 16 different patients. In addition, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and routine laboratory values were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The Spearman's correlation coefficient between the elasticity scores obtained using real-time elastography and the histologic fibrosis stage was 0.48, which is highly significant (p < 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy expressed as areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.75 for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (fibrosis stage according to METAVIR scoring system [F] > or = F2), 0.73 for severe fibrosis (F > or = F3), and 0.69 for cirrhosis. For a combined elasticity-laboratory score, the areas under the ROC curves were 0.93, 0.95, and 0.91, respectively. DISCUSSION: Real-time elastography is a new and promising sonography-based noninvasive method for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis."

Our results show that multiphoton microscopy is effective for identifying structural alterations due to corneal infections without the need of histological processing. With additional developments, multiphoton microscopy has the potential to be developed into an imaging technique effective in the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of corneal infections."

While both age and intraocular pressure (IOP) are well-recognized risk factors for this disease, the underlying pathologic process involves the accelerated death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that is associated with progressive loss of vision. The loss of RGCs has been postulated to occur primarily by injury to axons in the optic nerve head (ONH) due to its anatomic features and the mechanical vulnerability of the lamina cribrosa, the specialized ONH zone comprised of collagen beams that define the channels or pores through which axon bundles exit the eye. Recent advances in multiphoton microscopy using femtosecond lasers that generate second harmonic (SH) signals from collagen allows for direct optical imaging of the lamina cribrosa. We assess the application of SH generated microscopy (SHG) to the study of the ONH, and test the general hypothesis that increasing intraocular pressure in the same eye results in the movement of ONH collagen beams leading to distortion of the lamina cribrosa channels and compression of the axon bundles."

Epub 2006 Nov 22.,Chappard D,Osteoporos Int,2007,2006/11/23,,,10.1007/s00198-006-0278-8,"SUMMARY: Microarchitectural changes in trabecular bone were analyzed by microcomputed tomography (microCT) and histomorphometry in 24 patients with corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. The microCT images revealed a reduction in trabecular thickness only on frequency distribution curves, with no increase in trabecular separation. Trabecular plate thinning and perforations were easily identified. INTRODUCTION: Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis (CSIOP) is mediated by direct actions of the drug on bone cells. The result is a decrease in trabecular bone mass and a reduction in trabecular thickness, but connectivity is believed to remain rather well preserved. METHODS: Twenty-four transiliac bone biopsies from patients with CSIOP were studied conjointly by histomorphometry [with two-dimensional (2D) architectural descriptors] and microCT (with 3D analysis of trabecular characteristics, including trabecular thickness and separation). The frequency distribution of thickness and separation were compared with data obtained in nine control subjects. RESULTS: 2D histomorphometry revealed a decrease in bone volume and trabecular thickness in the bone biopsies of the CSIOP patients when compared to those of the controls. MicroCT appeared to be able to identify the reduction in thickness only when the frequency distribution of trabecular thickness was computed. No difference for the curves of the frequency distribution of trabecular separation was evidenced between patients and controls. MicroCT and 2D histomorphometric results were correlated, but 2D analysis appeared to be more sensitive. However, microCT identified a very specific thinning of the trabecular plates in their center that corresponds to the earlier stages of perforations. CONCLUSION: Trabecular plate thinning can be observed and perforations occur on very thin plates in CSIOP patients."

However, the technique suffers from slow image acquisition rates and limited depth of field. Confocal microscopy addresses the depth of field issue via ""optical sectioning and reconstruction"", but only by further reducing the image acquisition rate to repeatedly scan the cell at multiple focal planes. In this paper we describe a technique to perform high speed, extended depth of field (EDF) imaging using a modified ImageStream system whereby high resolution, multimode imagery from thousands of cells is collected in less than a minute with focus maintained over a 16 microm focal range. METHODS: A prototype EDF ImageStream system incorporating a Wavefront Coded element was used to capture imagery from fluorescently labeled beads. Bead imagery was quantitatively analyzed using photometric and morphological features to assess consistency of feature values with respect to focus position. Jurkat cells probed for chromosome Y using a fluorescence in situ hybridization in suspension protocol (FISHIS) were used to compare standard and Wavefront Coded-based EDF imaging approaches for automated chromosome enumeration. RESULTS: Qualitative visual inspection of bead imagery reveals that the prototype ImageStream system with EDF maintains focus quality over a 16 microm focus range. Quantitative analysis shows the extended depth field collection mode has approximately ten-fold less variation in focus-sensitive feature values when compared with standard imaging. Automated chromosome enumeration from imagery of Jurkat cells probed using the FISHIS protocol is significantly more accurate using EDF imaging. CONCLUSIONS: The use of EDF techniques may significantly enhance the quantitation of cell imagery, particularly in applications such as FISH, where small discrete signals must be detected over a wide focal range within the cell."

Epub 2007 Feb 9.,Lyshchik A,Radiology,2007,2007/02/13,,,10.1148/radiol.2431052032,"PURPOSE: To prospectively estimate the accuracy of sonoelastography in the differentiation of benign and metastatic cervical lymph nodes (LNs) in patients suspected of having thyroid or hypopharyngeal cancer, with histologic nodal findings as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the hospital review board; each patient gave written informed consent. One hundred forty-one peripheral neck LNs (60 metastatic, 81 metastasis free) in 43 consecutive patients (22 men, 21 women; mean age, 58 years +/- 13 [standard deviation]) were examined. Patients referred for surgical treatment of suspected thyroid or hypopharyngeal cancer were examined with gray-scale ultrasonography (US), power Doppler US, and sonoelastography. At gray-scale and power Doppler US, the following LN characteristics were evaluated: short-axis diameter, short-to-long-axis diameter ratio, echogenicity, calcifications, and vascularity. A four-point rating scale was used to evaluate the US elastograms for LN visibility, relative brightness, margin regularity, and margin definition. In addition, strains of LN and surrounding neck muscles were measured on elastograms, and the muscle-to-LN strain ratio--that is, the strain index-was calculated. The diagnostic potential of the examined criteria for metastatic involvement was evaluated with univariate analysis and multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression. P < .05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: A strain index greater than 1.5 had high utility in metastatic LN classification, with 98% specificity, 85% sensitivity, and 92% overall accuracy. These results were significantly better than those obtained by using the best gray-scale criterion--that is, a short-to-long-axis diameter ratio greater than 0.5-which had 81% specificity, 75% sensitivity, and 79% overall accuracy. CONCLUSION: Sonoelastography had high accuracy (92%) in the differentiation of benign and metastatic cervical LNs in patients suspected of having thyroid or hypopharyngeal cancer."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From DTI data sets of 30 patients with benign meningiomas, we calculated diffusion tensors and mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps as well as barycentric maps representing the geometrical shape of the tensors. The findings were compared to postoperative histology. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was given by the patients. RESULTS: According to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), FA was the best parameter to differentiate between the subtypes (F=32.2; p<0.0001). Regarding tensor shape, endothelial meningiomas were represented by spherical tensors (80%) corresponding to isotropic diffusion, whereas the fibroblastic meningiomas showed a high percentage (43%) of nonspherical tensors, indicating planar or longitudinal diffusion. The difference was highly significant (F=28.4; p<0.0001) and may be due to the fascicular arrangement of long spindle-shaped tumor cells and the high content of intra- and interfascicular fibers as shown in the histology. In addition, a capsule-like rim of the in-plane diffusion surrounded most meningiomas irrespective of their histological type. CONCLUSION: If these results correlate to the intraoperative findings of meningioma consistency, DTI-based measurement of FA and analysis of the shape of the diffusion tensor is a promising method to differentiate between fibroblastic and other subtypes of benign meningiomas in order to get information about their ""hard"" or ""soft"" consistency prior to removal."

The new instrument, referred to as the fast Fourier phase microscope (f-FPM), provides a factor of 100 higher acquisition rate compared with our previously reported Fourier phase microscope. The resulting quantitative-phase images are characterized by diffraction limited transverse resolution and path-length stability better than 2 nm at acquisition rates of 10 frames/s or more. These features make the f-FPM particularly appealing for investigating the structure and dynamics of live cells over a broad range of time scales. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of examining subcellular structures by digitally processing the amplitude and phase information provided by the instrument. Thus we developed software that can emulate phase contrast and differential interference contrast microscopy images by numerically processing FPM images. This approach adds the flexibility of digitally varying the phase shift between the two interfering beams. The images obtained appear as if they were recorded by variable phase contrast or differential interference contrast microscopes that deliver an enhanced view to the subcellular structure when compared with the typical commercial microscope."

In the present study, we addressed the hypothesis that the morphological features of PP innervation are consistent with an immunomodulatory role for the enteric nervous system. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to collect images through large tissue volumes, yielding a three-dimensional perspective of the neuronal network superimposed on PP follicles from porcine jejunum and human ileum. Peptidergic nerve fibers were found in close apposition to immunocytes within PP subepithelial domes and the adjacent villi. The results suggest that nerve fibers in PP may participate in neuroimmune cross-talk within individual antigen-sampling sites as well as integrate information across multiple antigen-sampling sites."

Forty nodules relative to 29 patients were examined with echo-color Doppler before surgery. After histologic diagnosis, blocks were deparaffinized and prepared for 3-dimensional examination using a stereomicroscope. Echo-color Doppler type I nodules (8 nodules) always corresponded to colloid goiter. Type II and III nodules corresponded to colloid goiter with intralesional hemorrhage or were associated with hyperplastic nodules, follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma minimally invasive, papillary carcinoma, and medullary carcinoma. Of interest was that 9 of 11 follicular lesions were characterized by a large central vessel, which was also evident in echo-color Doppler images. This architectural pattern is not seen in benign nodules or in papillary carcinomas. Comparison with histology suggests that echo-color Doppler images can visualize vessels showing a muscular wall."

This system was designed to quantitatively assess colony morphology and number of colonies in 4-cm(2) culture wells. STUDY DESIGN: Large field-of-view high-resolution fluorescence images of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)- and alkaline phosphatase (AP)-stained bone marrow cell cultures were obtained using an epi-fluorescence microscope and automated scanning stage. Cell nuclei were identified in the DAPI-stained images after removal of fluorescent debris from the image. An Euclidean distance map (EDM) of the segmented cell nuclei was used to cluster cell nuclei into colonies. The automated system was evaluated using 40 tissue culture wells of bone marrow aspirate samples. The results of the automated analysis were compared to the manual tracings of colonies by 3 reviewers. RESULTS: The automated method agreed with all 3 reviewers on average 87.5% of the time. Additionally, reviewers identified other colonies not outlined by the reviewers on average 2.7 times more than the automated method. CONCLUSION: The automated method is a less biased method for identifying CFUs than individual reviewers, it provides more quantitative information about colony morphology than can be obtained manually and it is less time consuming."

METHODS: To standardize and quantitate measurements of Her-2/neu immunoreactivity, we created epithelial-recognition and specific membrane-recognition algorithms, which could image breast cancer cells against a background of stroma, compartmentalize the cancer cell into nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane, and quantitate the degree of Her-2/neu membrane immunoreactivity based on both gray scale intensity and RGB colorimetric determinations. Image acquisition utilized either scanner or microscope with attached camera with a resolution of 20 pixels/10 microm. Areas of 150 whole slides were screened and the regions of interest manually selected for image processing. Three hundred TMA cores were directly processed. Images were acquired by jpg conversion of svs virtual slides or direct jpg photomicrograph capture. Images were then assessed for quality and processed. RESULTS: The digital algorithms successfully created a semi-automated imaging system whose algorithm-based ordinal values for Her-2/neu both strongly correlated with the subjective measurements (intraclass correlation: 0.84; 95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.89) yet exhibited no run variability. In addition, the algorithms generated immunocytochemical measurements of Her-2/neu on an expanded continuous scale, which more reliably distinguished true Her-2/neu positivity from true Her-2/neu negativity (determined by FISH) than subjective or algorithmic ordinal scale measurements. Furthermore, the continuous scale measurements could better resolve different levels of Her-2/neu overexpression than either subjective or algorithmic ordinal interpretation. Other semi-automated analysis systems have been used to measure Her-2/neu and other cellular immunoreactivities, but these either have required proprietary hardware or have been based on luminosity differences alone. In contrast, our algorithms are independent of proprietary hardware and are based on not just luminosity but also many other imaging properties including epithelial recognition and membrane morphology. CONCLUSION: These features provide a more accurate, versatile, and robust imaging analysis platform."

To improve accuracy of cone counting, en-face images are analyzed over extended areas. This is achieved with two separate semiautomated algorithms: (1) a montaging algorithm that joins retinal images with overlapping common features without edge effects and (2) a cone density measurement algorithm that counts the individual cones in the montaged image. The accuracy of the cone density measurement algorithm is high, with >97% agreement for a simulated retinal image (of known density, with low contrast) and for AO images from normal eyes when compared with previously reported histological data. Our algorithms do not require spatial regularity in cone packing and are, therefore, useful for counting cones in diseased retinas, as demonstrated for eyes with Stargardt's macular dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of mammograms of 421 patients who were treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy revealed 41 recurrent tumors. Mammographic findings, location, and histopathologic characteristics were retrospectively compared between primary and recurrent tumors. RESULTS: Recurrent tumors were similar in mammographic appearance to primary tumors in 27 (66%) cases. Of 27 primary tumors that occurred as masses without calcifications, 19 (70%) recurred as a mass, and of the six isolated calcifications, five (83%) recurred with calcifications. Ten (53%) of the 19 recurrent masses and five (100%) of the five recurrent calcifications had morphologic features that were similar to those of the primary tumor. Ninety-two percent (11/12) of the recurrences containing microcalcifications (isolated or associated with a mass) had microcalcifications in their primary tumor. Of 27 masses that recurred, the morphology of the primary tumor was obscured in 13 (48%), ill defined in 10 (37%), and spiculated in four (15%) of the masses. Seventy-six percent (31/41) of recurrences were within the lumpectomy quadrant. In 25 (61%) cases, the histologic findings from the primary tumor and the recurrence were identical. CONCLUSION: The majority of recurrent tumors appear to be mammographically similar to primary tumors. Therefore, it is important to review preoperative mammograms during follow-up of these patients. Although the study population is small, it was noted that mass with spiculated contour is associated with a lower risk for local recurrence."

However, similarities in MR properties across plaque components limit the certainty with which these components can be differentiated. An understanding of MRI's underlying limitations in distinguishing atherosclerotic plaque components, and optimization of key parameters (including the set of components investigated and contrast weightings used) are required. In this study we analyzed endarterectomy specimens using multicontrast MRI and compared the results with matching histological findings to determine the probability of error, an unbiased measure of the underlying error caused by similarity in the spectral characteristics of components. The total error was >40% when five distinct components were investigated, but this was halved when components with similar functions and intensities were grouped together. When three contrast weightings were used to view plaque, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) proved valuable for separating hemorrhage from necrotic core, and ""hemorrhage + necrotic"" from ""loose connective tissue + fibrous tissue."" A two-way interaction between contrast weightings and components demonstrated that the value of a contrast can be exploited or marginalized depending on the choice of contrast weightings used."
17494678,Diffusion tensor microscopy indicates the cytoarchitectural basis for diffusion anisotropy in the human hippocampus,"Shepherd TM, Ozarslan E, Yachnis AT, King MA, Blackband SJ.",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 2007 May;28(5):958-64.,Shepherd TM,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,2007,2007/05/15,PMC8134334,,,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Observing changes to water diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) for particular hippocampal regions may improve the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion tensor MR imaging for hippocampal pathologies like Alzheimer disease and mesial temporal sclerosis. As a first step toward this goal, this study characterized the cytoarchitectural features underlying diffusion anisotropy in human hippocampus autopsy specimens at 60-microm in-plane resolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight-millimeter coronal segments of the hippocampal body were dissected from 5 autopsy specimens (mean = 55.6 +/- 6.2 years of age) with short postmortem intervals to fixation (21.2 +/- 5.7 hours) and no histologic evidence of neuropathology. Diffusion tensor microscopy data were collected from hippocampal specimens by using a 14.1T magnet with a protocol that included 21 unique diffusion gradient orientations (diffusion time = 17 ms, b = 1250 s/mm(2)). The resulting images were used to determine the mean diffusivity, FA, and principal fiber orientation for manually segmented hippocampal regions that included the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum, stratum pyramidale (CA1 and CA3), stratum lacunosum-molecular, hilus, molecular layer, granule cell layer, fimbria, and subiculum. RESULTS: Diffusion-weighted images had high signal-to-noise ratios (31.1 +/- 13.0) and delineated hippocampal anatomy well. Water diffusivity ranged from 1.21 +/- 0.22 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s in the fimbria to 3.48 +/- 0.72 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s in granule cells (analysis of variance, P<.001). Color fiber-orientation maps indicated the underlying microstructures responsible for diffusion anisotropy in the hippocampal lamina. CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor microscopy provided novel microstructural information about the different lamina of the human hippocampus. These ex vivo data obtained at high-magnetic-field strengths can be used to study injury-specific diffusion changes to susceptible hippocampal regions and may lead to more specific MR imaging surrogate markers for Alzheimer disease or epilepsy."

Epub 2007 May 21.,Zhao WY,Acta Neurochir (Wien),2007,2007/05/22,,,10.1007/s00701-007-1161-x,"INTRODUCTION: Haemorrhagic intracranial vertebrobasilar dissection is an uncommon cause of nontraumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and accounts for only 1-10% of non-traumatic SAH. Treatment in the acute phase is considered to be essential because of the high risk of rebleeding and the consequent unfavourable outcome. However, the location, the potential for involvement of eloquent vessels and the histopathological characteristics of the vessel wall make treatment demanding from both a technical and anatomical point of view. We report our experience in the management of this disease. PATIENTS AND TREATMENTS: From 1989 to June 2006, we managed 21 patients with spontaneous haemorrhagic dissection located in the intracranial vertebrobasilar system, 13 patients were treated using an endovascular approach, 1 by surgical clipping, and 7 were managed conservatively. RESULTS: Among the 13 patients treated endovascularly, 7 underwent proximal occlusion, 4 underwent parent artery embolization at the site of dissection, and 2 underwent endovascular trapping. Severe, treatment-related complications due to dislodgement of the thrombus during the procedure occurred in 1 patient, who then died from brainstem ischaemia. One patient died from severe pneumonia and one patient was left disabled from vasospastic ischaemia resulting from severe initial SAH. The remaining 10 patients had satisfactory outcomes: none rebled after treatment and when discharged they had Karnovsky scores of 80-100. Of the 7 conservatively treated patients, three died of rebleeding and four were discharged with Karnovsky scores of 50-100. One patient, who was treated surgically, was discharged with a Karnovsky of 90. CONCLUSION: The high rate of rebleeding and consequent mortality among the patients treated conservatively argues for treatment in the acute phase. Treatment should be guided by each patient's angiomorphology, clinical condition and the experience of the neurosurgical/neuroradiological team. Options include endovascular or surgical trapping of the dissection and proximal occlusion and embolisation of the parent artery at the site of the dissection."

DESIGN: We evaluated by RCM melanocytic lesions showing peripheral streaks on dermoscopy. A digital camera connected to the RCM computer enabled direct analysis of the streaks. The lesions were excised and histopathologically analyzed. SETTING: Dermatology clinic specializing in pigmented lesions. PATIENTS: The study population comprised 7 patients with melanocytic lesions, including 2 melanomas, 4 dysplastic nevi, and 1 compound nevus with spitzoid features. RESULTS: In 6 of the cases, peripheral streaks were visualized on RCM as confluent aggregates composed of bright, ill-demarcated cells. These aggregates were contiguous with the bright central part of the lesion and appeared to be curving around dermal papillae. Of the 6 lesions, 3 with elongated aggregates visualized on RCM harbored peripheral, elongated nests on histopathologic examination, and 2 with shorter, more ill-defined peripheral aggregates visualized on RCM had smaller, more poorly formed peripheral nests on histopathologic examination. The seventh lesion showed few peripheral streaks on dermoscopy; however, corresponding features visualized on RCM showed discrete, dense, round nests aligned in proximity. We did not recognize in the present series distinguishing characteristics on RCM that could differentiate between the peripheral streaks of malignant melanoma and nevi. CONCLUSIONS: Direct dermoscopy-RCM correlation is a feasible method to study streaks and may help to improve the classification methods used in dermoscopy. Additional studies with larger series are needed to confirm our findings and may help elucidate the morphologic and biological nature of peripheral streaks."

In this study, the histomorphologic and immunohistochemical features of gastrointestinal stromal tumors are compared with nuclear morphometric results. METHODS: Morphometric nuclear parameters such as mean area, mean roundness factor, mean form ellipse, mean length and mean perimeter were evaluated in hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of 22 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (9 benign and 13 malignant) by using a computer-assisted image analysis system. Morphometric results were compared with tumor behavior and tumor size, the presence of necrosis, mitotic index, and immunohistochemical expressions of p53 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. RESULTS: We found that tumor necrosis was correlated with mean nuclear roundness factor, mean nuclear form ellipse, mean nuclear length and mean nuclear perimeter (p<0.05). Mitotic index was also correlated with mean nuclear roundness factor and mean nuclear form ellipse (p<0.05). However, no correlation was found between morphometric features and gastrointestinal stromal tumor behavior, tumor size, or index of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and p53 expressions (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, the relative concordance of the morphometric results and general histomorphologic data exhibited the importance of nuclear morphometric analysis in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Studies including larger series of cases investigating detailed nuclear morphometric analysis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors are needed."

AIM: To systematically investigate the features of microvascular proliferation in a large series of surgically treated VMs. METHODS: 107 resection specimens of clinically and histologically well-documented VMs were screened for the presence and extent of microvascular proliferation, based on morphological parameters, microvessel density (MVD), mast cell density (MCD) and proliferative activity (Ki-67 labelling index) of endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The extent of microvascular proliferation was correlated with the histological type of VM and clinical characteristics of patients. RESULTS: Microvascular proliferation was observed in 32 (30%) of all VMs, of which 30 cases seemed to be arteriovenous malformations. MVD in areas of microvascular proliferation was 282 (186)/mm(2) vs 13 (9)/mm(2) in areas with mature vessels. Both ECs and VSMCs in these areas showed high Ki-67 labelling indexes (mean (SD) 15 (18) and 17 (24)/mm(2), respectively). In all lesions, a positive correlation was found between MCD and MVD. Age, sex and location of VM had no predictive value for the occurrence of microvascular proliferation. However, if present, the involved tissue areas were larger and the proliferative activity of EC was higher in male patients than in female patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of microvascular proliferation as a not uncommon feature, congenital arteriovenous malformations provide new insight into the growth behaviour and vascular composition of these lesions."

Epub 2007 Apr 10.,Akhter MP,Bone,2007,2007/05/15,,,10.1016/j.bone.2007.03.019,"INTRODUCTION: Post-menopausal osteoporosis is a disorder of excess skeletal fragility, due partly to changes in bone microstructure. Menopause is known to result in bone loss and reduction in bone mechanical strength. However, the mechanism and nature of microstructural changes at menopause need more detailed description and analyses. The overall hypothesis for this analysis is that the variables describing trabecular bone micro-architecture will be affected by changes in the hormonal status of women just prior to, and early after, last menses, and that volumetric bone density, and trabecular structure will decline significantly. The study was designed to capture true longitudinal transmenopausal changes in three-dimensional (3-D) trabecular bone architecture. Currently, minimal data exist regarding these features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transilial biopsies specimens were obtained from healthy pre-menopausal women (age >46), and repeated at 12 months after the last menstrual period. Bone architecture was quantified in 38 paired specimens using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT-40, Scanco) techniques. Bone biopsies were embedded for histomorphomteric analyses and parts of the analyses have been published elsewhere. Embedded bone biopsies were scanned at 30-mum resolution such that the region of interest was similar to that in the two-dimensional (2-D) histomorphometric analyses. Paired t-tests were used to compare the pre- and post-menopausal bone structural data from each technique. RESULTS: There was good correlation between standard histomorphometric (2-D) and micro-CT (3-D) measurements. Most of the variables characterizing bone structure in post-menopausal women (from micro-CT) significantly decreased (BV/TV, trabecular number, apparent and tissue density). In addition, both trabecular spacing (Tb.S) and the structure model index (SMI) increased in the post-menopausal women suggesting transformation of trabecular bone from plate- to rod-like structure. The 3-D trabecular connectivity density (Conn.D) was negatively correlated with activation frequency (Ac.f). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that 3-D micro-CT measurements (longitudinal) are comparable to those of standard histomorphometry, and that most of the bone structural measurements are sensitive to changes in women's hormonal status across menopause."

Reconstructive procedures are restricted by limited shape and have the disadvantage of severe donor-site morbidity. To overcome these limitations, we used a tissue engineering approach to create a distal thumb bone phalanx, combining magnetically sorted 133+ human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) suspended in successful tested hydrogels for bone formation and porous 3-dimensionally printed scaffolds (3DP) in the shape of a distal thumb bone phalanx. Collagen I and fibrin glue hydrogels with suspended hMSCs were first histologically evaluated in vitro for bone formation after 6 weeks. Then 3DP scaffolds, made from a mix of osteoinductive and -conductive beta-tricalciumphosphate (beta-TCP) and poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL), with hydrogels and suspended hMSCs, were implanted into nude mice subcutaneously for 15 weeks. Histologic evaluation, high-resolution volumetric CT (VCT) scanning, and biomechanical testing confirmed formation of bonelike tissue. Both hydrogels with CD 133+ hMSCs on 3DP scaffolds supported bone formation. Collagen I resulted in radiologically better bone formation. Bone tissue can be successfully tissue engineered with CD 133+ hMSCs, collagen I hydrogels, and porous 3DP beta-TCP/PCL scaffolds."

Predicting the involvement of a nerve on symptoms or magnetic resonance (MR) findings is crucial to the diagnostic process. PURPOSE: To compare symptoms, MR findings, and histological findings between major-nerve schwannomas and intramuscular schwannomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with 36 palpable schwannomas (29 major-nerve schwannomas and seven intramuscular schwannomas) surgically excised and proven histologically were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Frequencies of the Tinel-like sign, split-fat sign, entering and exiting nerve, and low-signal margin indicate the presence of a nerve, and were significantly higher in major-nerve schwannomas than in intramuscular schwannomas. In tumor morphological patterns (target sign, inhomogeneous and homogeneous pattern), there were no significant differences between major-nerve schwannomas and intramuscular schwannomas. Schwannomas showing the target sign histologically tended to be less degenerative. All major-nerve schwannomas and five of the intramuscular schwannomas produced some characteristic symptoms and/or MR findings, but two intramuscular schwannomas did not have any characteristic symptoms and findings. CONCLUSION: In major-nerve schwannomas, the Tinel-like sign, split-fat sign, entering and exiting nerve, and low-signal margin are commonly observed and useful for diagnosis. In intramuscular schwannomas, these characteristic findings are less common, which makes diagnosis difficult."

An important feature of vulnerable plaques is the thickness of the fibrous cap that covers the necrotic core. A thickness of less than 65 microm has been proposed as a value that renders the plaque prone to rupture. This work shows that multiphoton microscopy (MPM) can image the plaque with microm resolution to a depth deeper than 65 microm. The fibrous cap emits primarily second harmonic generation due to collagen, in contrast to the necrotic core and healthy artery, which emits primarily two-photon excited fluorescence from elastin. This gives a good demarcation of the fibrous cap from underlying layers, facilitating the measurement of the fibrous cap thickness. Based on a measure of the collagen/elastin ratio, plaques were detected with a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 81%. Furthermore, the technique gives detailed information on the structure of the collagen network in the fibrous cap. This network ultimately determines the mechanical strength of the plaque. A mechanical model based on this information could yield a measure of the propensity of the plaque to rupture."

Epub 2006 Oct 10.,Eickhoff SB,Cereb Cortex,2007,2006/10/13,,,10.1093/cercor/bhl090,"The secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) of nonhuman primates is located on the parietal operculum. In the monkey, electrophysiological and connectivity tracing studies as well as histological investigations provide converging evidence for 3 distinct cortical areas (SII, PV, and VS) within this region, each of which contains a complete somatotopic map. Although the equivalency of the parietal operculum as the location of SII between humans and nonhuman primates is undisputed, the internal organization of the human SII region is still largely unknown. Based on their topography, we have previously argued that the cytoarchitectonic areas OP 1, OP 4, and OP 3 may constitute the human homologues of areas SII, PV, and VS, respectively. To test this hypothesis, we here examined (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) the somatotopic organization of the human parietal operculum by applying tactile stimulation to the skin at 4 different locations on either side of the body (face, hands, trunk, and legs). The locations of the resulting activation foci were then compared with the cytoarchitectonic maps of this region. Data analysis revealed 2 somatotopic body representations on the lateral operculum in areas OP 1 and OP 4. The functional border between these 2 body maps was defined by a mirror reversal in the somatotopic arrangement and coincided with the cytoarchitectonically defined border between these 2 areas. This somatotopic arrangement closely matches that described for SII and PV in nonhuman primates. The data also suggested a third somatotopic map located deeper inside the Sylvian fissure in area OP 3. Based on the observed topographic arrangement and their functional response characteristics, we conclude that cytoarchitectonic areas OP1, OP 4, and OP 3 on the human parietal operculum constitute the human homologues of primate areas SII, PV, and VS, respectively."

So, we investigated the effects of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and of the caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk on lipid profile evaluated by staining with Nile Red (NR). METHODS: The 7KC-treated human monocytic U937 cells were cultured in the absence or in the presence of the caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk or z-VDVAD-fmk. When staining with NR is performed, neutral and polar lipids have yellow and orange/red emission, respectively, and fluorescence was then analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) and by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) combined with subsequent image processing. The 3D-image sequences were obtained by means of CLSM using spectral analysis, and were analyzed by the factor analysis of medical image sequences algorithm to differentiate spectra inside mixed fluorescence emission and get corresponding specific images. RESULTS: By FCM, comparatively to untreated cells, higher percentages of red fluorescent cells were identified in 7KC-treated cells. Factor curves and images reveal orange and red fluorescence emissions in 7KC-treated cells and show yellow, orange, and red fluorescence emissions in 7KC-treated cells cultured in the presence of z-VAD-fmk or z-VDVAD-fmk. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that investigation by FCM and by spectral analysis in CLSM associated with subsequent image processing provides useful tools to determine the effect of caspase inhibitors on lipid content evaluated with NR. They also favor the hypothesis of relationships between caspase activity and polar lipid accumulation."

Epub 2007 May 5.,de Abreu MR,Skeletal Radiol,2007,2007/05/08,,,10.1007/s00256-007-0298-2,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine the different types of pseudotears of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus caused by the nearby meniscofemoral ligaments (MFLs), and to correlate the presence of these ligaments with patterns of meniscal tear. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study with patients and prospective observatory study with cadaveric material. PATIENTS: Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the knee in 49 patients who had subsequent arthroscopy of the knee performed over a 1-year period at a single institution were reviewed by two readers in consensus for the presence and morphology of the MFLs of Humphry (LH) and Wrisberg (LW). Ten cadaveric knee specimens were used for MRI, anatomic, and histologic study. RESULTS: The LH was present in 55% of patients, the LW in 94%, and both were present in 44.9%. The thickness of the LH and LW ranged from 1-3 mm (mean 1.9, SD 0.61), and from 1-3.8 mm (mean 1.8, SD 0.65) respectively (p > 0.05). A pseudotear in the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus was present in 63% of patients. In 13% the pseudotear was vertically oriented, and in 87% the pseudotear had an anterosuperior to posteroinferior orientation, ranging from 37 to 87 degrees . There was no association between the presence of one or both MFLs and the occurrence of medial or lateral meniscal tears (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Meniscofemoral ligaments are frequent anatomical structures that are found in the majority of knees with MRI. They commonly cause a pseudotear of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus that can be simple, double, or complex in appearance, with vertical or anterosuperior to posteroinferior orientation."

DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four subjects with known corneal guttata. METHODS: Two hundred eight images of corneal endothelium, captured with a noncontact specular microscope were analyzed using the Contour method, which demonstrates endothelial cell density (ECD), coefficient of variation of cell area, percentage of 4- to 8-sided cells as well as the number, area, and coefficient of variation of corneal guttata. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number, surface area, and coefficient of variation of corneal guttata. RESULTS: Corneal position had no significant effect on ECD or on the percentage of endothelial cells with 4, 5, 7, or 8 sides. However, the coefficient of variation of images taken from the central cornea was significantly larger than those taken at the 2- and 6-o'clock positions. In addition, the percentage of hexagonal cells was significantly lower in pictures of the central position compared to those located in the upper paracentral position. The numbers and surface areas of guttata were significantly larger in pictures of the central compared to some paracentral positions. Subjects who had previously undergone cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation did not show different areas of corneal guttata, but exhibited a significantly lower cell density (1825+/-582) compared with unoperated patients (2400+/-457/mm2). Analogously, the only significant change observed in paired comparisons between the operated eye of patients with unilateral cataract extraction with IOL implantation and their unoperated fellow eye was a lower cell density obtained in operated eyes. Compared with normal subjects, subjects with corneal guttata were shown to have a significantly lower ECD, a lower proportion of hexagonal cells, and a higher coefficient of variation of cell area in the central cornea. CONCLUSION: This study supports the finding that corneal guttata mainly affect the central corneal area. A future prospective study using the described Contour detection method would be helpful to evaluate more accurately the risks associated with the evolution of corneal guttata into Fuchs' dystrophy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 726 consecutive patients (361 women, 365 men, mean age 47.6 years+/-20.1 SD) presenting with a soft-tissue mass over a 7-year period. All subjects underwent MRI and final diagnosis was based on biopsy/surgical resection, or clinical follow-up and characteristic imaging findings. The patients were divided according to the presence or absence of FFLs on T2-weighted (T2W) axial MRI and histological diagnosis (non-neoplastic, neoplastic benign, neoplastic malignant). Cases with FFLs were sub-categorized depending upon the proportion of tumour containing FFLs: <1/3, 1/3-2/3 and >2/3, in order to determine whether the proportion of FFLs was useful for differential diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty-four of the 726 (3.3%: confidence interval 2.1-4.9%) soft-tissue masses contained FFLs. One of the 24 (4.1%) was non-neoplastic (one ganglion), 12 (50.0%) were benign neoplasms (nine haemangiomas, two schwannomas, one hamartoma) and 11 (45.9%) were malignant neoplasms (one leiomyosarcoma, one liposarcoma, one malignant fibrous histocytoma, one mxyofibrosarcoma, two primitive neuroectodermal tumours, two synovial sarcomas, one spindle cell sarcoma, and two sarcomas not otherwise specified). The presence of FFLs did not help to differentiate benign from malignant neoplasms. Of the 12 benign neoplasms, 66.7% contained over two-thirds FFLs, the majority of which were haemangiomas. Of the 10 malignant neoplasms, all contained less than two-thirds FFLs: 20% had less than one-third, 80% had one to two-thirds FFLs. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FFLs in soft-tissue tumours referred to a specialist orthopaedic oncology unit is 3.3%. However, the presence of FFLs does not reliably distinguish benign from malignant neoplasms, although all lesions with more than two-thirds FFLs were benign."
17611632,Identifying prostate carcinoma by MALDI-Imaging,"Schwamborn K, Krieg RC, Reska M, Jakse G, Knuechel R, Wellmann A.",Int J Mol Med. 2007 Aug;20(2):155-9.,Schwamborn K,Int J Mol Med,2007,2007/07/06,,,,"Prostate cancer has become one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Although lacking in specificity its diagnosis is still based partially on the serum-based test for prostate-specific antigen. As its pathogenesis has not yet been deciphered, the ongoing search for new and more reliable biomarkers remains a challenge to stratify disease onset and progression. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-Imaging is a promising technique to assist in this endeavor. It delivers accurate mass spectrometric information of the sample's proteins and enables the visualization of the spatial distribution of protein expression profiles and correlation of the information with the histomorphological features of the same tissue section. This study describes the analysis of 22 prostate sections (11 with and 11 without prostate cancer) by MALDI-Imaging. Specific protein expression patterns were obtained for normal and cancerous regions within the tissue sections. Applying a 'support vector machine' algorithm to classify the cancerous from the non-cancerous regions, an overall cross-validation, a sensitivity and specificity of 88, 85.21 and 90.74%, respectively, was achieved. Additionally four distinctively overexpressed peaks were identified: 2,753 and 6,704 Da for non-cancerous glands, and 4,964 and 5,002 Da for cancerous glands. The results of this first clinical study utilizing the new technique of MALDI-Imaging underline its vast potential to identify candidates for more reliable prostate cancer tumor markers and to enlighten the pathogenesis of prostate cancer."

It is unclear whether the steatosis is associated with host factors or the virus itself, although a consistent relationship has been found between steatosis and a necro-inflammatory reaction with the increased secretion of immuno-regulators. A primary sources of inflammatory mediators are mast cells (MCs) bone marrow-derived cells that are detected in both normal and diseased livers. We determined MC density and correlated it with the fibrosis, inflammatory reaction and steatosis observed in the liver biopsies of patients affected by HCV with or without steatosis. All the histological features were assessed using a computer-aided image analysis system. There was a statistically significant difference in MC density between the HCV-infected patients with and without steatosis, with the lower mean value being detected in those without (P < 0.02). Furthermore, a nonstatistically significant difference in fibrosis and inflammation between the two patient groups was found. In conclusion, this is the first study showing a significant increase in MC density in the tissues of patients with chronic HCV infection and histologically documented steatosis."

OBJECTIVE: To study the rate of recovery of bone marrow in patients given myelosuppressive therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia, establish the histologic criteria of recovered marrow, and correlate the recovery pattern with those patients who received a bone marrow transplant by using histology, peripheral blood, immunophenotyping, and computerized morphometry and mathematical slope equation. DESIGN: We studied the post-myelosuppression recovery of the bone marrow to determine patterns and rate of recovery in 135 serial bone marrow biopsies of 51 patients. These patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 group of 28 cases diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, the majority treated with cytarabine (Ara-C) infusion for 7 days and daunorubicin intravenously daily for 3 days (7+3 regimen), and the other control group of 23 cases treated with chemotherapy or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for a variety of hematologic malignancies. All biopsies during the recovery period were obtained before consolidation regimen. We used morphometry to calculate the cellularity and myeloid to erythroid ratio and quantified megakaryocytes CD10 versus time from day 14 onward. The absolute neutrophil and platelet counts for 28 cases were related to histologic recovery. RESULTS: From day 14, we noted a differential slope of recovery of these patients with no difference in male and female patients, P = .45, but a difference between younger and older patients (>58.5 years), P = .03. After regenerative hyperplasia, the cellularity plateaus, the myeloid to erythroid ratio, and the megakaryocytes even out with platelet normalization, and the early CD10+ B cells rise from day 40 onward, P = .01. The patterns of recovery after day 60 of postchemotherapy and posttransplantation patients are similar. Complete histologic and peripheral blood recovery is noted at day 38 and thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: By linear equation using at least 2 trephine biopsy specimens, the projected rate of cellular recovery may be determined, and 5 histologic features are associated with complete histologic recovery."

In previous studies, bone sections were cut in different directions relative to a principle axis of symmetry. This causes a high preparation and measurement effort. We have developed a new acoustic scanning procedure that allows one to measure the angular dependence of the acoustic impedance of cylindrically shaped samples (diameter: 4.4 mm) with a single measurement. Our scanning acoustic microscope was equipped with a rotational stage, and a scanning procedure was developed that measures the surface reflection of the rotating cylinder. It was shown in a previous study that the acoustic impedance derived from the reflection coefficient is highly correlated with the elastic coefficient in the probing direction. From the angular reflection, the independent elastic coefficients were derived using assumptions of transverse isotropy and continuum micromechanical model constraints. This method was applied to the inspection of human femoral bone samples. Four cylinders were prepared from the anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral regions. The measurements were performed with a 50 MHz transducer, providing a lateral resolution of 23 microm. Remarkable structural and elastic variations were observed between the four samples. The means and standard deviations of the derived elastic coefficients were: c33 = 29.9 +/- 5.0 GPa, c11 = 21.9 +/- 2.1 GPa, c12 = 9.2 +/- 1.5 GPa, c13 = 9.7 +/- 1.6 GPa, and c44 = 6.7 +/- 1.2 GPa. The results demonstrate that microstructural and anisotropic elastic tissue parameters can be assessed by ultrasound in very small bone samples."

Bigger vessel size, vessel irregularity, and lower intensity of CD34-positive vessel staining may indicate unfavorable prognosis. OBJECTIVES: Salivary gland cancer (SGC) is a morphologically diverse group of malignancies, the most common histological types being mucoepidermoid, adenoid cystic and ACC, which has the most favorable prognosis of the three. The aim of this research was to study the applicability of automated image analysis as prognostic criteria in ACC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a nationwide study covering SGC patients in Finland during 1991-1996, 34 patients with ACC (15 males, 19 females, aged 19-95 years, mean 55 years) were included. Parameters were measured from CD34-stained samples. RESULTS: In all, 10 385 vessels were measured, of which 9873 were from specimens from patients who were alive 5 years after treatment (n=32, group I) and 512 were from patients who died of disease (n=2, group II). The following results were found in group II versus group I: mean vessel size 469 microm vs 272 microm (p=0.024); vessel irregularity 28.3 microm vs 22.3 microm (p<0.001); CD34 staining intensity 0.555 microm vs 0.584 microm (p=0.024)."

STUDY DESIGN: In tissue counter analysis (TCA) the images are dissected into square elements used for feature calculation. The first class of features is based on the histogram, the co-occurrence matrix and the texture moments. The second class is derived from spectral properties of the wavelet Daubechie 4 and the Fourier transform. Square elements from images of a training set are classified by Classification and Regression Trees analysis. RESULTS: Features from the histogram and the co-occurrence matrix enable correct classification of 94.7% of nevi elements and 92.6% of melanoma elements in the training set. Classification results are applied to individual test set cases. Discriminant analysis based on the percentage of ""malignant elements"" showed correct classification of all nevi cases and 95% of melanoma cases. Features derived from the wavelet and Fourier spectrum showed correct results for 88.8% and 79.3% of nevi and 85.6% and 81.5% of melanoma elements, respectively. CONCLUSION: TCA is a potential diagnostic tool in automatic analysis of melanocytic skin tumors. Histogram and co-occurrence matrix features are superior to the wavelet and the Fourier features."

Thirty extracted carious posterior teeth were fixed, embedded and polymerized in plastic fixation medium. The final thin sections (80mm) were stained with H&E and Masson Goldner's Tricome while others were left unstained. Under Confocal, marked differences between control sound enamel and dentin, and carious area of the samples were observed which illustrated that a correlation existed between the zone of autofluoresence, demineralization and carious enamel and dentin. Compared to CLSM, Image Analyzer only produce two-dimensional images but the histopathological changes were better appreciated by using various staining methods."

Measurement of T1 hypointensities and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) can potentially distinguish lesions with more severe tissue damage. The objective of this study was to use image-guided pathology to determine histological differences between lesions that are abnormal only on T2-weighted images versus lesions that are abnormal on T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and MTR images. METHODS: A total of 110 regions were selected from postmortem magnetic resonance images of 10 multiple sclerosis patients. Regions were classified into three magnetic resonance imaging-defined categories: normal-appearing white matter; abnormal on T2-weighted image only (T2-only); and abnormal on T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and MTR images (T2T1MTR). Myelin status, lesion activity, astrocytosis, serum protein distribution, axonal area, and axonal loss were evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS: Comparisons between groups showed that T2T1MTR regions were more likely to be demyelinated (83% compared with 55% of T2-only regions) and more likely to be chronic inactive lesions (68% compared with 0% of demyelinated T2-only regions). There was no difference between T2-only and T2T1MTR regions in axonal area, but there was a significant difference in axonal count, indicating that axons in the T2T1MTR regions were enlarged relative to those in T2-only regions. INTERPRETATION: Axonal swelling and axonal loss were major pathological features that distinguish T2T1MTR regions from T2-only regions."

To study the physicochemical basis of such interactions, we have developed a technique that combines confocal microscopy of crystals with fluorescence imaging of proteins. In this study, osteopontin (OPN), a protein abundant in urine, was labeled with the fluorescent dye AlexaFluor-488 and added to crystals of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM), the major constituent of kidney stones. In five to seven optical sections along the z axis, scanning confocal microscopy was used to visualize COM crystals and fluorescence imaging to map OPN adsorbed to the crystals. To quantify the relative adsorption to different crystal faces, fluorescence intensity was measured around the perimeter of the crystal in several sections. Using this method, it was shown that OPN adsorbs with high specificity to the edges between 100 and 121 faces of COM and much less so to 100, 121, or 010 faces. By contrast, poly-L-aspartic acid adsorbs preferentially to 121 faces, whereas poly-L-glutamic acid adsorbs to all faces approximately equally. Growth of COM in the presence of rat bone OPN results in dumbbell-shaped crystals. We hypothesize that the edge-specific adsorption of OPN may be responsible for the dumbbell morphology of COM crystals found in human urine."

Epub 2007 May 23.,Einenkel J,Comput Med Imaging Graph,2007,2007/05/25,,,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2007.03.004,"The invasion front pattern of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a conspicuous histological phenomenon, which is assessed without precise criteria. The current study was performed to introduce the classical (C(C)) and discrete compactness (C(D)) as new morphometric parameters for quantification of this pattern. A retrospective analysis of 76 surgically treated patients with cervical carcinoma was conducted and the pattern of invasion was qualitatively classified as closed, finger-like or diffuse, respectively, by two pathologists. After digitization of the histological slides with a field of view of 10.4 mm x 8.3mm, tumor areas were labeled and C(C) and C(D) were computed based on the drawings (binary images). Additionally, intraindividual variation of compactness was evaluated for 12 selected tumors. The qualitative pattern assessment by the pathologists was moderately reproducible with an interobserver agreement of 72% and a kappa coefficient of 0.44. The values of C(C) and C(D) referring to the invasion front patterns assigned by both pathologists were significantly different between the three classified groups (p< or =0.01 and p< or =0.0001), so that, both theoretically and in practice, compactness regards the same morphological feature. In due consideration of the analysis of the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves and the variation coefficient of different tumor regions, C(D) is more suitable for practical use than C(C). Tumors with a microscopic invasion into the parametria and with lymph-vascular space invasion were found to have a lower value of C(D), which indicates a more diffuse pattern of invasion (p=0.028 and p=0.033). We conclude that the discrete compactness C(D) is a new and reproducible parameter for a computer assisted quantification of the invasion front pattern and, thus, defines a further phenotypic feature of SCC of the uterine cervix."

Cellular aberrations inherent to cancer cells, including nuclear size, can currently be detected, but few technologies are available to evaluate adequacy of specimens in real time. The aims of this study are: 1. to determine if near-infrared reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) can be used to assess epithelial/stromal content of core needle breast biopsy samples in real time, 2. to determine if epithelial cell nuclear size can be measured on RCM images, and 3. to test if RCM images can be accurately read for presence/absence of histologically relevant features of malignancy. Breast biopsies are obtained following a medically indicated breast core needle diagnostic biopsy for RCM examination. Acetic acid is used as a contrast agent to visualize structures within breast tissue. Structures are identified and optically serially sectioned, and digital images are cataloged. Relative amounts of epithelial, fatty, and collagenous tissue are determined. RCM biopsies are formalin-fixed and stained for hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) comparison with RCM images. RCM data are comparable to data from H and E sections. Epithelial cell nuclear size is measured on stored digital RCM images. We compare RCM and H and E images from 16 patients and 25 core needle biopsy samples."

Here, we used image analysis in addition to histologic evaluation to determine if quantification of nuclear features could provide additional prognostic information and hence impact prognostic assessments. METHODS: Nuclear image features were extracted from about 200 nuclei of each of 80 patients with DCIS who underwent lumpectomy alone, and received no adjuvant systemic therapy. Nuclear images were obtained from 20 representative nuclei per duct, from each of a group of 5 ducts, in two separate fields, for 10 ducts. Reproducibility of image analysis features was determined, as was the ability of features to discriminate between nuclear grades. Patient information was available about clinical factors (age and method of DCIS detection), pathologic factors (DCIS size, nuclear grade, margin size, and amount of parenchymal involvement), and 39 image features (morphology, densitometry, and texture). The prognostic effects of these factors and features on the development of invasive breast cancer were examined with Cox step-wise multivariate regression. RESULTS: Duplicate measurements were similar for 89.7% to 97.4% of assessed image features. For the pooled assessment with approximately 200 nuclei per patient, a discriminant function with one densitometric and two texture features was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with nuclear grading, and provided 78.8% correct jackknifed classification of a patient's nuclear grade. In multivariate assessments, image analysis nuclear features had significant prognostic associations (p <or= 0.05) with the development of invasive breast cancer. Texture (difference entropy, p < 0.001; contrast, p < 0.001; peak transition probability, p = 0.01), densitometry (range density, p = 0.004), and measured margin (p = 0.05) were associated with development of invasive disease for the pooled data across all ducts. CONCLUSION: Image analysis provided reproducible assessments of nuclear features which quantitated differences in nuclear grading for patients. Quantitative nuclear image features indicated prognostically significant differences in DCIS, and may contribute additional information to prognostic assessments of which patients are likely to develop invasive disease."

Occlusions, fate of side branches could be detected during the clinical diagnostic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, computed tomography; however, the forensic medical determination of cause of death, identification of complications needs a careful post-mortem investigation. The injection-corrosive method seems to be a useful assistance in the characterisation of pathomorphological changes after stent implantation. Besides the classical techniques of histology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopic investigation we have introduced a new synthetic resin corrosion cast method. This three-dimensional corrosion cast preparation may provide new data about the actual morphological condition of the coronary vessels and a better understanding of the pathomechanisms of sudden cardiac death after percutaneous coronary intervention."

However, segmental T2* assessment in heart can be affected by the presence of geometrical and susceptibility artefacts, which can act on different segments in different ways. The aim of this study was to assess T2* value distribution in the left ventricle and to develop a correction procedure to compensate for artefactual variations in segmental analysis. MRI was performed in four groups of 22 subjects each: healthy subjects (I), controls (II) (thalassemia intermedia patients without iron overload), thalassemia major patients with mild (III) and heavy (IV) iron overload. Three short-axis views (basal, median, and apical) of the left ventricle were obtained and analyzed using custom-written, previously validated software. The myocardium was automatically segmented into a 16-segment standardized heart model, and the mean T2* value for each segment was calculated. Punctual distribution of T2* over the myocardium was assessed, and T2* inhomogeneity maps for the three slices were obtained. In group I, no significant variation in the mean T2* among slices was found. T2* showed a characteristic circumferential variation in all three slices. The effect of susceptibility differences induced by cardiac veins was evident, together with low-scale variations induced by geometrical artefacts. Using the mean segmental deviations as correction factors, an artefact correction map was developed and used to normalize segmental data. The correction procedure was validated on group II. Group IV showed no significant presence of segmental artefacts, confirming the hypothesis that susceptibility artefacts are additive in nature and become negligible for high levels of iron overload. Group III showed a greater variability with respect to normal subjects. The correction map failed to compensate for these variations if both additive and percentage-based corrections were applied. This may reinforce the hypothesis that true inhomogeneity in iron deposition exists."

Epub 2007 Aug 16.,Wimpissinger F,J Urol,2007,2007/08/21,,,10.1016/j.juro.2007.05.128,"PURPOSE: We investigated the characteristics and diagnosis of primary asymptomatic ureteral calculi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a period of 12 years asymptomatic ureteral stones were prospectively investigated at the Urological Stone Center. We studied mode of diagnosis, stone size, localization, composition, hydronephrosis grade and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2006 a total of 40 patients with asymptomatic ureteral stones were identified among 3,711 patients with ureteral stones (1.1%). Mean age of the 33 male and 7 female asymptomatic patients was 58.3 years (range 28.1 to 87.1). Localization of stones was 19 proximal, 3 mid and 18 in the distal ureter. Mean stone size was 10.0 mm (+/-6). Mode of diagnosis of asymptomatic calculi was randomly diagnosed hydronephrosis in 10 patients (25%), microscopic hematuria in 8 (20%), randomly diagnosed stone on other than urological x-ray examination in 13 (32.5%) and stone diagnosed during followup after previous nephrolithiasis in 9 patients (22.5%). Primary therapy was extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in 35 patients (87.5%), ureterorenoscopic lithotripsy in 4 (10%), spontaneous stone passage before scheduled treatment in 1 and open ureteroneocystostomy in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: De novo asymptomatic ureteral calculi do exist. Characteristics of this small group of patients with ureterolithiasis have not been described thus far. Diagnosis is usually made during routine health care examinations, during the evaluation of nonurological diseases and during followup of patients who previously had nephrolithiasis. A large proportion of patients exhibit some degree of hydronephrosis as a sign of silent obstruction."

Thus, the prognostic value of the malignancy grading score (MGS) classification system was evaluated in 82 patients with early-stage cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages IA2, IB, and IIA) and long-time follow-up (5-16 years). Recurrence or not, the likelihood of lymph node metastases and reproducibility of the MGS semiquantitative system were tested. The prognostic power of the MGS to identify high-risk cases prone to recurrence in patients lacking lymph node metastases at primary surgery was a main purpose of the present study. The semiquantitative MGS classification system was performed independently by 2 pathologists unaware of prognosis and clinical data using light microscopy. Routine hematoxylin and eosin sections from surgical specimens were used, and investigation area was defined in the deep part of the tumor. Data-based image analysis was also used to investigate if objective morphometric parameters could add any prognostic power to MGS. The 5-year survival for the whole patient group was 92%. Malignancy grading score of greater than 17 risk points was statistically highly significant in predicting relapse and lymph node metastases (n = 82). High-risk cases lacking lymph node metastases (n = 70) were also statistically associated with high MGS. Depth of invasion and vascular invasion were statistically related to recurrence. Objective image analysis of nuclear parameters was of no additional statistical value for the prediction of outcome. The MGS classification system proved to be a useful tool in predicting recurrence and lymph node metastases and, most importantly, was a predictor of high-risk patients without metastases at primary surgery."
17922594,Quantification of the morphologic features of fibroepithelial tumors of the breast,"McKenna AM, Pintilie M, Youngson B, Done SJ.",Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2007 Oct;131(10):1568-73. doi: 10.5858/2007-131-1568-QOTMFO.,McKenna AM,Arch Pathol Lab Med,2007,2007/10/10,,,10.5858/2007-131-1568-QOTMFO,"CONTEXT: Phyllodes tumors of the breast are uncommon, comprising 0.3% to 0.9% of female primary breast tumors. Owing in part to their rarity, definitive, objective, reproducible morphologic criteria that reliably distinguish benign from low-grade malignant or malignant phyllodes tumors have yet to be established. OBJECTIVE: To use image analysis to quantitate and compare morphologic features of different groups of fibroepithelial tumors (FETs) of the breast. DESIGN: Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of 41 FETs previously identified as fibroadenoma, benign phyllodes, low-grade malignant phyllodes, or high-grade malignant phyllodes were blinded and studied using a Leica DMRA2 microscope and OpenLab Image Analysis software. Features measured included mitotic rate per 10 high-power fields, stromal cellularity, nuclear size, stromal overgrowth, and the largest and smallest stromal-epithelial surface area ratios. Epithelial appearance was measured on a semiquantitative basis. Features of each case including tumor size, margin status, and the presence of necrosis or heterologous elements were also considered; these data were retrieved from surgical pathology reports. RESULTS: Quantitative measures of stromal cellularity, stromal-epithelial ratio, mitotic rate, stromal overgrowth, and mean nuclear diameter were developed and found to stratify a population of FETs by the current classification system of fibroadenoma, benign, and low-grade or high-grade malignant phyllodes tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative morphologic features of FETs can be used to stratify these tumors by subtype. Use of these quantitative criteria could reduce interrater variability in histologically identifying FETs by subclass."

Currently, there is no accurate early diagnostic technique for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, little is understood regarding the early progression of this disease. We have imaged multiphoton interactions of endogenous tissue constituents from normal and abnormal ovarian biopsies that were kept viable during transport from the operating room and microscopy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The ovarian surface and underlying stroma were assessed with two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG). High-resolution, optically sectioned images were analyzed for epithelial morphology based on 2PEF and collagen density and structural integrity based on SHG. Additionally, multiwavelength 2PEF provided an estimation of the cellular redox ratio of epithelial cells. RESULTS: Normal tissue exhibited a uniform epithelial layer with highly structured collagen in the stroma, whereas abnormal tissue exhibited varied epithelium with large cells and substantial quantitative changes to the collagen structure. Samples from patients at high risk for developing ovarian cancer (based on their personal/family history of cancer) exhibited highly variable cellular redox ratios and changes in collagen structure that trended toward cancer samples. CONCLUSION: This study highlights differences in endogenous signals in viable ovarian biopsies based on quantitative collagen structural changes and redox ratio estimates that may lead to improved detection and further insights in ovarian cancer, particularly in the early stages of the disease."

In the brain, the presence or absence of gadolinium enhancement is often an indicator of tumor invasiveness and/or grade. In the spinal cord, however, contrast enhancement has been shown in all tumor types, regardless of grade. In this study the authors explore the incidence of nonenhancing tumors of the spinal cord and the clinical course of patients with these lesions. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in which investigators examined the patterns of enhancement of histologically proven intramedullary spinal cord tumors that had been evaluated at the Mayo Clinic between 1998 and 2002. The tumors that did not enhance were the subject of this report. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients with intramedullary tumors were evaluated. Of those, 11 patients (9%) had tumors that did not enhance. Histologically, a majority of tumors were astrocytomas (eight low-grade and two high-grade lesions); one tumor was a subependymoma. Morphologically, most of the tumors were diffuse and none had associated cysts. Tumors spanned from two to seven levels and were located throughout the spinal cord (four cervical, three cervicothoracic, one thoracic, and three thoracolumbar). Biopsy procedures were performed in eight patients, subtotal resection was performed in two, and gross-total resection in one. After a mean follow-up period of 19 months, tumors remained stable in eight patients but progressed in three, two of whom died. CONCLUSIONS: A number of intramedullary spinal cord tumors will not enhance after addition of contrast agents. The absence of enhancement does not imply the absence of tumor."

In diagnosis, the tissue image is classified into the tumor and nontumor classes. In Gleason grading, which characterizes tumor aggressiveness, the image is classified as containing a low- or high-grade tumor. The image sets used in this paper consisted of 367 and 268 color images for the diagnosis and Gleason grading problems, respectively, and were captured from representative areas of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue retrieved from tissue microarray cores or whole sections. The primary contribution of this paper is to aggregate color, texture, and morphometric cues at the global and histological object levels for classification. Features representing different visual cues were combined in a supervised learning framework. We compared the performance of Gaussian, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine classifiers together with the sequential forward feature selection algorithm. On diagnosis, using a five-fold cross-validation estimate, an accuracy of 96.7% was obtained. On Gleason grading, the achieved accuracy of classification into low- and high-grade classes was 81.0%."

IF is currently assessed by semiquantitative analysis, but automatic color image analysis may be a more reliable, reproducible method to evaluate IF. We performed a retrospective analysis to calculate IF on routine renal biopsies 1 year after transplantation. METHODS: Data were obtained from MO2ART, a prospective multicenter trial in which the cyclosporine microemulsion dose was adjusted based on C(2) levels. We included 26 patients in whom routine renal biopsy at 1 year was available from two centers. For each biopsy, a section was analyzed by a program of color segmentation image that automatically extracted green-colored areas characteristic of IF. Results were expressed as percent IF and grade namely grade I, <25%; grade II, 25% to 50%; and grade III, >50%. The results were compared according to clinical and biological data. RESULTS: The 26 patients had a mean IF score of 0.35 +/- 0.04. We observed 34.6% CAN grade I; 46.1%, grade II; and 19.2%, grade III. Serum creatinine at 3 years was greater in the higher grade of automated IF by repeated ANOVA. CONCLUSION: Automatic quantification of IF on routine biopsy at 1 year after transplantation was predictive of renal outcome. This technique may provide an interesting tool for the early diagnosis of CAN after renal transplantation."

The usefulness of FibroScan in children with chronic liver diseases is unknown. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility of liver stiffness measurement and to compare FibroScan, Fibrotest, and aspartate transaminase to platelets ratio index (APRI) with liver biopsy for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in children with chronic liver diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 2004 and October 2005, 116 consecutive children with chronic liver diseases were prospectively included. All except 1 child (58 boys, mean age 10.7 years) could have noninvasive tests for fibrosis: FibroScan, Fibrotest, and APRI, and, when necessary, a liver biopsy (n = 33). RESULTS: FibroScan, Fibrotest, and APRI were correlated with clinical or biological parameters of chronic liver diseases, but the FibroScan marker correlated most with all parameters. By histology, the METAVIR fibrosis category score was F1 in 7 cases, F2 in 8 cases, F3 in 6 cases, and F4 in 12 cases. FibroScan, Fibrotest, and APRI were significantly correlated with the METAVIR fibrosis score. For the diagnosis of cirrhosis, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88, 0.73, and 0.73 for FibroScan, Fibrotest, and APRI, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that liver stiffness measurement is feasible in children and is related to liver fibrosis. A specific probe dedicated to children and slender patients has thus been developed and is currently under evaluation. The FibroScan equipped with this specific probe could become a useful tool for the management of chronic liver diseases in children."

Previous structural studies of membrane fusion proteins have largely used crystallography of static molecular fragments, in isolation of their transmembrane domains. In this study we have produced purified, irradiated SARS-CoV virions that retain their morphology, and are fusogenic in cell culture. We used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to investigate conformational changes that occur in the entire spike of intact virions when they bind to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have shown that ACE2 binding results in structural changes that appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion, and precisely localized the receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the entire spike. Furthermore, our results show that receptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion are distinct steps, and that each spike can bind up to three ACE2 molecules. The SARS-CoV spike provides an ideal model system to study receptor binding and membrane fusion in the native state, employing cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis."
17784937,Fractal dimension as a quantitator of the microvasculature of normal and adenomatous pituitary tissue,"Di Ieva A, Grizzi F, Ceva-Grimaldi G, Russo C, Gaetani P, Aimar E, Levi D, Pisano P, Tancioni F, Nicola G, Tschabitscher M, Dioguardi N, Baena RR.",J Anat. 2007 Nov;211(5):673-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2007.00804.x.

Several analytical methods aimed at quantifying the vascular system in two-dimensional histological sections have been proposed, with very discordant results. In this study we investigated the non-Euclidean geometrical complexity of the two-dimensional microvasculature of normal pituitary glands and pituitary adenomas by quantifying the surface fractal dimension that measures its space-filling property. We found a statistical significant difference between the mean vascular surface fractal dimension estimated in normal versus adenomatous tissues (P = 0.01), normal versus secreting adenomatous tissues (P = 0.0003), and normal versus non-secreting adenomatous tissues (P = 0.047), whereas the difference between the secreting and non-secreting adenomatous tissues was not statistically significant. This study provides the first demonstration that fractal dimension is an objective and valid quantitator of the two-dimensional geometrical complexity of the pituitary gland microvascular network in physiological and pathological states. Further studies are needed to compare the vascular surface fractal dimension estimates in different subtypes of pituitary tumours and correlate them with clinical parameters in order to evaluate whether the distribution pattern of vascular growth is related to a particular state of the pituitary gland."

In a sample of elderly cadaveric specimens, using radiographic, gross morphological, and histological investigation, we demonstrate that heel spurs are generally not found in the trajectory of traction from the plantar aponeurosis enthesis or plantar muscles. Rather, they are variably associated with soft tissues including loose connective tissue, fibrocartilage, muscle, and aponeurosis. Furthermore, the bony trabeculae of the spur are not aligned in the direction of soft tissue traction, but rather in the direction of stress on the calcaneus during walking and standing. These results substantiate the view that the heel spur may be a skeletal response to stress and may serve to protect the bone against the development of microfractures."

METHODS: During a 1-year period, 132 patients with IDC underwent surgical treatment. All patients underwent mammography and high-resolution sonography, and the findings were reported according to the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. Tumors were classified as ""pure IDC"" and ""IDC with an intraductal component"" by histopathologic evaluation. We compared mammographic and sonographic features between the above 2 groups and attempted to correlate them with histopathologic findings. We also investigated separate and combined sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies of both mammography and breast sonography for showing intraductal components. Finally, imaging measurements were compared with pathologic measurements. RESULTS: One hundred four (79%) of the 132 IDCs contained an intraductal component. Patients with IDC with an intraductal component showed calcifications on mammography and showed an echogenic halo, duct dilatation, calcifications, and increased vascularity in surrounding tissue on sonography more frequently than patients with pure IDC. The sensitivities of mammography, sonography, and their combined assessment for detection of an intraductal component were 55%, 80%, and 86%, respectively. The combined assessment (r = 0.90) measured the extent of the tumor more accurately than mammography (r = 0.71) or sonography (r = 0.79) separately. CONCLUSIONS: Combined assessment with mammography and sonography offers more accurate information for the presence of an intraductal component and the extent of a tumor than each separate assessment."

Experienced histopathologists review the histological slides acquired from biopsy specimen in order to outline malignant areas. Recently, improvements in imaging technologies in terms of histological image analysis led to the discovery of virtual histological slides. In this technique, a computerized microscope scans a glass slide and generates virtual slides at a resolution of 0.25 mum/pixel. As the recognition of intrinsic cancer areas is time consuming and error prone, in this study we develop a novel method to tackle automatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck detection problem in high-resolution, wholly-scanned histopathological slides. RESULTS: A density-based clustering algorithm improved for this study plays a key role in the determination of the corrupted cell nuclei. Using the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) Classifier, experimental results on seven head and neck slides show that the proposed algorithm performs well, obtaining an average of 96% classification accuracy. CONCLUSION: Recent advances in imaging technology enable us to investigate cancer tissue at cellular level. In this study we focus on wholly-scanned histopathological slides of head and neck tissues. In the context of computer-aided diagnosis, delineation of malignant regions is achieved using a powerful classification algorithm, which heavily depends on the features extracted by aid of a newly proposed cell nuclei clustering technique. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate a high accuracy of the proposed method."

We use MANTIS, a freely available combined x-ray, electron, and optical Monte Carlo transport package which models the indirect detection processes in columnar screens, interaction by interaction. The code has been previously validated against published optical distributions. In this article, initial validation results are provided concerning the blur for particular designs of phosphor screens for which some details with respect to the columnar geometry are available from scanning electron microscopy. The polyenergetic x-ray spectrum utilized comes from a database of experimental data for three different anode/filter/kVp combinations: Mo/Mo at 28 kVp, Rh/Rh at 28 kVp, and W/Al at 42 kVp. The x-ray spectra were then filtered with breast tissue (3, 4, and 6 cm thickness), compression paddle, and support base, according to the oblique paths determined by the incidence angle. The composition of the breast tissue was 50%/50% adipose/glandular tissue mass ratio. Results are reported on the pulse-height statistics of the light output and on spatial blur, expressed as the response of the detector to a pencil beam with a certain incidence angle. Results suggest that the response is nonsymmetrical and that the resolution properties of a tomosynthesis system vary significantly with the angle of x-ray incidence. In contrast, it is found that the noise due to the variability in the number of light photons detected per primary x-ray interaction changes only a few percent. The anisotropy in the response is not less in screens with absorptive backings while the noise introduced by variations in the depth-dependent light output and optical transport is larger. The results suggest that anisotropic imaging performance across the detector area can be incorporated into reconstruction algorithms for improving the image quality of breast tomosynthesis. This study also demonstrates that the assessment of image quality of breast tomosynthesis systems requires a more complete description of the detector response beyond local, center measurements of resolution and noise that assume some degree of symmetry in the detector performance."

In particular, we obtained two-photon excited autofluorescence (AF) and second-harmonic generation (SHG) images of the enamel, dentin, and periodontal ligaments (PLs) and constructed three-dimensional projections of sequentially and axially acquired images. We found that the enamel has a strong two-photon AF signal, clearly revealing the structures of the enamel rods. The dentin, on the other hand, has both AF and SHG signals. The contrast provided by the combination of these two imaging modalities can be used to reveal the structure of peritubular dentin and to distinguish the less mineralized circumpulpal dentins. The SHG and multiphoton AF imaging also showed the structure of the PL and the distribution of cells around the PL, respectively. For comparison, we also obtained scanning electron microscopy images of the enamel, dentin, circumpulpal dentin, and the PL. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using multiphoton microscopy to visualize the major constituents of teeth, including enamel, dentin, and the PL, and the potential of this minimally invasive technique for monitoring the morphological developments during tooth regeneration."

Epub 2007 Sep 22.,Winckle G,Pharm Res,2008,2007/09/25,,,10.1007/s11095-007-9416-z,"OBJECTIVE: Our understanding of the differential effects of topically applied vehicles on solute partitioning and diffusion within the skin is presently limited. In this work, in vitro epidermal partitioning, penetration and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) imaging studies were used to assess the distribution of 2-naphthol across human epidermis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four commonly used liquid vehicles (100% water, 20% propylene glycol (PG)/water, 50% ethanol (EtOH)/water and 100% isopropyl myristate (IPM)) were used. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The maximum flux and membrane retention of 2-naphthol from 50% EtOH/water was almost an order of magnitude or larger than from the other vehicles evaluated whereas IPM resulted in the highest membrane retention and lowest membrane penetration for 2-naphthol than other vehicles. MPLSM studies showed that 2-naphthol solute partitioned favourably into the intercellular lipids and that there was a vehicle-dependent uptake of 2-naphthol into corneocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated evaluation using in vitro penetration, epidermal retention and MPLSM imaging has shown that vehicle effects on skin penetration occurs by an alteration in the distribution of solutes between the corneocytes and intercellular lipids in addition to the well known mechanisms of altered partitioning into the stratum corneum and enhanced epidermal diffusion."

The aim of this study is to check the discrimination power of texture features for the automatic identification of diagnostic significant regions in CLSM views of skin lesions. METHODS: In tissue counter analysis (TCA) the images are dissected in equal square elements, where different classes of features are calculated out. Features defined in the spatial domain are based on histogram (grey level distribution) and co-occurrence matrix (grey level combinations). The features defined in the frequency domain are based on spectral properties of the wavelet Daubechie 4 transform (texture exploration at different scales) and the Fourier transform (global texture properties are localized in the spectrum). Hundred cases of benign common nevi and malignant melanoma were used as the study set. Classification was done with CART (Classification and Regression Trees) analysis which splits the set of square elements into homogenous terminal nodes and generates a set of splitting rules. RESULTS: Features based on the wavelet transform provide the best results with 96.0% of correctly classified elements from benign common nevi and 97.0% from malignant melanoma. The classification results are relocated to the images by use of the splitting rules as diagnostic aid. The discriminated square elements are highlighted in the images, showing tissue with features in good accordance with typical diagnostic CLSM features. CONCLUSION: Square elements with more than 80% of discrimination power enable the identification of diagnostic highly significant parts in confocal microscopic views of malignant melanoma."

The material for the study consisted of 58 chromophobe carcinomas and 16 oncocytomas. At least 100 nuclei per case were segmented from images of DAPI-stained slides. The geometric and texture features were extracted and used for analysis. Significant differences between RO and ChRCC were found in all the analyzed parameters, however overlapping of the features exists. None of the constructed models permitted to classify cases in concordance with diagnoses."

The first step for automatic image analysis is segmentation. However, touching cells bring the difficulty for traditional segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm which can reliably handle touching cells segmentation. Robust estimation and color active contour models are used to delineate the outer boundary. Concave points on the boundary and inner edges are automatically detected. A concave vertex graph is constructed from these points and edges. By minimizing a cost function based on morphological characteristics, we recursively calculate the optimal path in the graph to separate the touching cells. The algorithm is computationally efficient and has been tested on two large clinical dataset which contain 207 images and 3898 images respectively. Our algorithm provides better results than other studies reported in the recent literature."

The time lapse microscopy imaging produces large volumes of image sequence collections which requires fast and robust automatic segmentation of cell boundaries to utilize further automated tools such as cell tracking to quantify and classify cell behavior. This paper presents a methodology that is based on utilizing the temporal context of the cell image sequences to accurately delineate the boundaries of non-homogeneous cells. A novel flux tensor-based detection of moving cells provides initial localization that is further refined by a multi-feature level set-based method using an efficient additive operator splitting scheme. The segmentation result is processed by a watershed-based algorithm to avoid merging boundaries of neighboring cells. By utilizing robust features, the level-set algorithm produces accurate segmentation for non-homogeneous cells with concave shapes and varying intensities."

Inaccurate histologic grading can result in inappropriate treatment for a given patient. Computational analysis of breast cancers offers an operator-independent method for histologic grading that should enhance grading reliability. We present the initial efforts to develop computational technologies that may be used to automatically and objectively estimate the histologic grade of breast cancer tumors. The approach utilizes image processing and shape analysis of imaged histologic sections. Our work is based on the hypothesis that cellular structures found in breast cancer tumors can be transformed into distinct high-resolution shape distributions using geometric measures from stochastic geometry. The resulting shape distributions define well-populated regions of the associated high-dimensional space. Mapping an unknown breast cancer sample into this high-D space and determining to which region it belongs will allow for the automatic estimation of its histologic grade.

Various feature selection (or extraction) and classification algorithms have been attempted with success. However, some feature selection processes are complex and the number of features used can be quite large. We propose a new feature selection method based on level-set statistics. This procedure is simple and, when used with support vector machines (SVM), only a small number of features is needed to achieve satisfactory accuracy that is comparable to those using more sophisticated features. Therefore, the classification can be completed in much shorter time. We use multi-class support vector machines as the classification tool. Numerical results are reported to support the viability of this new procedure."

Abnormal thinning, thickening, or variation in thickness can occur in familial hematuria, diabetes mellitus, and Alport syndrome, respectively. We propose image processing methods for the segmentation and measurement of the GBM. The methods include the split and merge algorithm, morphological image processing, skeletonization, and statistical analysis of the width of the GBM. The proposed methods were applied to 34 TEM images of six patients. The mean and standard deviation of normal GBM were estimated to be 368 +/- 177 nm; those of thin GBMs associated with familial hematuria were 216 +/- 95 nm; and those of thick GBM due to diabetic nephropathy were 1094 +/- 361 nm. Comparative analysis of the results of image processing with manual measurements by an experienced renal pathologist indicated low error in the range of 12 +/- 9 nm."

Our approach includes image processing of the distance-transform domain, and a discrete-boundary formulation of morphological operators, to speed up the 3D watershed segmentation. The adjustment for connectivity criteria, as well as other tuning parameters, come from the Nyquist sampling criterion, applied to spatial resolution, and are obtained from biological considerations, such as the average size of a normal cell. We also combined both enhancements in 3D and present the mathematical background as well as visual results."

The aim of this study was to quantify the histological image features of microscopic thyroid images in order to classify varying tissue types. Five typical histological thyroid tissues were characterized using seven image features including hue, brightness, standard deviation of brightness, entropy, energy, regularity, and fractal analysis. Statistical stepwise selection and multiple discriminant analysis were then used to classify the features. The results show all of the features are significant and our algorithm has the capability of differentiating histological tissue types. The algorithm is applied utilizing quad-tree based region splitting methods to segment the tissue regions from the heterogeneous microscopic image. The preliminary results show the system has good performance for tissue segmentation."

The detection and classification of morphological cellular abnormalities represents the foundation of classical histopathology and remains an important mainstay in the clinic. More recently, significant effort is being expended towards the development of noninvasive modalities for the detection of cancer at an early stage, when therapeutic interventions are highly successful. Methods that rely on the detection of optical signatures represent one class of such approaches that have yielded promising results. In our study, we have applied two spectroscopic imaging approaches to systematically identify in a quantitative manner the fluorescence and light scattering signatures of subcellular abnormalities that are associated with cellular transformation. Notably, we find that tryptophan images reveal not only intensity but also localization differences between normal and human papillomavirus immortalized cells, possibly originating from changes in the expression, 3D packing and organization of proteins and protein-rich subcellular organelles. Additionally, we detect alterations in cellular metabolism through quantitative evaluation of the NADH, FAD fluorescence and the corresponding redox ratio. Finally, we use light scattering spectroscopy to identify differences in nuclear morphology and subcellular organization that occur from the nanometer to the micrometer scale. Thus, these optical approaches provide complementary biomarkers based on endogenous fluorescence and scattering cellular changes that occur at the molecular, biochemical and morphological level. Since they obviate the need for staining and tissue removal and can be easily combined, they provide desirable options for further clinical development and assessment."

Epub 2007 Sep 21.,Drzezga A,Neuroimage,2008,2007/10/27,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.020,"Semantic dementia (SD) is a rare clinical syndrome, assigned to the group of frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD). Histopathological analysis has not revealed the deposition of amyloid plaques in the majority of SD cases, in contrast to dementia of the Alzheimer type (AD). However, based on clinical examination alone a reliable differentiation of the underlying pathology cannot be guaranteed, i.e. AD and SD may be confused in some cases. Our aim was to determine, whether AD and SD can be differentiated in vivo by means of amyloid plaque PET imaging. In groups of AD and SD patients, matched for gender, age and overall degree of cognitive impairment, cerebral glucose metabolism was examined with [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and cerebral amyloid plaque density was assessed using [(11)C]6-OH-BTA-1 (PIB)-PET. A volume-of-interest analysis (VOI), using the cerebellum as a reference region, and voxel-based statistical group comparisons (SPM2) were carried out between the patient groups and matched groups of healthy controls. To control for a potential influence of atrophy on the PET findings, a correction of partial volume effects was performed. Characteristic patterns of hypometabolism could be demonstrated in both clinically defined AD and SD with some regional overlap and subtle differences (AD: bilateral posterior cingulate, temporoparietal and frontal cortex; SD: left>right polar temporal, frontal mesial cortex). Compared with healthy controls, significant [(11)C]PIB amyloid plaque tracer binding was observed only in patients with AD (in bilateral temporoparietal, frontal and posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus) but not in SD. This difference in amyloid plaque deposition could be reproduced in direct statistical comparison of AD and SD and clearly extended the metabolic differences between the patient groups. These findings support the notion that SD can be diagnosed in vivo as a separate entity from AD using amyloid plaque imaging. In general, amyloid plaque PET may complement neuropsychological assessment regarding reliable differential diagnosis of AD and FTLD dementias based on characterization of underlying pathology and may improve the definition of individual prognosis and the selection of patients for scientific trials."

The neuropathological hallmarks include extracellular senile plaques consisting of deposited beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. Neuroinflammation and activation of astrocytes are also well-established features of AD neuropathology; however, the relationships between astrocytes and Abeta deposition remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that adult mouse astrocytes internalize and degrade Abeta deposits in brain sections prepared from human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. In the present study, we demonstrate that cultured adult, but not neonatal mouse astrocytes, respond morphologically and degrade Abeta deposits present in human AD brain. We also transplanted astrocytes isolated from enhanced green fluorescent protein expressing adult and neonatal mice into the hippocampi of human Abeta plaque-bearing transgenic APPSwe+PS1dE9 (APdE9) mice and their wild-type littermates and followed the migration and localization of these astrocytes by confocal microscopy upto 7 days after transplantation. Posttransplantation the astrocytes localized as aggregates or thin strings of many cells within the hippocampi of APdE9 and wild-type mice and showed limited migration from the injection site. Interestingly, most of the transplanted astrocytes were found near Abeta deposits in the hippocampi of APdE9 mice. In contrast to findings in ex vivo degradation assay, confocal microscopy revealed that both adult and neonatal transplanted astrocytes internalized human Abeta immunoreactive material in vivo. These results support the role of astrocytes as active Abeta clearing cells in the CNS that may have important implications for future development of therapeutic strategies for AD."

We used multiple-labeling immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy, and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry to examine the expression of SNAP-25 in excitatory and inhibitory terminals from different rat and human brain areas. Glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals were identified by staining for the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGLUT1), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), or the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT). In all examined areas GABAergic terminals did not display detectable levels of SNAP-25, whereas glutamatergic terminals expressed the protein to a variable extent. Codistribution analysis revealed a high colocalization between pixels detecting SNAP-25 labeling and pixels detecting vGLUT1 immunoreactivity. On the contrary, a low degree of pixel colocalization, comparable to that between two unrelated antigens, was detected between SNAP-25 and vGAT, thus suggesting a random overlap of immunofluorescence signals. Our immunofluorescence evidence was supported by ultrastructural data, which clearly confirmed that SNAP-25 was undetectable in GABAergic terminals identified by both their typical morphology and specific staining for GABA. Interestingly, our ultrastructural results confirmed that a subset of glutamatergic synapses do not contain detectable levels of SNAP-25. The present study extends our previous findings obtained in rodent hippocampus and provides evidence that SNAP-25 expression is highly variable between different axon terminals both in rat and human brain. The heterogeneous distribution of SNAP-25 may have important implications not only in relation to the function of the protein as a SNARE but also in the control of network excitability."

Inadequate data in this area can lead to severe underestimation of the spatial specificity of the BOLD response. We took thick sections of Indian ink injected human brain and, using confocal laser microscopy and a novel three-dimensional computer-assisted method we extracted and analyzed hundreds of thousands of vascular segments within a large area of cortex. From this database the global densities, the statistical distributions of diameters and lengths were analysed, separating the tree-like and the net-like parts of the microcirculation. Furthermore, our analysis included variations in volume density along the cortical depth and along vectors parallel to the cortical surface. These morphometric parameters are all key requirements for a sound model of cerebral microcirculation."

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified 75 men having prostate cancer with favorable initial biopsy characteristics; 30 developed an unfavorable biopsy (Gleason grade >6, >2 cores with cancer, >50% of a core with cancer, or a palpable nodule) requiring treatment and 45 maintained favorable biopsies throughout a median follow-up of 2.7 years. Demographic, clinical data and quantitative tissue histomorphometry determined by digital image analysis were analyzed. RESULTS: Logistic regression (LR) modeling generated a quantitative nuclear grade (QNG) signature based on the enrollment biopsy for differentiation of Favorable and Unfavorable groups using a variable LR selection criteria of P(z)<0.05. The QNG signature utilized 12 nuclear morphometric descriptors (NMDs) and had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 87% with a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 70% and accuracy of 75%. A multivariable LR model combining QNG signature with clinical and pathological variables yielded an AUC-ROC of 88% and a sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 78% and accuracy of 79%. A LR model using prostate volume, PSA density, and number of pre-diagnosis biopsies resulted in an AUC-ROC of 68% and a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 37% and accuracy of 56%. CONCLUSIONS: QNG using EM prostate biopsies improves the predictive accuracy of LR models based on traditional clinicopathologic variables in determining which patients will ultimately develop an unfavorable biopsy. Our QNG-based model must be rigorously, prospectively validated prior to use in the clinical arena."

We analyzed post surfaces by atomic force microscopy, recording average roughness (R(a)) measurements of fibers and resin matrix. A confocal image profiler allowed for the quantitative assessment of the average superficial roughness (R(a)). Hydrofluoric acid, potassium permanganate, sodium ethoxide, and sandblasting increased post surface roughness. Modifications of the epoxy resin matrix occurred after the surface pre-treatments. Hydrofluoric acid affected the superficial texture of quartz fibers. Surface-conditioning procedures that selectively react with the epoxy-resin matrix of the fiber post enhance roughness and improve the surface area available for adhesion by creating micro-retentive spaces without affecting the post's inner structure."

Survivin, presumably an antiapoptotic protein, was previously proposed as a prognostic marker for urothelial carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess interobserver variability by 2004 World Health Organization classification and the value of survivin and Ki-67 as potential markers for grading noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. DESIGN: Fifty-one bladder biopsies were graded blindly by 5 experienced general surgical pathologists. The protein and messenger RNA expression of survivin and Ki-67 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using paraffin-embedded tissue. The immunohistochemistry result was quantitatively analyzed using a computer-based color deconvolution module. RESULTS: The diagnostic agreement among 5 pathologists was fair to poor, with 32% of the cases graded differently by at least 2 raters. All cases were divided into 3 groups: consensus low-grade, consensus high-grade, and indeterminate. The percentage of urothelial cells with positive survivin nuclear staining (survivin score) was significantly higher in the high-grade than in the low-grade group (P < .001). Survivin score outperformed Ki-67 in separating the high-grade group from the low-grade group and showed a significantly higher predictive accuracy for high-grade recurrence than the histologic grade. The disagreement of grading for the indeterminate group could be resolved by their survivin scores in most cases. Survivin messenger RNA level correlated well with survivin score by immunohistochemistry but was not a more discriminating marker. CONCLUSIONS: Significant interobserver variability exists in grading low-grade versus high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma. Survivin immunohistochemical staining can be a useful adjunct tool for the grading of challenging cases."

In this retrospective study, we report clinical features at onset, imaging characteristics and subsequent course in a group of 34 adult patients with either histologically proven or clinico-radiologically diagnosed brainstem gliomas followed at two centers in Northern Italy. Of the patients 18 were male, 14 female, with a median age of 31. In 21 of the patients histology was obtained and in 20 it was informative (2 pilocytic astrocytoma, 9 low-grade astrocytoma, 8 anaplastic astrocytoma and 1 glioblastoma). Contrast enhancement at MRI was present in 14 patients. In all of the 9 patients who were investigated with MR spectroscopy, the Cho/NAA ratio was elevated at diagnosis. In 8 of the patients, an initial watch and wait policy was adopted, while 24 were treated shortly after diagnosis with either radiotherapy alone [4] or radiotherapy and chemotherapy [20] (mostly temozolomide). Only minor radiological responses were observed after treatments; in a significant proportion of patients (9 out of 15) clinical improvement during therapy occurred in the context of radiologically (MRI) stable disease. Grade III or IV myelotoxicity was observed in 6 patients. After a follow-up ranging from 9 to 180 months, all but 2 patients have progressed and 14 have died (12 for disease progression, 2 for pulmonary embolism). Median overall survival time was of 59 months. Investigation of putative prognostically relevant parameters showed that a short time between disease onset and diagnosis was related to a shorter survival. Compared with literature data, our study confirms the clinical and radiological heterogeneity of adult brainstem gliomas and underscores the need for multicenter trials in order to assess the efficacy of treatments in these tumors."

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 794 human brain astrocytomas were studied between January 1976 and June 2005. The presence of 50 histologic features was rated in 4 categories from 0 (not present) to 3 (abundant) by visual inspection of the sections under a microscope. All tumors were also classified with the corresponding WHO grade between I and IV. We tested the prediction performance of several statistical classification tools (learning vector quantization [LVQ], supervised relevance neural gas [SRNG], support vector machines [SVM], and generalized regression neural network [GRNN]) for this data set. RESULTS: The WHO grade was predicted correctly from histologic features in close to 80% of the cases by 2 modern classifiers (SRNG and SVM), and GRADO-IGL was predicted correctly in > 84% of the cases by a GRNN. CONCLUSION: A standardized report, based the 50 histologic features, can be used in conjunction with modern classification tools as an objective and reproducible method for histologic grading of astrocytomas."

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes required for extracellular matrix degradation in a variety of physiological and pathologic processes including wound healing, embryogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastases. We studied the correlation between expression of MMPs, nucleolar diameter of melanoma cells, different clinical and histologic parameters, and patient's outcome. Seventeen cases of sinonasal and oral malignant melanoma were studied. The expression of MMP2, MMP9, MMP13, and MMP14 was assessed immunohistochemically on paraffinized sections and measured by computer morphometry as well as silver-stained nucleolar diameter. A significant correlation was found between MMP2 and MMP14 expression and patient's outcome. Greater overall survival was seen in patients with average MMP2 expression less than 8000 microm(2)/x20 high-power field (P = .016). In patients with negative MMP14 staining, survival rate by the end of the follow-up was 38% compared with patients with positive MMP14 staining where survival rate was 0 (P = .03). A correlation with age at onset was also found; patients younger than 66 years had better overall survival rates than patients aged 66 years or older (P = .03). The maximal nucleolar diameter (MaxND) was another parameter that significantly correlated with clinical outcome. Patients with MaxND of 8 microm or larger showed a significant worse prognosis compared with the group with MaxND less than 8 microm (P = .0009). Our pilot study demonstrates that MMP2, MMP14, MMP9, and MaxND might be used as prognostic markers in patients with sinonasal and oral malignant melanoma."

Analysis of the mean area fraction of collagen showed that there were significant increases in the collagen fraction for all HGF types compared with control subjects (P < .05). There were significant increases in the number of fibroblasts for HGFa and HGFb compared with control subjects (P < .05). The number of fibroblasts for HGFc were similar to that for control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The collagen fraction was significantly greater in all HGF types compared with controls. The number of fibroblasts was significantly increased in 2 of the 3 HGF types compared with controls. These data indicate that different mechanisms may be responsible for tissue enlargement in different forms of HGF.

Here, we present a 7A resolution structure of DNA-PKcs determined by cryo-electron microscopy single-particle reconstruction. This structure is composed of density rods throughout the molecule that are indicative of alpha helices and reveals structural features not observed in lower resolution EM structures. Docking of homology models into the DNA-PKcs structure demonstrates that up to eight helical HEAT repeat motifs fit well within the density. Surprisingly, models for the kinase domain can be docked into either the crown or base of the molecule at this resolution, although real space refinement suggests that the base location is the best fit. We propose a model for the interaction of DNA with DNA-PKcs in which one turn of dsDNA enters the central channel and interacts with a resolved alpha-helical protrusion."

Eighteen adolescent beagles were divided equally into 6 groups. A critical-size defect of 6 x 2 cm traversed the sagittal suture. The biomaterials used for calvarial reconstruction were demineralized perforated bone matrix (DBM), recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2), and autogenous platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The struts used were cobalt chrome (metal) or resorbable plate. The groupings were as follows: 1) DBM + metal, 2) DBM + PRP + metal, 3) DBM + PRP + resorbable plate, 4) DBM + rhBMP2 + metal, 5) DBM + rhBMP2 + PRP + metal, and 6) DBM + rhBMP2 + resorbable plate. Animals were killed at 3 months after surgery. There was no mortality or major complications. Analysis was performed macroscopically and histologically and with computed tomography. There was complete bony regeneration in the rhBMP2 groups only. Non-rhBMP2 groups had minimal bony ingrowth from the defect edges and on the dural surface, a finding confirmed by computed tomographic scan and histology. Platelet-rich plasma did not enhance bone regeneration. Shape conformation was good with both metal and resorbable plate. rhBMP2, but not PRP, accelerated calvarial regeneration in 3 months. The DBMs in the rhBMP2 groups were substituted by new trabecular bone. Shape molding was good with both metal and resorbable plate."

Kv2.1 is expressed at high levels in the mammalian brain and is a major component of the delayed rectifier current in the hippocampus. In addition, Kv2.1 channels have been implicated in the regulation of membrane repolarization, cytoplasmic calcium levels, and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. They are therefore an important drug target for the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus. We used electron microscopy and single particle image analysis to derive a three-dimensional density map of recombinant human Kv2.1. The tetrameric channel is egg-shaped with a diameter of approximately 80 A and a long axis of approximately 120 A. Comparison to known crystal structures of homologous domains allowed us to infer the location of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane assemblies. There is a very good fit of the Kv1.2 crystal structure to the assigned transmembrane assembly of Kv2.1. In other low-resolution maps of K+ channels, the cytoplasmic N-terminal and transmembrane domains form separate rings of density. In contrast, Kv2.1 displays contiguous density that connects the rings, such that there are no large windows between the channel interior and the cytoplasmic space. The crystal structure of KcsA is thought to be in a closed conformation, and the good fit of the KcsA crystal structure to the Kv2.1 map suggests that our preparations of Kv2.1 may also represent a closed conformation. Substantial cytoplasmic density is closely associated with the T1 tetramerization domain and is ascribed to the approximately 184 kDa C-terminal regulatory domains within each tetramer."

METHODS: Coronary segments (n=98) were harvested from the heart of 34 patients who died without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease. The segments with remodeling were assessed by IVUS and compared with corresponding OCT and histological images. RESULTS: The fibrofatty plaque area was larger in lesions with expansive remodeling (ER) than in lesions with intermediate/constrictive remodeling (IR/CR) (p<0.01). Incidence of lipid containing plaque with the thickness of the fibrous cap smaller than 200 microm tended to be higher in ER than in IR/CR (34% versus 13%, p=0.10). OCT assessment of lipid containing plaque with thinner fibrous cap was achieved with 92% sensitivity and 75% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The fibrofatty plaque area was larger in lesions with ER than IR/CR even in patients without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease. The current capabilities of OCT are well suited for evaluation of lipid containing plaques with thinner fibrous cap."

Pioglitazone has antiatherogenic property through the inhibition of inflammation. Thus, we hypothesized that pioglitazone might inhibit the early inflammatory response, resulting in reduced neointimal hyperplasia in porcine coronary stenting model. Pioglitazone (5mg/kg/day) or placebo was administered orally to 10 pigs (20 coronaries) in each, from 7 days before stenting until the time of euthanasia at 3 or 28 days after stenting. The coronary artery of the pigs was injured with an oversized bare metal stent. Early inflammatory cell infiltration on the vessel surface was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and was significantly suppressed in pioglitazone-treated group comparing with the control (% of site occurring greater infiltration: 40.8% versus 60.9%; P=0.002). Immunohistochemistry revealed that activated NF-kappaB and MCP-1 expression in the vessel was of significantly less in the pioglitazone-treated group. On day 28, morphometric assessment of stent-section showed significant reduction of neointimal thickness in the pioglitazone-treated group comparing with the control (neointimal thickness: 386.5+/-78.2mm versus 591.7+/-238.6mm; P=0.0051), whereas there was no difference in the injury score between two groups. Pioglitazone inhibited neointimal hyperplasia after stenting through a reduction of early inflammatory response."

METHODS: We studied 19 patients with AD and 19 age-matched control subjects who underwent MRI using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTT of the UF was generated. The mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the core of the tract were measured after voxelized tract shape processing. Student's t-test was used to compare results between patients with AD and controls. Intraobserver correlation tests were also performed. RESULTS: FA was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in the UF of patients with AD than of controls. There was no significant difference in MD along the UF between the two groups. Intraobserver reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) for the first and second measurement was r > 0.93 for measured FA and r > 0.92 for measured MD. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that FA reflects progression of AD-related histopathological changes in the UF of the white matter and may represent a useful biological index in monitoring AD. Diffusion tensor tract-specific analysis with voxelized tract shape processing to measure the core of the tract may be a sensitive tool for evaluation of diffusion abnormalities of white matter tracts in AD.

However, to date studies have not examined whether age- and sex-matched unmedicated schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) patients share some or all of the structural brain-imaging characteristics of schizophrenia patients. We examined cortical gray/white matter volumes in a large sample of unmedicated schizophrenia-spectrum patients (n=79 SPD, n=57 schizophrenia) and 148 healthy controls. MRI images were reoriented to standard position parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure line, segmented into gray and white matter tissue types, and assigned to Brodmann areas (BAs) using a postmortem-histological atlas. Group differences in regional volume of gray and white matter in the BAs were examined with MANOVA. Schizophrenia patients had significantly reduced gray matter volume widely across the cortex but more marked in frontal and temporal lobes. SPD patients had reductions in the same regions but only about half that observed in schizophrenia and sparing in key regions including BA10. In schizophrenia, greater fronto-temporal volume loss was associated with greater negative symptom severity and in SPD, greater interpersonal and cognitive impairment. Overall, our findings suggest that increased prefrontal volume in BA10 and sparing of volume loss in temporal cortex (BAs 22 and 20) may be a protective factor in SPD which reduces vulnerability to psychosis."

STUDY DESIGN: A sample of 39 temporomandibular joints TMJs (31 case specimens, 8 control specimens) from 28 patients (mean age 31.2 years) were recruited for this study. The patients were considered to be affected and treated surgically with disc repositioning when presenting painful clinical signs of disc displacement after unsuccessful nonsurgical treatment for at least 6 months. Of the control patients, 4 presented condyle fracture which required opening to be reduced for treatment, and 4 displayed active condyle hyperplasia. The posterior region of the disc was removed and sent for histologic and histomorphometric analysis. Histologic (hematoxylin-eosin) and histomorphometric (picro-Sirius red) analyses were performed. Statistically significant differences between the analyzed groups were accessed through the chi-squared test (P <or= .05). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to observe the differences between mean values when variables did not present normal distribution [Kolmogorov-Smirnov(a) test]. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in relation to the parameters studied by histologic and histomorphometric analysis (using or not using polarization). CONCLUSIONS: To the limits of this study, there were no significant histologic and histomorphometric differences in the articular disc between groups with and without TMJ dysfunction."

RESULTS: The nuclei in CGCLs were more numerous, larger, and more irregular than those in PGCLs. Furthermore, CD68 expression and the ratio of CD68(+) macrophage to MGCs were significantly greater in CGCLs than in PGCLs. Statistical correlations between CD68 expression and the staining-intensity distribution score within the diagnostic groups were significant in CGCLs and not significant in PGCLs. CONCLUSION: Although the CGCLs share some histopathologic similarities with PGCLs, differences in both nuclear morphometric parameters of MGC and CD68 immunoreactivity may underlie the distinct clinical behavior."

Superimposed AFB clusters, extreme stain variation and low depth of field were challenges. Our novel method facilitates electronic diagnosis of TB, permitting wider application in developing countries where fluorescent microscopy is currently inaccessible and unaffordable. We plan refinement and validation in the future."

As these treatment options do not provide tissue for histopathologic examination, in vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy may become an important method for obtaining a reliable diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to validate the diagnostic confocal examination of actinic keratoses. METHODS: Thirty actinic keratoses and skin fields from the contralateral sides of the patients were consecutively sampled and examined using a confocal microscope. Stored images were rated by four independent observers. RESULTS: Distinct diagnostic morphologic features could be visualized. Overall, sensitivity of 93.34% and specificity of 88.34% could be achieved by two clinical dermatooncologists (positive predictive value 88.94%, negative predictive value 93.15%). Assessment of distinct confocal microscopy features showed a moderate interobserver correlation (kappa= 0.4-0.6 in five of seven criteria). Classification and regression tree analysis yielded a one-step algorithm based on only one criterion (irregular keratinocyte cell borders), facilitating a correct classification in 86.67% of actinic keratoses and 85% of normal skin. LIMITATIONS: Hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses were excluded from the study set. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a set of morphologic confocal microscopy criteria showing promise as a noninvasive monitoring tool in the treatment of actinic keratoses."

MATERIAL/METHODS: A morphometric analysis was performed on histological sections of 52 primary BCCs which recurred and of 52 cases of BCC which did not recur. Eighteen different morphometric parameters were considered, e.g. nuclear area, perimeter, elongation, convexivity, and gray level of the nucleus. The demographics of these patients and the histological-morphological characteristics of their tumors were also considered. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the morphometric variables for the recurrence of BCCs. RESULTS: Increased patient age, multiple localization of BCCs at the time of diagnosis, and a low degree of peripheral palisading at the histological sections of BCCs were associated with BCC recurrence and consequently worse disease-free survival (DFS). 'Darker' values of the maximum nuclear gray level as well as greater variance of nuclear gray level values also strongly related to BCC recurrence and worse DFS. The analysis of the morphometry according to the histological types of BCC revealed that nodular BCCs consist of larger cells with statistically significant increased perimeter, minimum exterior axis, nuclear area, surface and perimeter of convexivity, and equivalent circle diameter. Infiltrating, sclerosing, and superficial BCCs, which tend to relapse, showed to consist of smaller cells with greater intercellular distance. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear morphometry evaluated with computer-assisted image analysis may contribute to a better knowledge and outcome prediction of BCC."

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the role of IVCM in the assessment of various types of polyneuropathy, and to define alterations of corneal nerves in such conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with various types of polyneuropathy were characterized by clinical neurological and ophthalmic examinations, as well as by electroneuromyography (ENMG). Full thickness IVCM of corneal nerves was carried out on all patients and 15 age-matched eyes using Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II (HRT II). The subbasal nerve plexus were statistically analysed regarding long nerve fiber density, nerve branch density, nerve thickness, nerve bead number and nerve tortuosity. RESULTS: In subbasal nerve plexus, the following three parameters were significantly reduced in patients with polyneuropathy compared to controls: long nerve fibre density (p < 0.01), nerve branch density (p < 0.001), and nerve bead number (p = 0.001). In addition, the average grade of nerve tortuosity was 2.87 +/- 0.97 in the polyneuropathic group and 1.17 +/- 0.68 in the control group (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: IVCM allows a non-invasive, in vivo study of corneal nerves with high resolution. It therefore appears invaluable in clinical investigations. IVCM appears to be valuable in a large variety of polyneuropathic conditions."

Moreover, when excited by a laser, defect centres within the nanodiamond emit photons that are capable of penetrating tissue, making them well suited for biological imaging applications. Here, we show that bright fluorescent nanodiamonds can be produced in large quantities by irradiating synthetic diamond nanocrystallites with helium ions. The fluorescence is sufficiently bright and stable to allow three-dimensional tracking of a single particle within the cell by means of either one- or two-photon-excited fluorescence microscopy. The excellent photophysical characteristics are maintained for particles as small as 25 nm, suggesting that fluorescent nanodiamond is an ideal probe for long-term tracking and imaging in vivo, with good temporal and spatial resolution."

A TCFA has a trombogenic soft lipid core, shielded from the blood stream by a thin, possibly inflamed, stiff cap. The majority of atherosclerotic plaques resemble a TCFA in terms of overall structural composition, but have a more complex, heterogeneous morphology. An assessment of the material distribution is vital for quantifying the plaque's mechanical stability and for determining the effect of plaque-stabilizing pharmaceutical agents. We describe a new automated inverse elasticity method, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) modulography, which is capable of reconstructing a heterogeneous Young's modulus distribution. The elastogram (i.e., spatial strain distribution) of the plaque is the input for the method, and is measured using the clinically available technique, IVUS elastography. Our method incorporates a novel divide-and-conquer strategy, allowing the reconstruction of TCFAs as well as heterogeneous plaques with localized regions of soft, weakened tissue. The method was applied to ex vivo elastograms, which were simulated from the cross sections of postmortem human coronary plaques. To demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the method, measured elastograms from human atherosclerotic coronary arteries were analyzed. One elastogram was measured in vitro; the other, in vivo. The method approximated the true Young's modulus distribution of all simulated plaques, while the in vitro reconstruction was in agreement with histology. In conclusion, the IVUS modulography in combination with the IVUS elastography has strong potential to become an all-encompassing modality for detecting plaques, for assessing the information related to their rupture-proneness, and for imaging their heterogeneous elastic material composition."

However, there is very little information available regarding right ventricular false tendons (RFTs). The aim of our study, therefore, was to explore and delineate the morphology, topography and morphometry of the RFTs, and provide a comprehensive picture of their anatomy across a broad range of specimens. We identified 35/100 heart specimens containing right ventricular RFTs and classified them into five types. In Type I (21, 47.7%) the RFTs, was located between the ventricular septum and the anterior papillary muscle; in Type II (11, 22.9%) between ventricular septum and the posterior papillary muscle; in Type III (7, 14.5%) between the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the right ventricular free wall; in Type IV (5, 10.4%) between the posterior papillary muscle and the ventricular free wall; and lastly, in Type V (4, 8.3%) between the anterior papillary muscle and ventricular free wall. The mean length of the RFTs was 18 +/- 7 mm with a mean diameter of 1.4 +/- 05 mm. Histologic examination with Masson trichrome and PAS revealed that 20 (41.6%) of the 48 RFTs carried conduction tissue fibers. The presence of conduction tissue fibers within the RFTs was limited to Types I, III, and IV. In Types II and V the RFTs resembled fibrous structures in contrast with Type I, II and IV, which were composed more of muscular fibers, including conduction tissue fibers. RFTs containing conduction tissue fibers were identified, which may implicate them in the appearance of arrhythmias."

A so-called synovitis score has been introduced as a standardised grading system, based on the semi-quantitative evaluation of the three determining features of chronic synovitis: enlargement of synovial lining, density of synovial stroma and inflammatory infiltrate, giving a score between 0 and 9. The present study examines the reliability of this procedure by comparison with exact measurements using computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA). Seventy-one synovial specimens from patients with osteoarthritis (OA, n=22), psoriatic arthritis (PsA, n=7), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=35) and from a control group (Co, n=7) were evaluated using both the synovitis score and CAIA. The measurements were transformed to semi-quantitative values analogous to the synovitis score. The differences between the transformed CAIA scores and the pathologist's scores were 0 or +/-1 in 40 cases, whereas in 31 cases the difference was greater than 1 (correlation coefficient r=0.725). The CAIA scores differed significantly between Co and RA cases (p=0.000) as well as between OA and RA (p=0.000). We conclude that the synovitis score was validated by CAIA and can be regarded a reliable grading system that contributes to the diagnostic procedure of chronic joint inflammation."

Epub 2008 May 1.,Yu F,Comput Biol Med,2008,2008/05/06,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2008.02.004,"This paper presents a novel two-dimensional (2-D) stochastic method for semantic analysis of the content of histological images Specifically, we propose a 2-D generalization of the traditional hidden Markov model (HMM). The generalization is called spatial-hidden Markov model (SHMM) that captures the contextual characteristics of complex biological features in histological images The model employs a second-order neighborhood system and assumes the conditional independence of vertical and horizontal transitions between hidden states. The notion of 'past' in SHMM is defined as what have been observed in a row-wise raster scan. This paper focuses on two fundamental problems: the best states decoding problem and the estimation of generation probability of an image by a SHMM. Based on our independence assumption of horizontal and vertical transitions, we derive computational tractable solutions to those problems. These solutions are direct extensions of their counterparts, i.e., the Viterbi algorithm and Forward-Backward algorithm, for 1-D HMM. Our experiments were carried on a medical image database with 200 images and compared with a state-of-the-art approach that was run on the same database. The annotation results demonstrated that SHMM consistently outperforms the previous approach and ameliorates many of its drawbacks. In addition, performance comparison with HMM has also validated the superiority of SHMM."
18504755,Comparison of lipid-rich necrotic core size in symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaque: Initial results,"Cappendijk VC, Kessels AG, Heeneman S, Cleutjens KB, Schurink GW, Welten RJ, Mess WH, van Suylen RJ, Leiner T, Daemen MJ, van Engelshoven JM, Kooi ME.",J Magn Reson Imaging. 2008 Jun;27(6):1356-61. doi: 10.1002/jmri.21359.,Cappendijk VC,J Magn Reson Imaging,2008,2008/05/28,,,10.1002/jmri.21359,"PURPOSE: To investigate the potential difference in the size of the lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC) in carotid plaques of symptomatic patients versus asymptomatic patients. Pathological studies established that a large LRNC is an important feature of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Previously, we have demonstrated a high correlation between semiquantitative analysis of the LRNC size in T1-weighted (w) turbo field echo (TFE) MR images and histology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with carotid stenosis >70% with (n = 26) or without (n = 11) symptoms were included. Three independent MR readers quantified the amount of LRNC with a T1w TFE pulse sequence. The relative amount of LRNC (LRNC score) was defined as sum of cross-sectional area percentages LRNC per carotid plaque. RESULTS: Interreader agreement for the three MR readers was good, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 0.72 (0.57-0.83). All three MR readers on average found a larger LRNC in the symptomatic group of patients, although this was not statistically significant. The mean LRNC score was 116 +/- 129 and 59 +/- 62 for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively (P = 0.13). Symptomatic patients showed wide ranges in LRNC scores (0-424), while the range was much lower in the asymptomatic group (0-170). CONCLUSION: Single-sequence T1w TFE may be a promising technique to study atherosclerotic plaque at risk of stroke. Larger studies are warranted to confirm these promising results."

However, the nuclear irregularities in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have not yet been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinicopathologic significance of nuclear grooves and inclusions in RCC. DESIGN: The frequencies or scores of nuclear grooves and inclusions were compared with the histologic subtype, nuclear grade, and TNM stage, as well as overall survival of RCC patients. For objective counting of nuclear irregularities, a relational image database was constructed and used for quantitative assessment. RESULTS: Nuclear grooves and inclusions were seen in 96% and 65% of 110 RCC cases, respectively. The intranuclear inclusions were found more frequently in chromophobe and papillary types than in clear cell carcinoma (P < .001). The nuclear scores, the sum of grooves or inclusions per 5000 tumor cells, were highly related to the histologic subtype (P < .001). Clear cell RCCs with high inclusion scores (2 or more) were correlated with poorer overall survival in comparison to clear cell carcinomas with low inclusion scores (P = .04). The groove scores were highly associated with Fuhrman grade (P = .003) but not with overall survival of clear cell RCC patients (P = .65). In multivariate analysis, higher inclusion scores and advanced tumor stages (III/IV) were correlated with worse outcomes of clear cell RCC. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear grooves and inclusions are histologic components of RCCs, especially chromophobe and papillary carcinomas. Furthermore, nuclear inclusions might be an independent prognostic factor for clear cell RCC."

With epi-THG intensities 20 times stronger than corresponding fluorescence intensities from the same LEQDs under the same conditions of energy absorption, such high brightness LEQDs were proved for the abilities of cell tracking and detection of specific molecular expression in live cancer cells. Using nude mice as an animal model, the distribution of LEQD-loaded tumor cells deep in subcutaneous tissues were imaged with high THG contrast. This is the first demonstration that THG contrast can be manipulated in vivo with nanoparticles. By linking LEQDs with anti-Her2 antibodies, the expression of Her2/neu receptors in live breast cancer cells could also be easily detected through THG. Compared with fluorescence modalities, the THG modality also provides the advantage of no photobleaching and photoblinkin g effects. Combined with a high penetration 1230 nm laser, these novel features make LEQDs excellent THG contrast agents for in vivo deep-tissue imaging in the future."

METHODS: Seventeen consecutive patients with 23 morphologically abnormal ovarian masses (solid or cystic with papillary excrescences, focally thickened walls, or irregular solid areas) smaller than 10 cm received a microbubble contrast agent intravenously while undergoing pulse inversion harmonic transvaginal sonography. The following parameters were assessed in all tumors: detectable contrast enhancement, time to peak enhancement (wash-in), peak contrast enhancement, half wash-out time, and area under the enhancement curve. Tumor histologic analysis was used to distinguish benign from malignant ovarian tumors. RESULTS: Fourteen benign masses and 9 malignancies were studied. There was a statistically significant difference in the peak enhancement (mean +/- SD, 23.3 +/- 2.8 versus 12.3 +/- 3.9 dB; P < .01), half wash-out time (139.9 +/- 43.6 versus 46.3 +/- 19.7 seconds; P < .01), and area under the enhancement curve (2012.9 +/- 532.9 versus 523.9 +/- 318 seconds(-1); P < .01) in malignant masses compared with benign disease. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to peak enhancement (26.1 +/- 6.3 versus 24.9 +/- 7.6 seconds; P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data showed a significant difference in the contrast enhancement kinetic parameters between benign and malignant ovarian masses."

METHODS: Sixty patients were enrolled. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the central and peripheral zones (CZ and PZ, respectively) of the prostate were evaluated on T2- and T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before and 24 hours after USPIO-enhanced MRI. The changes in SNR after USPIO-enhanced MRI were analyzed and correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen and histopathologic Gleason scoring based on surgically removed prostate gland. RESULTS: Decrease in SNR was noted in each zone of the prostate after USPIO-enhanced MRI (P < 0.001). Mean SNR decrease in the CZ was higher than that in the PZ (P < 0.05). High-grade prostate cancer was associated with a higher decrease in SNR (P < 0.05). The SNR change was negatively correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen at low or intermediate levels (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Enhancement of the prostate gland after USPIO administration may be associated with primary prostate cancer."
18664845,Is the computer-aided detection scheme for lung nodule also useful in detecting lung cancer?,"Goo JM, Kim HY, Lee JW, Lee HJ, Lee CH, Lee KW, Kim TJ, Lim KY, Park SH, Bae KT.",J Comput Assist Tomogr. 2008 Jul-Aug;32(4):570-5. doi: 10.1097/RCT.0b013e318146261c.,Goo JM,J Comput Assist Tomogr,2008,2008/07/31,,,10.1097/RCT.0b013e318146261c,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system on the performance of observers for the detection of both lung nodules and lung cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty computed tomographic scans were evaluated. Database included 23 lung cancers (long diameter <20 mm), nodules stable for at least 2 years, and normal cases. Five chest radiologists and 5 radiology residents each independently recorded the locus of each nodule candidate and assigned a confidence score for the likelihood of nodule and malignancy without CAD; then, the interpretation was repeated with the use of CAD. A consensus panel of 2 chest radiologists served as a reference standard for the nodules. Histological confirmation was a reference standard for the cancers. The performances of the observers for the detection of nodules and cancer with and without CAD were compared using jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The performance of detecting lung nodules was increased significantly with CAD for all radiologists and subgroups (P < 0.01). Although the overall performance of detecting lung cancers was not affected significantly with the use of CAD (P > 0.05), 4 lung cancers missed by 3 residents on their initial observation were additionally detected with CAD. Eighteen of 23 lung cancers were detected by CAD itself. CONCLUSIONS: The overall radiologists' performance of detecting lung nodules was improved significantly with the use of CAD, whereas no statistical significance was observed for the detection of lung cancers. The use of CAD, however, contributed to the detection of additional lung cancers for less experienced readers."

Epub 2008 Jun 26.,Lima R,J Biomech,2008,2008/07/01,,,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.04.033,"The flow properties of blood in the microcirculation depend strongly on the hematocrit (Hct), microvessel geometry, and cell properties. Previous in vitro studies have measured the radial displacement of red blood cells (RBCs) at concentrated suspensions using conventional microscopes. However, to measure the RBCs motion they used transparent suspensions of ghost red cells, which may have different physical properties than normal RBCs. The present study introduces a new approach (confocal micro-PTV) to measure the motion of labeled RBCs flowing in concentrated suspensions of normal RBCs. The ability of confocal systems to obtain thin in-focus planes allowed us to measure the radial position of individual RBCs accurately and to consequently measure the interaction between multiple labeled RBCs. All the measurements were performed in the center plane of both 50 and 100 microm glass capillaries at Reynolds numbers (Re) from 0.003 to 0.005 using Hcts from 2% to 35%. To quantify the motion and interaction of multiple RBCs, we used the RBC radial dispersion (D(yy)). Our results clearly demonstrate that D(yy) strongly depends on the Hct. The RBCs exhibited higher D(yy) at radial positions between 0.4 and 0.8R and lower D(yy) at locations adjacent to the wall (0.8-1R) and around the middle of the capillary (0-0.2R). The present work also demonstrates that D(yy) tends to decrease with a decrease in the diameter. The information provided by this study not only complements previous investigations on microhemorheology of both dilute and concentrated suspensions of RBCs, but also shows the influence of both Hct and geometry on the radial dispersion of RBCs. This information is important for a better understanding of blood mass transport mechanisms under both physiological and pathological conditions."

STUDY DESIGN: Ten hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 6 large regenerative nodules (LRN), and 34 regenerative (cirrhotic) nodules (RN), obtained from cirrhotic explant livers, were analyzed using a Kontron-Zeiss KS400 image analyzer. We generated a morphometric model based on the analysis of volume fractions occupied by hepatocyte nuclei/cytoplasm, sinusoidal endothelium and lumen, neoplastic acini, fibrosis, centrilobular veins, portal arteries, veins and bile ducts, individual lesional arteries (smooth muscle actin), and capillarized sinusoids (CD34), and on surface fraction occupied by reticulin, and number in unit volume and size distribution of hepatocyte nuclei, and mean hepatocyte nucleus diameter and volume. RESULTS: Volume fraction of capillarized sinusoids and of individual lesional arteries were more prominent in HCC and LRNs, when compared with RN, whereas surface fraction of reticulin was markedly decreased in HCC. The morphometric values of these three features were integrated into our classification tool to construct a hybrid system, which reclassified the nodules in the same categories. CONCLUSION: Our novel hybrid classification tool may minimize subjectivity in the histological assessment of nodular lesions in cirrhosis."

Seventeen human teeth (eight avulsed, five severely intruded and four uninjured extracted) were evaluated for the distribution and physical characteristics of adherent root surface PDL. The topographic distribution of PDL was assessed by staining roots with malachite green and determining the proportion of remaining PDL within selected regions on four aspects of each tooth. In order to characterize mechanical damage to PDL, serial transverse sections of roots were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined at magnifications of 40x to 800x. The sections were photographed and imaging software was used to calculate the percentage of remaining PDL in the circumference of each root section. Topographic analysis demonstrated that 54% of the PDL remained on roots of avulsed and severely intruded incisors and 36% of the PDL remained on the extracted single-rooted premolars. Examination of serial transverse root sections revealed that 58% of the PDL remained on roots of avulsed or severely intruded incisors and 54% on extracted premolars. Avulsed and severely intruded incisors demonstrated similar amounts of retained PDL. In both injuries, almost half of the root surface was denuded of PDL."

METHODS: A total of 857 CLSM tumour images including 408 benign nevi and 449 melanoma images was evaluated. Image analysis was based on features of the wavelet transform. For classification purposes we used a classification tree software (CART). Moreover, automated image analysis results were compared with the prediction success of an independent human observer. RESULTS: CART analysis of the whole set of CLSM tumour images correctly classified 97.55% and 96.32% of melanoma and nevi images. In contrast, sensitivity and specificity of 85.52% and 80.15% could be reached by the human observer. When the image set was randomly divided into a learning (67% of the images) and a test set (33% of the images), overall 97.31% and 81.03% of the tumour images in the learning and test set could be classified correctly by the CART procedure. CONCLUSION: Provided automated decisions can be used as a second opinion. This can be valuable in assisting diagnostic decisions in this new and exciting imaging technique."

The aim of this study was to determine acinar and ductal dimensions, the number of striated ducts and the proportion of fat tissue in patients with and without alcoholic parotid sialosis. METHODS: Twelve parotid biopsy samples from patients with hepatic alcoholic cirrhosis and those from seven controls were used. A morphometrical study with a digital image analyser attached to an optical microscope was carried out. Direct and indirect indicators from acinar and ductal dimensions were recorded. The number of striated ducts and the proportion of fat tissue in stroma were determined. Fifteen records for each variable were taken. Mean values were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test (P <or= 0.05). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in acinar and ductal dimensions and the number of striated ducts between alcoholic and control patients. The proportion of fat tissue in alcoholic parotides was significantly lower than that in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not corroborate previous qualitative descriptions about acinar and ductal hypertrophy and ductal hyperplasy in alcoholic patients. The main cause of parotid enlargement could not be stromal fat infiltration. The data could be used for differential diagnoses of sialosis."

We aimed to study the diagnostic performance of LSM for histologic bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in various chronic liver diseases and to investigate the effects of liver fibrosis distribution on LSM. METHODS: We prospectively studied consecutive patients with chronic liver diseases undergoing liver biopsy and transient elastography examinations. Morphometric analysis was performed to evaluate the distribution of liver fibrosis. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three patients (50% chronic hepatitis B, 14% chronic hepatitis C, and 24% nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) were studied. Morphometric analysis revealed a higher correlation between LSM and pericellular fibrosis (r = 0.43) than periportal (r = 0.21) or perivenular fibrosis (r = 0.25). Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of LSM for bridging fibrosis was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.93) and for cirrhosis was 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.94). Higher LSM was associated with higher serum ALT level. Patients with the same fibrosis staging but higher ALT levels tend to have higher LSM. The area under ROC curve of LSM for cirrhosis was lower among patients who had ALT above the upper limit of normal (0.86) as compared with that of patients with normal ALT levels (0.93, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Transient elastography can diagnose severe fibrosis because of its good correlation with pericellular fibrosis. Transient elastography might overestimate liver fibrosis when ALT is elevated."

Then, these teeth were treated endodontically and filled with gutta-percha using AH-26 root canal sealer. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 15 teeth in each. The roots were resected perpendicular to its long axis 3 mm from the apex using Er: yttrium-aluminium-garnet (YAG) laser irradiation in groups 1 and 2, and the resected root surfaces were lased with Nd:YAG laser in group 2. The apexes were resected by a high-speed handpiece in groups 3 and 4, and the resected root surfaces were lased with Nd:YAG laser in group 4. Ten teeth in each group were used for leakage studies, and the other five teeth were used for scanning electron microscopic examinations. Seven sections were obtained from each root to assess the microleakage, and the sections were analyzed in a computer-assisted manner. No statistically significant differences were observed between the leakage percentage of groups 1 and 3 and groups 2 and 4 (p>0.05). Morphological differences were observed between apical dentin surfaces resected with conventional techniques and laser beam."

Our hypothesis was that classic and atypical meningiomas have different patterns of intratumoral water diffusion that will allow for differentiation between them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in 12 classic and 12 atypical meningiomas. Signal intensity of solid-enhancing tumor regions on diffusion-weighted trace images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps was assessed. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in solid-enhancing regions, peritumoral edema, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) to measure tensor metrics including major (lambda(1)), intermediate (lambda(2)) and minor eigenvalues (lambda(3)) and FA and ADC values. Distribution of tensor shapes within enhancing tumors was calculated for all tumors. Differences between classic and atypical meningiomas in tumor signal intensity, intratumoral and peritumoral tensor metrics, as well as tensor shapes distribution were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of atypical meningiomas were isointense and hypointense on ADC maps (P = .007). Classic meningiomas had significantly lower FA (P = .012), higher ADC (P = .011), greater lambda(2) (P = .020) and lambda(3) (P = .003). There was significantly more spherical diffusion in classic than in atypical meningiomas (P = .020). All diffusion tensor metrics for peritumoral edema of the 2 tumor groups did not differ. CONCLUSION: DTI showed that intratumoral microscopic water motion is less organized in classic than in atypical meningiomas. This feature may allow for noninvasive differentiation between classic and atypical meningiomas."

These measurements include the spatiotemporal quantification of cell migration, mitosis, apoptosis, and the reconstruction of cell lineages. The combination of low signal-to-noise ratio of phase contrast microscopy images, high and varying densities of the cell cultures, topological complexities of cell shapes, and wide range of cell behaviors poses many challenges to existing tracking techniques. This paper presents a fully automated multi-target tracking system that can efficiently cope with these challenges while simultaneously tracking and analyzing thousands of cells observed using time-lapse phase contrast microscopy. The system combines bottom-up and top-down image analysis by integrating multiple collaborative modules, which exploit a fast geometric active contour tracker in conjunction with adaptive interacting multiple models (IMM) motion filtering and spatiotemporal trajectory optimization.

There is a paucity of information regarding the intrinsic characteristics of the right ventricle in HLHS. We studied extra-cellular matrix composition, myocyte homeostasis and gene expression in right ventricular biopsies obtained from patients with HLHS undergoing neonatal first stage palliation and from patients undergoing neonatal truncus arteriosus repair. METHODS: Tissue was evaluated using histological and real-time PCR techniques using the truncus group as a comparative group. Mean difference in outcomes between the HLHS and truncus groups was estimated using linear regression models in unadjusted and age-adjusted analyses. RESULTS: Markers of cell proliferation, apoptosis and fibronectin were significantly higher in the right ventricular myocardium of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome compared to truncus arteriosus. Type I collagen content and NKX2.5 expression were significantly lower in HLHS than the truncus group. CONCLUSION: The neonatal right ventricle in HLHS demonstrates a number of intrinsic differences compared to the right ventricle in truncus arteriosus including relative immaturity of the extra-cellular matrix, inappropriately low transcription factor expression and increased myocyte apoptosis."

Epub 2008 Sep 15.,Benz MR,J Nucl Med,2008,2008/09/17,PMC4068272,NIHMS586558,10.2967/jnumed.108.053694,"By allowing simultaneous measurements of tumor volume and metabolic activity, integrated PET/CT opens up new approaches for assessing tumor response to therapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether combined assessment of tumor volume and metabolic activity improves the accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET for predicting histopathologic tumor response in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. METHODS: Twenty patients with locally advanced high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma (10 men and 10 women; mean age, 49 +/- 17 y) were studied by (18)F-FDG PET/CT before and after preoperative therapy. CT tumor volume (CTvol) was measured by delineating tumor borders on consecutive slices of the CT scan. Mean and maximum (18)F-FDG standardized uptake value within this volume (SUVmean and SUVmax, respectively) were determined. Two indices of total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were calculated by multiplying tumor volume by SUVmean (TLGmean) and SUVmax (TLGmax). Changes in CTvol, SUVmean, SUVmax, TLGmean, and TLGmax after chemotherapy were correlated with histopathologic tumor response (> or =95% treatment-induced tumor necrosis). Accuracy for predicting histopathologic response was compared by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Baseline SUVmax, SUVmean, CTvol, TLGmean, and TLGmax were 11.22 g/mL, 2.84 g/mL, 544.1 mL, 1,619.8 g, and 8852.9 g, respectively. After neoadjuvant therapy, all parameters except CTvol showed a significant decline (DeltaSUVmax = -51%, P < 0.001; DeltaSUVmean = -40%, P < 0.001; DeltaCTvol = -14%, P = 0.37; DeltaTLGmean = -44%, P = 0.006; and DeltaTLGmax = -54%, P = 0.001). SUV changes in histopathologic responders (n = 6) were significantly more pronounced than those in nonresponders (n = 14) (P = 0.001). Histopathologic response was well predicted by changes in SUVmean and SUVmax (area under ROC curve [AUC] = 1.0 and 0.98, respectively) followed by TLGmean (AUC = 0.77) and TLGmax (AUC = 0.74). In contrast, changes in CTvol did not allow prediction of treatment response (AUC = 0.48). CONCLUSION: In this population of patients with sarcoma, TLG was less accurate in predicting tumor response than were measurements of the intratumoral (18)F-FDG concentration (SUVmax, SUVmean). Further evaluation of TLG in larger patient populations and other tumor types is necessary to determine the value of this conceptually attractive parameter for assessing tumor response."

This technology is enabled by the availability of programmable filters that can be set to transmit light only of particular wavelengths. Spectral imaging technologies have become an important part of microscopy, and are particularly useful for analyzing samples that have been labeled with multiple (two or more) molecular markers. The most commonly used methodology for separating the markers from each other is linear unmixing, which results in a quantitative image of the location and amount of each marker present in the sample. The very complexity of these multilabel samples requires a high degree of sophistication in methods to visualize the results of unmixing. This article describes a wide range of useful visualization tools designed to better enable discrimination of different features in multilabeled tissue or cell samples. These commercially available tools can be attached to the standard laboratory light microscope to significantly enhance the power of light microscopy."

The hard tissues of the human dentition are able to resist decay and degradation long after other tissues are lost. This resistance has made teeth useful indicators for age calculation. Recent research indicates that tooth cementum annulations (TCA) may be used more reliably than any other morphological or histological traits of the adult skeleton for age estimation. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between age and the number of incremental lines in human dental cementum and to ascertain the best method of studying cementum with respect to different forms of microscopy. Thirty nonrestorable teeth were extracted from 20 people, and longitudinal ground section of each tooth was prepared. Photomicrographs of the area at the junction of apical and middle third of the root under light and polarized microscope were taken. The cementum was composed of multiple light and dark bands that were counted on the photomicrograph with the help of image analysis software and added to the average eruption time of individual tooth. The predicted age of the individual was thus obtained. Results showed a significant correlation between the predicted age and actual chronological age of the individual. These data indicate that quantitation of cementum annuli is a moderately reliable means for age estimation in humans and polarizing microscopy is a better means of visualizing incremental lines of cementum compared to light microscopy."

Epub 2008 Feb 27.,Hinds O,Cereb Cortex,2008,2008/03/01,PMC2733317,,10.1093/cercor/bhn016,"Previous studies have reported considerable variability in primary visual cortex (V1) shape in both humans and macaques. Here, we demonstrate that much of this variability is due to the pattern of cortical folds particular to an individual and that V1 shape is similar among individual humans and macaques as well as between these 2 species. Human V1 was imaged ex vivo using high-resolution (200 microm) magnetic resonance imaging at 7 T. Macaque V1 was identified in published histological serial section data. Manual tracings of the stria of Gennari were used to construct a V1 surface, which was computationally flattened with minimal metric distortion of the cortical surface. Accurate flattening allowed investigation of intrinsic geometric features of cortex, which are largely independent of the highly variable cortical folds. The intrinsic shape of V1 was found to be similar across human subjects using both nonparametric boundary matching and a simple elliptical shape model fit to the data and is very close to that of the macaque monkey. This result agrees with predictions derived from current models of V1 topography. In addition, V1 shape similarity suggests that similar developmental mechanisms are responsible for establishing V1 shape in these 2 species."

Only 3% of these neoplasms are located in the head and neck region. Synovial chondromatosis of the temporomandibular joint is therefore a very rare disorder. Therefore, developing a working, histological confirmation is required for differential diagnosis. In this case series, the outcome of histological investigation and imaging techniques are compared. Based on clinical symptoms, five cases of suspected synovial chondromatosis of the temporomandibular joint are presented. In each of the subjects, the diagnosis was confirmed by histology. Specific imaging features for each case are described. The tomography images were compared with the histological findings. All patients demonstrated preauricular swelling, dental midline deviation, and limited mouth opening. Computer-assisted surgery was performed. Histology disclosed synovial chondromatosis of the temporomandibular joint in four cases. The other case was found to be a developmental disorder of the tympanic bone. The diagnosis of synovial chondromatosis of the temporomandibular joint can only be based on histology. Clinical symptoms are too general and the available imaging techniques only show nonspecific tumorous destruction, infiltration, and/or residual calcified bodies, they are only for advanced cases. A rare developmental disorder of the tympanic bone--persistence of foramen of Huschke--has to be differentiated."

Here we use a technique that utilizes digital holography, allowing label-free and completely non-invasive cell counting directly in cell culture vessels with adherent viable cells. The images produced can provide both quantitative and qualitative phase information from a single hologram. The recently constructed microscope Holomonitor (Phase Holographic Imaging AB, Lund, Sweden) combines the commonly used phase contrast microscope with digital holography, the latter giving us the possibility of achieving quantitative information on cellular shape, area, confluence and optical thickness. This project aimed at determining the accuracy and repeatability of cell counting measurements using digital holography compared to the conventional manual cell counting method using a haemocytometer. The collected data were also used to determine cell size and cellular optical thickness. The results show that digital holography can be used for non-invasive automatic cell counting as precisely as conventional manual cell counting."

The signals are cross-correlated to obtain the microscopic tissue displacements, which can be directly translated into local strain of the vessel wall. However, (apparent) tissue motion and nonuniform deformation of the vessel wall, due to catheter wiggling, reduce signal correlation and result in invalid strain estimates. Implications of probe motion were studied on the tissue-mimicking phantom. The measured circumferential tissue displacement and level of the speckle decorrelation amounted to 12 degrees and 0.58, respectively, for the catheter displacement of 456 microm. To compensate for the motion artifacts in IVUS palpography, a novel method based on the feature-based scale-space optical flow (OF), and classical block matching (BM) algorithm, were employed. The computed OF vector and BM displacement fields quantify the amount of local tissue misalignment in consecutive frames. Subsequently, the extracted circumferential displacements are used to realign the signals before strain computation. Motion compensation reduces the RF signal decorrelation and increases the number of valid strain estimates. The advantage of applying the motion correction in IVUS palpography was demonstrated in a midscale validation study on 14 in vivo pullbacks. Both methods substantially increase the number of valid strain estimates in the partial and compounded palpograms. Mean relative improvement in the number of valid strain estimates with motion compensation in comparison to one without motion compensation amounts to 28% and 14%, respectively. Implementation of motion compensation methods boosts the diagnostic value of IVUS palpography."

Epub 2008 Oct 11.,Wolthuis R,Anal Chem,2008,2008/10/14,,,10.1021/ac801191x,"This study aims to develop IR imaging of tumor tissues for generating an automated IR-based histology. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded xenografts of human colon carcinomas were analyzed. Chemometric and statistical multivariate treatments of spectral data permitted to probe the intrinsic chemical composition of tissues, directly from paraffinized sections without previous dewaxing. Reconstructed color-coded spectral images revealed a marked tumor heterogeneity. We identified three spectral clusters associated to tumoral tissues, whereas HE staining revealed only a single structure. Nine other clusters were assigned to either necrotic or host tissues. This spectral histology proved to be consistent over multiple passages of the same xenografted tumor confirming that intratumoral heterogeneity was maintained over time. In addition, developing an innovative image analysis, based on the quantification of neighboring pixels, permitted the identification of two main sequences of spectral clusters related to the tissue spatial organization. Molecular attribution of the spectral differences between the tumor clusters revealed differences of transcriptional activity within these tumor tissue subtypes. In conclusion, IR spectral imaging proves to be highly effective both for reproducible tissue subtype recognition and for tumor heterogeneity characterization. This may represent an attractive tool for routine high throughput diagnostic challenges, independent from visual morphology."

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fluorescence microscopy was used to map and quantify changes in tissue density, tumor vasculature, hypoxia, and the distribution of Hoechst 33342, a perfusion marker, and the anticancer drug, doxorubicin. Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify Ktrans, the volume transfer constant of a solute between the blood vessels and extracellular tissue compartment of the tumor, as a measure of vascular function. Following treatment with Irinophore C, 19F magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor the delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to the tumor tissue, whereas scintigraphy was used to quantify the presence of bound [14C]5-FU. RESULTS: Irinophore C decreased cell density (P = 8.42 x 10(-5)), the overall number of endothelial cells in the entire section (P = 0.014), tumor hypoxia (P = 5.32 x 10(-9)), and K(trans) (P = 0.050). However, treatment increased the ratio of endothelial cells to cell density (P = 0.00024) and the accumulation of Hoechst 33342 (P = 0.022), doxorubicin (P = 0.243 x 10(-5)), and 5-FU (P = 0.0002) in the tumor. Vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8, two proangiogenic factors, were down-regulated, whereas the antiangiogenic factor TIMP-1 was up-regulated in Irinophore C-treated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Irinophore C treatment improves the vascular function of the tumor, thereby reducing tumor hypoxia and increasing the delivery and accumulation of a second drug. Reducing hypoxia would enhance radiotherapy, whereas improving delivery of a second drug to the tumor should result in higher cell kill."

Presently, diagnosis of OSF is done mainly through qualitative histopathological techniques and in the level of diagnostic molecular biology no specific genetic marker is evident. Keeping these facts in mind this study evaluates histopathological changes in the epithelium and subepithelial connective tissue of OSF through quantitative digital image analysis in respect to specific candidate features and analyses null mutations in the GSTM1 and GSTT1 by PCR amplification. The analysis revealed that there are subtle quantitative differences in the histological images of OSF compared to NOM. The thickness of the epithelium and cell population in its different zones, radius of curvature of rete-ridges and connective tissue papillae were decreased but length of rete-ridges and connective tissue papillae, fibrocity and the number of cellular components (predominantly inflammatory cells) in the subepithelial connective tissue were increased in OSF. The PCR study revealed that there is no significant difference in the allelic variants in GSTM1 between OSF and normal, while GSTT1 null gene showed significantly higher frequencies in this precancerous condition. This study establishes a distinct quantitative difference between normal oral mucosa (NOM) and OSF in respect to their histological features and GST null gene frequencies."

We routinely analyzed the blood samples from 440 patients with quantitative and/or qualitative abnormalities detected by the XE-2100 Sysmextrade mark. Only 2.6% of cells are not identified by DM96trade mark. After classification of the unidentified cells very good correlation coefficients are observed between DM96trade mark and manual microscopy for most hematological parameters and accuracy is judged excellent up to 98%. For most common parameters, false positive and false negative ratios are also very good. Whatever the pathology and the number of blasts on smear, all patients were positive for blast detection on DM96trade mark. The system is a useful tool for assisting in the diagnosis and classification of most acute or chronic leukemia. Automatic cell location and preclassification, along with unique cell views on the computer screen, could reduce the time spent performing differentials and make real-time collaboration between colleagues a natural part of the classification process. The workstation also provides an ergonomically correct and relaxed working environment. We suggest its use in routine analysis; the system could be very helpful for the accurate morphological diagnosis of samples from patients with malignant hematological disease."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For each difference-image, pixel intensity histograms of arbitrary-shaped ROIs were computed and fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Time-dependent histogram center-position- and width-parameters are computed during bolus-passage. The method was applied to 25 patients with low and high grade gliomas. RESULTS: During bolus outflow-time, histogram-center-position-parameter and histogram-width-parameter reach highest significance levels and discriminate gliomas of different grades. The histogram center-position-parameter discriminated grade-II from grade-III, grade-II from grade-IV but not grade-III from grade-IV. The observed histogram width-parameters discriminated grade-II from grade-III (P < 0.00022), grade-II from grade-IV (P <8.3 10), and grade-III from grade-IV (P < 0.00063). CONCLUSIONS: DHA is a easy-to-use method for glioma grading; the histogram width parameter is best indicator for histologic grade."

This method provides statistical information about the spatial distribution of greylevels in the image which can be used for classification of different tissue regions. Optimizing the size and complexity of the COM has the potential to enhance the reliability of Texture Analysis results. In this paper we investigate the effect of matrix size and calculation approach on the ability of COM to discriminate between peritumoral white matter and other white matter regions. METHOD: MR images were obtained from patients with histologically confirmed brain glioblastoma using MRI at 3-T giving isotropic resolution of 1 mm3. Three Regions of Interest (ROI) were outlined in visually normal white matter on three image slices based on relative distance from the tumor: one peritumoral white matter region and two distant white matter regions on both hemispheres. Volumes of Interest (VOI) were composed from the three slices. Two different calculation approaches for COM were used: i) Classical approach (CCOM) on each individual ROI, and ii) Three Dimensional approach (3DCOM) calculated on VOIs. For, each calculation approach five dynamic ranges (number of greylevels N) were investigated (N = 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256). RESULTS: Classification showed that peritumoral white matter always represents a homogenous class, separate from other white matter, regardless of the value of N or the calculation approach used. The best test measures (sensitivity and specificity) for average CCOM were obtained for N = 128. These measures were also optimal for 3DCOM with N = 128, which additionally showed a balanced tradeoff between the measures. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the dynamic range used for COM calculation significantly influences the classification results for identical samples. In order to obtain more reliable classification results with COM, the dynamic range must be optimized to avoid too small or sparse matrices. Larger dynamic ranges for COM calculations do not necessarily give better texture results; they might increase the computation costs and limit the method performance."

METHODS: We analysed digitised images of liver biopsy sections taken from 398 patients. The analysis with Dioguardi Histological Metriser was validated by comparison with semi-quantitative scoring system. RESULTS: The method provides: (1) the metrical extension in two-dimensions (the plane) of the residual hepatocellular set, including the area of vacuoles pertinent to abnormal lipid accumulation; (2) the geometric measure of the inflammation basin, which distinguishes intra-basin space and extra-basin dispersed parenchymal leukocytes; (3) the magnitude of collagen islets, (which were considered truncated fractals and classified into three degrees of magnitude); and (4) the tectonic index that quantifies alterations (disorders) in the organization of liver tissue. Dioguardi Histological Metriser machine allows to work at a speed of 0.1 mm(2)/s, scanning a whole section in 6-8 min. CONCLUSION: The results are the first standardized metrical evaluation of the geometric properties of the parenchyma, inflammation, fibrosis, and alterations in liver tissue tectonics of the biopsy sections. The present study confirms that biopsies are still valuable, not only for diagnosing chronic hepatitis, but also for quantifying changes in the organization and order of liver tissue structure."

METHODS: Anterior TZ/AFMS cancers excluding the anterolateral part of peripheral zone, were identified from radical prostatectomy specimens. Morphometric histopathological study included largest surface area, volume and spatial distribution. RESULTS: Out of 91 TZ/AFMS cancers, 79 were <4 cm3 and 69 <2 cm3. Fifty percent and 70% of cancers <4 cm3 were located in the anterior third and inferior half of TZ and/or AFMS, respectively. Cancers <2 cm3 could be classified into three types according to their location related to histologic zone boundaries: TZ type 1 (40%) for cancers confined to one TZ lobe; TZ type 2 (35%) for cancers most represented in one TZ lobe but crossing its anterior boundary; type AFMS (25%) for cancers confined to AFMS. These results form the rationale for the hypothesis that AFMS cancers originate from anterior and medial TZ and due to benign prostatic hypertrophy they become excluded from TZ, anteriorly into AFMS. TZ anterior limit would then act as a barrier to their posterior extension. CONCLUSIONS: TZ/AFMS cancers contours and locations are predictable and conform to histological zones boundaries.

Epub 2008 Nov 13.,Dailey HL,J Appl Physiol (1985),2009,2008/11/15,,,10.1152/japplphysiol.90688.2008,"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by fluid accumulation in small pulmonary airways. The reopening of these fluid-filled airways involves the propagation of an air-liquid interface that exerts injurious hydrodynamic stresses on the epithelial cells (EpC) lining the airway walls. Previous experimental studies have demonstrated that these hydrodynamic stresses may cause rupture of the plasma membrane (i.e., cell necrosis) and have postulated that cell morphology plays a role in cell death. However, direct experimental measurement of stress and strain within the cell is intractable, and limited data are available on the mechanical response (i.e., deformation) of the epithelium during airway reopening. The goal of this study is to use image-based finite element models of cell deformation during airway reopening to investigate how cell morphology and mechanics influence the risk of cell injury/necrosis. Confocal microscopy images of EpC in subconfluent and confluent monolayers were used to generate morphologically accurate three-dimensional finite element models. Hydrodynamic stresses on the cells were calculated from boundary element solutions of bubble propagation in a fluid-filled parallel-plate flow channel. Results indicate that for equivalent cell mechanical properties and hydrodynamic load conditions, subconfluent cells develop higher membrane strains than confluent cells. Strain magnitudes were also found to decrease with increasing stiffness of the cell and membrane/cortex region but were most sensitive to changes in the cell's interior stiffness. These models may be useful in identifying pharmacological treatments that mitigate cell injury during airway reopening by altering specific biomechanical properties of the EpC."

Epub 2008 Nov 14.,Yoo PS,Ann Surg Oncol,2009,2008/11/15,,,10.1245/s10434-008-0209-3,"The purpose of this study is to characterize the expression of HuR in colorectal carcinoma and determine its correlation with clinical outcome. Differential expression of HuR has been suggested to be of prognostic significance in carcinomas of the ovaries, stomach, and breast. HuR regulates the expression of a variety of proteins critical to carcinogenesis via the pathways of cell-cycle progress, invasion, and metastasis. Increasing evidence suggests that angiogenic pathways are involved. A tissue microarray consisting of tumors from 560 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma was analyzed for HuR protein expression using a quantitative, automated immunofluorescent microscopy system (AQUA). Clinical data corresponding to each examined specimen collected through an institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol were analyzed using chi-squared test, Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Median follow-up was 54 months. Along with tumor stage and overall tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, HuR expression was found to be an independent predictor of survival. In patients in the highest quartile of total HuR expression, survival was 22.8 months less than those in the lower quartiles (40.6 versus 63.4 months, p = 0.04). Furthermore, HuR levels correlate positively with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD31, a marker for vascular endothelium. We conclude that expression of high levels of HuR correlates with features of advanced disease and portends poorer survival in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. These results further suggest that HuR exerts its tumorigenic effects through VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target in colorectal cancer."

Fatty infiltration in liver diseases is commonly assessed histologically by semi-quantitative methods, which can be subjective. Automated computerized procedures using commercial software for image analysis have also been recently employed. The aim of the study was to develop an innovative automated computerized procedure to accurately evaluate both the morphometry and degree of lipid accumulation in liver. Fatty infiltration was assessed in paraffin- and resin-embedded samples of steatotic livers from rats undergoing 0, 3, 7, 14, and 30-day choline-deficient diet, and from liver biopsy of a morbidly obese patient undergoing bariatric surgery. Specific software was developed, which works with a morphological operator, in addition to a chromatic one to select lipid droplets. The choline-deficient diet induced steatosis with a gradual shift from micro- to macro-vesicular. In paraffin sections, the macrovesicles-to-microvesicles ratio and the degree of steatosis, when using only the chromatic operator, produced overestimates. Results were consistent in both rat and human samples. An improvement of topographic, morphometric and quantitative estimation of fatty liver infiltration is obtained with our software, working with a morphological operator and using semi-thin sections from resin-embedded samples. This innovative procedure may be applied to human liver samples, offering promising diagnostic and prognostic perspectives."

Epub 2008 Nov 18.,Lim HK,Radiology,2009,2008/11/20,,,10.1148/radiol.2501080207,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively assess the incremental value of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map combined with T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images compared with T2-weighted images alone for prostate cancer detection by using a pathologic map as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was waived. The study included 52 patients (mean age, 65 years +/- 5 [standard deviation]; range, 48-76 years) who underwent endorectal MR imaging and step-section histologic examination. Three readers with varying experience levels reviewed T2-weighted images alone, the ADC map alone, and T2-weighted images and ADC maps. The prostate was divided into 12 segments. The probability of prostate cancer in each segment on MR images was recorded with a five-point scale. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were compared by using the Z test; sensitivity and specificity were determined with the Z test after adjusting for data clustering. RESULTS: AUC of T2-weighted and ADC data (reader 1, 0.90; reader 2, 0.88; reader 3, 0.76) was greater than that of T2-weighted images (reader 1, 0.79; reader 2, 0.75; reader 3, 0.66) for all readers (P < .0001 in all comparisons). AUC of T2-weighted and ADC data was greater for readers 1 and 2 than for reader 3 (P < .001). Sensitivity of T2-weighted and ADC data (reader 1, 88%; reader 2, 81%; and reader 3, 78%) was greater than that of T2-weighted images (reader 1, 74%; reader 2, 67%; reader 3, 67%) for all readers (P = .01 for reader 1; P = .02 for readers 2 and 3). Specificity of T2-weighted and ADC data was greater than that of T2-weighted images for reader 1 (88% vs 79%, P = .03) and reader 2 (89% vs 77%, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The addition of an ADC map to T2-weighted images can improve the diagnostic performance of MR imaging in prostate cancer detection."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one consecutive patients (60 men, 11 women; mean age, 65 years) suspected of having HCC underwent 64-MDCT with coronal reformations. A multiphasic CT protocol that included unenhanced, hepatic arterial, portal venous, and equilibrium phases was performed. Three independent, blinded readers interpreted the transverse scan alone, the coronal scan alone, and the combined transverse and coronal scans for the presence of HCC. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)), and interpretation time were calculated for each reading session. RESULTS: Seventy-six HCC nodules were confirmed in 48 patients using histopathologic analysis or follow-up with long-term CT, MRI, or both (mean follow-up time, 12 months; range, 12-15 months) as the reference standard. Mean sensitivity, positive predictive value, and A(z) value for HCC detection were, respectively, 84% (191/228 readings), 91% (191/210 readings), and 0.85 for the transverse scan alone; 83% (189/228 readings), 93% (189/203 readings), and 0.86 for the coronal scan alone; and 87% (198/228 readings), 93% (198/213 readings), and 0.87 for combined interpretation of transverse and coronal scans. No comparisons were statistically significant. Forty-eight false-positive interpretations were recorded (19 for the transverse, 14 for the coronal, and 15 for the combined interpretation sets). The reading session in which combined transverse and coronal scans were available for interpretation showed significantly superior reader confidence for HCC detection as well as longer interpretation times (p<0.05 for both comparisons). The average reading time for the combined interpretation of transverse and coronal image sets (mean, 12.1+/-0.8 minutes) was significantly longer than for the transverse image set (7.4+/-1.5 minutes) or the coronal image set (7.1+/-1.3 minutes) (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: With 64-MDCT, the addition of isotropic coronal reformations to transverse images significantly improved reader confidence for the detection of HCC, with no statistically significant improvement in sensitivity, positive predictive value, or diagnostic accuracy (as determined by the A(z) value). This improvement comes at the cost of a longer interpretation time."

METHODS: Eleven miniscrew implants (Aarhus Anchorage System, Medicon eG, Tuttlingen, Germany) placed in 5 patients were retrieved after successful service of 3.5 to 17.5 months; none showed signs of mobility or failure. These implants, and brand-, type-, and size-matched specimens as controls, were subjected to multi-technique characterization. RESULTS: Optical microscopy indicated loss of gloss with variable discoloration. Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis showed morphologic alteration of the miniscrew implant surfaces with integuments formed on the surface. The materials precipitated on the surfaces were sodium, potassium, chlorine, iron, calcium, and phosphorus from the contact of the implant with biologic fluids such as blood and exudates, forming sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium-phosphorus precipitates. The composition of the implant was similar to that of a titanium alloy. X-ray microtomography analysis showed no bulk structure alterations. Vickers microhardness testing showed no increased bulk or surface hardness of the retrieved specimens compared with the controls, excluding the possibility of strain-hardening phenomena as a result of self-tapping and self-drilling placement and related loading conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Used titanium-alloy miniscrew implants have morphologic and surface structural alterations including adsorption of an integument that is calcified as a result of contact of the implants with biologic fluids. Randomly organized osseointegration islets on these smooth titanium-alloy miniscrew surfaces might be enhanced by the extended period of retention in alveolar bone in spite of the smooth surface and immediate loading pattern of these implants."

The specimens used were serial sections from 49 human fetuses aged 10-15 weeks. In addition, 3D reconstructions of the mandibular ramus and the CC were made from four specimens. During weeks 10-11 of development, the vascular canals (VC) appear in the CC and the intramembranous ossification process begins. At the same time, in the medial region of the CC, chondroclasts appear adjacent to the vascular invasion and to the cartilage destruction. During weeks 12-13 of development, the deepest portion of the posterolateral vascular canal is completely surrounded by the hypertrophic chondrocytes. The latter emerge with an irregular layout. During week 15 of development, the endochondral ossification of the CC begins. Our results suggest that the situation of the chondroclasts, the posterolateral vascular canal and the irregular arrangement of the hypertrophic chondrocytes may play a notable role in the development of the CC."

Epub 2009 Jan 28.,Merhof D,Stereotact Funct Neurosurg,2009,2009/01/29,,,10.1159/000195720,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging provides information about the location of white matter tracts within the human brain. For neurosurgery, this imaging technique is of major interest in order to minimize the risk of postoperative neurological deficits. In preoperative planning, fiber tracking algorithms based on streamline propagation are used in order to reconstruct major fiber tracts. The resulting streamline bundles approximate the course of the underlying white matter structures and indicate their shape and location in 3 dimensions as well as the spatial relation with respect to surrounding anatomy. However, for intraoperative application in combination with the neuronavigation system, these streamline representations are not adequate. Hulls encompassing the streamline bundles are necessary, since the boundary curves of hulls can be superimposed on the operating room (OR) microscope view for guidance in neurosurgery. METHODS: In this work, we present a novel hull approach which is based on rasterization and isosurface extraction, combined with surface filtering techniques. The advantages of this approach are its robustness and the possibility to control the tightness of wrapping. RESULTS: The approach makes it possible to generate precise hulls for different tract systems, which can be used as a basis for intraoperative visualization in the OR microscope. Distance measurements further confirm the accuracy of the hulls."

Immature metaplastic and dysplastic cervical squamous epithelia turn white after application of acetic acid during the exam. The whitening process occurs visually over several minutes and subjectively helps to discriminate between dysplastic and normal tissue. Digital imaging technologies enable us to assist the physician in analyzing acetowhite (acetic-acid-induced) lesions in a fully automatic way. We report a study designed to measure multiple parameters of the acetowhitening process from two images captured with a digital colposcope. One image is captured before the acetic acid application, and the other is captured after the acetic acid application. The spatial change of the acetowhitening is extracted using color and texture information in the post-acetic-acid image; the temporal change is extracted from the intensity and color changes between the post-acetic-acid and pre-acetic-acid images with an automatic alignment. In particular, we propose an automatic means to calculate an opacity index that indicates the grades of temporal change. The imaging and data analysis system is evaluated with a total of 99 human subjects. The proposed opacity index demonstrates a sensitivity and specificity of 94 and 87%, respectively, for discriminating high-grade dysplasia (CIN2+) from normal and low-grade subjects, considering histology as the gold standard."

Epub 2009 Oct 26.,Eidelman N,Arthritis Res Ther,2009,2009/10/28,PMC2787294,,10.1186/ar2841,"INTRODUCTION: Calcified deposits (CDs) in skin and muscles are common in juvenile dermatomyositis (DM), and less frequent in adult DM. Limited information exists about the microstructure and composition of these deposits, and no information is available on their elemental composition and contents, mineral density (MD) and stiffness. We determined the microstructure, chemical composition, MD and stiffness of CDs obtained from DM patients. METHODS: Surgically-removed calcinosis specimens were analyzed with fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy in reflectance mode (FTIR-RM) to map their spatial distribution and composition, and with scanning electron microscopy/silicon drift detector energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/SDD-EDS) to obtain elemental maps. X-ray diffraction (XRD) identified their mineral structure, X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) mapped their internal structure and 3D distribution, quantitative backscattered electron (qBSE) imaging assessed their morphology and MD, nanoindentation measured their stiffness, and polarized light microscopy (PLM) evaluated the organic matrix composition. RESULTS: Some specimens were composed of continuous carbonate apatite containing small amounts of proteins with a mineral to protein ratio much higher than in bone, and other specimens contained scattered agglomerates of various sizes with similar composition (FTIR-RM). Continuous or fragmented mineralization was present across the entire specimens (microCT). The apatite was much more crystallized than bone and dentin, and closer to enamel (XRD) and its calcium/phosphorous ratios were close to stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (SEM/SDD-EDS). The deposits also contained magnesium and sodium (SEM/SDD-EDS). The MD (qBSE) was closer to enamel than bone and dentin, as was the stiffness (nanoindentation) in the larger dense patches. Large mineralized areas were typically devoid of collagen; however, collagen was noted in some regions within the mineral or margins (PLM). qBSE, FTIR-RM and SEM/SDD-EDS maps suggest that the mineral is deposited first in a fragmented pattern followed by a wave of mineralization that incorporates these particles. Calcinosis masses with shorter duration appeared to have islands of mineralization, whereas longstanding deposits were solidly mineralized. CONCLUSIONS: The properties of the mineral present in the calcinosis masses are closest to that of enamel, while clearly differing from bone. Calcium and phosphate, normally present in affected tissues, may have precipitated as carbonate apatite due to local loss of mineralization inhibitors."

This enables the behavioral study of sub-cellular structures during different phases of the cell cycle. The varying punctuate patterns of fluorescence, drastic changes in SNR, shape and position during mitosis and abundance of touching cells, however, require more sophisticated algorithms for reliable automatic cell segmentation and lineage analysis. Since the cell nuclei are non-uniform in appearance, a distribution-based modeling of foreground classes is essential. The recently proposed graph partitioning active contours (GPAC) algorithm supports region descriptors and flexible distance metrics. We extend GPAC for fluorescence-based cell segmentation using regional density functions and dramatically improve its efficiency for segmentation from O(N(4)) to O(N(2)), for an image with N(2) pixels, making it practical and scalable for high throughput microscopy imaging studies."

Histological sections from 150 invasive ductal breast cancers were stained with MG-PY and the following parameters were evaluated by computer image analysis: the nucleolar area, long to short nucleolar axis ratio, nucleolar shape parameter assessing the degree of nucleolar roundness, long to short nuclear axis ratio, number of nucleoli in the nucleus and the percentage of the nuclear cross-section surface area occupied by the nucleoli. A statistically significant association between a nucleolar shape polymorphism and the number of nucleoli in the nuclei of tumour cells and the RFS but not OS was found in the entire group of patients as well as patients with axillary lymph node metastases. A higher polymorphism of nucleolar shape and a higher number of nucleoli in the nuclei of breast cancer cells were associated with decreased relapse-free survival (p < 0.05). The remaining morphometric parameters showed no statistically significant association with RFS or OS. The results indicate that morphometry of nucleoli in MG-PY stained histological sections can be useful in the analysis of associations between nucleolar parameters and prognosis of patients with invasive breast cancer."

The advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows researchers to extend the study of asymmetry to a microscopic scale by examining fiber integrity differences across hemispheres rather than the macroscopic differences in shape or structure volumes. Even so, the power to detect these microarchitectural differences depends on the sample size and how the brain images are registered and how many subjects are studied. We fluidly registered 4 Tesla DTI scans from 180 healthy adult twins (45 identical and fraternal pairs) to a geometrically-centered population mean template. We computed voxelwise maps of significant asymmetries (left/right hemisphere differences) for common fiber anisotropy indices (FA, GA). Quantitative genetic models revealed that 47-62% of the variance in asymmetry was due to genetic differences in the population. We studied how these heritability estimates varied with the type of registration target (T1- or T2-weighted) and with sample size. All methods consistently found that genetic factors strongly determined the lateralization of fiber anisotropy, facilitating the quest for specific genes that might influence brain asymmetry and fiber integrity."

Cell segmentation is the basis of quantitative analysis of the immense cellular images. However, the complicated cell morphological appearance in phase-contrast microscopy images challenges the existing segmentation methods. This paper proposes a new cell segmentation method for cancer cell migration studies using phase-contrast images. Instead of segmenting cells directly based on commonly used low-level features, e.g., intensity and gradient, we first identify the leading protrusions, a high level feature, of cancer cells. Based on the identified cell leading protrusions, we introduce a front vector flow guided active contour, which guides the initial cell boundaries to the real boundaries. The experimental validation on a set of breast cancer cell images shows that the proposed method demonstrates fast, stable, and accurate segmentation for breast cancer cells with wide range of sizes and shapes."

Early evidence indicates that specific markers for alpha and beta cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans can be used for early T2DM diagnosis. Currently, the analysis of such histological tissues is manually performed by trained pathologists using a light microscope. To objectify classification results and to reduce the processing time of histological tissues, an automated computational pathology framework for segmentation of pancreatic islets from histopathological fluorescence images is proposed. Due to high variability in the staining intensities for alpha and beta cells, classical medical imaging approaches fail in this scenario. The main contribution of this paper consists of a novel graph-based segmentation approach based on cell nuclei detection with randomized tree ensembles. The algorithm is trained via a cross validation scheme on a ground truth set of islet images manually segmented by 4 expert pathologists. Test errors obtained from the cross validation procedure demonstrate that the graph-based computational pathology analysis proposed is performing competitively to the expert pathologists while outperforming a baseline morphological approach."

Several authors confirmed, that Ki-67 LI has prognostic significance and correlates with likelihood of tumour recurrences. These observations were widely accepted by pathologists, but up till now no standard method for Ki-67 LI assessment was developed and introduced for the diagnostic pathology. In this paper we present a new computerised system for automated Ki-67 LI estimation in meningiomas as an aid for histological grading of meningiomas and potential standard method of Ki-67 LI assessment. We also discuss the concordance of Ki-67 LI results obtained by presented computerized system and expert pathologist, as well as possible pitfalls and mistakes in automated counting of immunopositive or negative cells. For the quantitative evaluation of digital images of meningiomas the designed software uses an algorithm based on mathematical description of cell morphology. This solution acts together with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) used in the classification mode for the recognition of immunoreactivity of cells. The applied sequential thresholding simulated well the human process of cell recognition. The same digital images of randomly selected tumour areas were parallelly analysed by computer and blindly by two expert pathologists. Ki-67 labeling indices were estimated and the results compared. The mean relative discrepancy between the levels of Ki-67 LI by our system and by the human expert did not exceed 14% in all investigated cases. These preliminary results suggest that the designed software could be an useful tool supporting the diagnostic digital pathology. However, more extended studies are needed for approval of this suggestion."

The receptor-mediated delivery of bioconjugated Mnd-QDs into pancreatic cancer cells was demonstrated using the confocal microscopy technique. Cytotoxicity of Mnd-QDs on live cells has been evaluated. The NIR-emitting characteristic of the QDs has been exploited to acquire whole animal body imaging with high contrast signals. In addition, histological and blood analysis of mice have revealed that no long-term toxic effects arise from MnD-QDs. These studies suggest multimodal Mnd-QDs have the potentials as probes for early pancreatic cancer imaging and detection."
18040874,Comet Assay measurements: a perspective,"Kumaravel TS, Vilhar B, Faux SP, Jha AN.",Cell Biol Toxicol. 2009 Feb;25(1):53-64. doi: 10.1007/s10565-007-9043-9. Epub 2007 Nov 27.,Kumaravel TS,Cell Biol Toxicol,2009,2007/11/28,,,10.1007/s10565-007-9043-9,"The Comet Assay or single cell gel electrophoresis assay is one of the very widely used assays to microscopically detect DNA damage at the level of a single cell. The determination of damage is carried out either through visual scoring of cells (after classification into different categories on the basis of tail length and shape) or by using different commercially available or public domain software (which automatically recognise the extent of damage). In this assay, the shape, size and amount of DNA within the 'comet' play important roles in the determination of the level of damage. The use of a software in particular also provides a range of different parameters, many of which might not be relevant in determining the extent of DNA damage. As a large number of factors could influence the shape, size, identification and determination of induced damage, which includes the scoring criteria, staining techniques, selection of parameters (whilst using the software packages) and appearance of 'hedgehog' or 'clouds', this article aims (a) to provide an overview of evolution of measurements of DNA damage using the Comet Assay and (b) to summarise and critically analyse the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches currently being adopted whilst using this assay. It is suggested that judicious selection of different parameters, staining methods along with inter-laboratory validation and harmonisation of methodologies will further help in making this assay more robust and widely acceptable for scientific as well as regulatory studies."

Over the last 20 years, automated imaging processes have started to be introduced where stained blood films are scanned by a computer-driven microscope and leucocytes classified; however, early methods were slow and had difficulty in classifying abnormal cells. More recently the CellaVision DM96 (CellaVision AB, Lund, Sweden) has been introduced with added features such as continuous loading of slides and a faster throughput than previous instruments. The accuracy of CellaVision DM96 has been evaluated by comparing results to reference manual differentials. Results from different operators using the DM96 were compared with their own manual differential and to a 400-cell reference manual differential. Precision of the instrument was compared to the manual differential. The preclassification accuracy of the DM96 was 89.2%. Precision was similar to that of the 100-cell manual differential. The DM96 was faster than the manual method, even after reclassification by a laboratory scientist of any cells wrongly categorized by the instrument. The DM96 accuracy in morphological classification of leucocytes and red blood cells; depends upon both blood pathology and experience of the laboratory scientist using the instrument. For some cell types and operators, DM96 accuracy was better than the individual's 100 cell manual differential."

They are associated in the adult brain with functional and anatomical hemispheric asymmetries in the speech perception-production network and in the sensori-motor system. Only studies in early life can help us to understand how such asymmetries arise during brain development, and to which point structural left-right differences are the source or the consequence of functional lateralization. In this study, we aimed to provide new in vivo structural markers of hemispheric asymmetries in infants from 1 to 4 months of age, with diffusion tensor imaging. We used 3 complementary analysis methods based on local diffusion indices and spatial localizations of tracts. After a prospective approach over the whole brain, we demonstrated early leftward asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus and in the cortico-spinal tract. These results suggest that the early macroscopic geometry, microscopic organization, and maturation of these white matter bundles are related to the development of later functional lateralization."

Sixty-three patients with histopathologic diagnosis of glioblastomas (22 men, 16 women, mean age 58.4 years) and brain metastases (13 men, 12 women, mean age 56.3 years) were included in this study. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), CL and CP maps were co-registered and each lesion was semi-automatically subdivided into four regions: central, enhancing, immediate peritumoral and distant peritumoral. DTI metrics as well as the normalized signal intensity from the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were measured from each region. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the best model for classification. The results demonstrated that FA, CL and CP from glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of brain metastases from all segmented regions (p<0.05), and the differences from the enhancing regions were most significant (p<0.001). FA and CL from the enhancing region had the highest prediction accuracy when used alone with an area under the curve of 0.90. The best logistic regression model included three parameters (ADC, FA and CP) from the enhancing part, resulting in 92% sensitivity, 100% specificity and area under the curve of 0.98. We conclude that DTI metrics, used individually or combined, have a potential as a non-invasive measure to differentiate glioblastomas from metastases."

STUDY DESIGN: Morphology-based segmentation strategies and the Support Vector Machine approach have been used for the accurate extraction and recognition of the cells. To achieve the highest possible accuracy, 2 specialized systems specially suited for Ki-67 and ER/PR staining have been developed. RESULTS: The testing set of histologic slides of Ki-67 and ER/PR staining has been assessed by our system and the results compared to the score of a human expert. The results are in good agreement. The average differences are within the acceptable limits of 10%. The main advantage of the system is its absolute repeatability of scores. CONCLUSION: The proposed computer-assisted automatic system of cell extraction and recognition through nuclei staining has confirmed sufficient accuracy for the tested images and may provide a useful tool for cell recognition and counting on the basis of histologic slides with Ki-67 and ER/PR staining."

METHODS: All patients from 1992 to 2005 with a histologically verified malignant breast lesion and a mammogram at our department, were analyzed in retrospect focussing on the time of detection of the malignant lesion. All prior mammograms were analyzed by CAD (CADx, USA). The resulting CAD printout was matched with the cancer containing images yielding to the radiological diagnosis of breast cancer. CAD performance, sensitivity as well as the association of CAD and radiological features were analyzed. RESULTS: 278 mammograms fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 111 cases showed a retrospectively visible lesion (71 masses, 23 single microcalcification clusters, 16 masses with microcalcifications, in one case two microcalcification clusters). 54/87 masses and 34/41 microcalcifications were detected by CAD. Detection rates varied from 9/20 (ACR 1) to 5/7 (ACR 4) (45% vs. 71%). The detection of microcalcifications was not influenced by breast tissue density. CONCLUSION: CAD might be useful in an earlier detection of subtle breast cancer cases, which might remain otherwise undetected."

Epub 2008 Mar 6.,Schell AJ,Cardiovasc Pathol,2009,2008/04/12,,,10.1016/j.carpath.2008.01.002,"BACKGROUND: The majority of cardiac atrial neoplasms represent benign myxomas. Rarely, malignant cardiac neoplasms are encountered and can include primary cardiac neoplasms, as well as secondary tumors involving the heart. As many cardiac neoplasms lack pathognomonic clinical features, histopathologic diagnosis is crucial for classification and appropriate treatment of these neoplasms. Molecular investigation is critical to begin to catalogue genomic changes that correlate with these malignancies. METHODS: A 60-year-old man presented with superior vena cava syndrome, and computed tomographic scan revealed an infiltrative mass of the right atrium that nearly filled the atrial chamber and partially occluded superior vena cava flow. Urgent surgical resection revealed a soft mass with the appearance of ""fish flesh."" Histologic, immunochistochemical, cytogenetic, and detailed molecular investigations were carried out. RESULTS: Histologic examination revealed complete replacement of the atrial wall by diffuse sheets of pleomorphic lymphoid cells with occasional smaller plasmacytoid cells. The predominant lymphoid population was immunoreactive for CD45, CD20, CD79a, BCL-2, BCL-6, Ki-67, CD10, p53, and light chain restricted for IgM lambda. A diagnosis of primary cardiac diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytoid differentiation was established and was supported by cytogenetic studies demonstrating the presence of a t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation in addition to other chromosomal abnormalities. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed no evidence of a C-MYC translocation. CONCLUSION: In this single case, comparative genomic hybridization analysis using both bacterial artificial chromosome and oligonucleotide arrays correlated well with cytogenetic findings and allows for the cataloguing of more subtle genomic events."

Brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) protein is associated with hippocampal development and plasticity, and in mood disorder pathophysiology. We tested the hypotheses that both the BDNF val66met polymorphism and BD diagnosis are associated with decreased hippocampus volume, and that individuals with BD who carry the met allele have the smallest hippocampus volumes compared to individuals without BD and val/val homozygotes. We further explored localization of morphological differences within hippocampus in BD associated with the met allele. Twenty individuals with BD and 18 healthy comparison (HC) subjects participated in high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans from which hippocampus volumes were defined and measured. We used linear mixed model analysis to study effects of diagnosis and BDNF genotype on hippocampus volumes. We then employed three-dimensional mapping to localize areas of change within the hippocampus associated with the BDNF met allele in BD. We found that hippocampus volumes were significantly smaller in BD compared to HC subjects, and presence of the BDNF met allele was associated with smaller hippocampus volume in both diagnostic groups. The BD subgroup who carried the BDNF met allele had the smallest hippocampus volumes, and three-dimensional mapping identified these decreases as most prominent in left anterior hippocampus. These results support effects of BD diagnosis and BDNF genotype on hippocampus structure and suggest a genetic subgroup within BD who may be most vulnerable to deficits in hippocampus and may most benefit from interventions that influence BDNF-mediated signaling."

The histopathologic features of chronic HP (CHP) have not been studied extensively. We examined the pathologic characteristics of 16 autopsy cases of clinically confirmed CHP and compared them with 11 cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia (IPF/UIP). To clarify the exact intralobular location of the fibrotic lesions, we conducted 3-dimensional reconstruction of fibrosis of CHP and IPF/UIP. Granuloma was not detected in any CHP case. Similar to IPF/UIP, honeycombing lesions were found dominantly in the lower lobes in most CHP cases; upper lobe dominance and asymmetrical distribution of honeycomb lesions were more frequent in CHP than in IPF/UIP. In all lungs affected by CHP, centrilobular fibrosis was outstanding, often connecting to the perilobular areas in the appearance of ""bridging fibrosis,"" which was clearly demonstrated by 3-dimensional imaging. Centrilobular and bridging fibrosis were significantly more conspicuous in CHP than IPF/UIP; however, considerable overlap was found. It is important to thoroughly explore the possibility of antigen exposure in cases of lungs with UIP with centrilobular fibrosis to discriminate CHP from IPF/UIP."

However, manual FISH analysis is time-consuming and may introduce large inter-reader variability. In this study, a computerized scheme is developed and tested. It automatically detects and analyzes FISH spots depicted on microscopic fluorescence images. The scheme includes two stages: (1) a feature-based classification rule to detect useful interphase cells, and (2) a knowledge-based expert classifier to identify splitting FISH spots and improve the accuracy of counting independent FISH spots. The scheme then classifies detected analyzable cells as normal or abnormal. In this study, 150 FISH images were acquired from Pap-smear specimens and examined by both an experienced cytogeneticist and the scheme. The results showed that (1) the agreement between the cytogeneticist and the scheme was 96.9% in classifying between analyzable and unanalyzable cells (Kappa=0.917), and (2) agreements in detecting normal and abnormal cells based on FISH spots were 90.5% and 95.8% with Kappa=0.867. This study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH analysis, which may potentially improve detection efficiency and produce more accurate and consistent results than manual FISH analysis."

Although DNA analysis through STR-typing is possible in principle, it is not very promising for telogenic hair or single hairs. For the mixed traces frequently found in practice, composed of different hair from an unknown number of individuals, mtDNA sequencing of each individual hair seems to be the only possible, even if technically elaborate, solution. If it were possible to pool all hair belonging to an individual prior to DNA analysis, then this effort could not only be reduced, but the number of hair for an STR-approach could also be increased. Although it is possible to examine hair microscopically, this method must be considered unsuitable for pooling, since the results depend strongly on examiner experience, and the hair cannot always be correctly attributed to an individual. The goal of this study was to develop an objective non-DNA-contaminative pooling method for hair. To this end, the efficacy of spectral imaging as a method of obtaining information--beyond that obtained from a purely microscopic and morphological approach--for the identification of individuals was investigated. Three hairs each from 25 test persons (female: 18; male: 7) were examined with a SpectraCube-System and a light microscope. Six spectra were calculated for each hair, and the hairs from each individual were not only compared to each other, but also to those of the other individuals. From a forensic vantage, the examination showed, in particular, that individuals, whose hair could not be distinguished on the basis of morphology, could also not be accurately distinguished with the SpectraCube. The intra-individual differences were, in part, greater than the inter-individual differences. Altogether, the study shows that a person's hair color, as perceived, is composed of many naturally different, individual colors."

We adopted areal density profiles as a means of sampling the cortex. On the profiles, we isolated and quantified the density of individual cortical layers. These features may serve as criteria in objective definitions in a way that builds on qualitative observations found in the classical literature. A preprocessing procedure was introduced to overcome artefacts in the density profiles caused by the partial overlap of neighboring neuronal layers and cortical folding. We applied this method to the medial half of the orbital frontal cortex in specimens drawn from 10 human postmortem brain hemispheres. The measurements successfully confirmed the existence of several qualitatively observed areas (architectonic areas 14c, 14r, 11m, 11 and 13). The selection of specific sampling parameters was justified on the basis of simultaneous measurements of the cortical morphology which demonstrate its influence on the appearance of the cortical layers. We also examined the robustness of the measuring procedure by analyzing the outcome of varying systematically the sampling parameters. We describe here a novel method of sampling the cortex for architectonic analysis and demonstrate its application on histological sections obtained from the medial half of the human orbitofrontal cortex."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totally 94 solid lesions with histopathological results in 49 patients were included in the study. US features of the lesions were classified according to American College of Radiologists (ACR) BI-RADS US lexicon. Lesions were evaluated qualitatively according to their PDUS properties and quantitatively with spectral analysis. Hypervascularity, penetration of vessels into the mass or branching-disordered course and resistivity index values higher than 0.85 were accepted as probable malignant criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-five of 94 lesions were benign (58.5%), while 39 (41.5%) were malignant histopathologically. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of US and PDUS in the diagnosis of malignant lesions were 100%, 58.2%, 62.9%, 100% and 71.8%, 81.8%, 73.7%, 80.4%, respectively. Criteria used for the distinction of malignant and benign lesions like number of vessels (p<0.05), distribution of tumoral vessels, morphology of vessels and resistivity index values higher than 0.85 showed statistically significant difference (p<0.001). When sonographic findings were combined with PDUS and spectral analysis findings, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 100%, 52.7%, 60% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: PDUS and spectral analysis have no contribution to BI-RADS US. For the spectral analysis, when RI value is one or greater, malignancy risk significantly increases."

Such assessments depend on human observer subjectivity, and thus have drawn criticism on the basis of associated inter- and intraobserver variability. We report a newly developed computational image analysis procedure for fully automated and fully objective assessment of the Mankin scale. Image processing routines were developed in a widely used programming environment (Matlab) to analyze cartilage degradation. One hundred and twenty-five histology images incorporating a wide range of degradation features were analyzed by the algorithm and by seven observers experienced in cartilage histologic assessment. Based on random effects linear statistical models, the computer program performed well, showing a correlation of 0.88 between its Mankin scores and latent (average of human observers') image scores. Regarding the four subcomponents of the Mankin scale, computer program correlations with observer scores were best for surface defect and proteoglycan depletion, but less favorable for cellularity and tidemark invasion. While limitations exist with image processing techniques, the new algorithm provides an objective and automated method for analyzing cartilage histology sections, consistent with human observer grading."

The current standard for steatosis assessment is histological grading, although there is variability in the scoring systems used. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare steatosis assessment by image analysis and histological grading. METHODS: Three methods were used to measure steatosis: histological grading (from 0 to 4); estimation of the percentage of hepatocytes (to nearest 5%) with steatosis; and computer-assisted image analysis. Image analysis was performed on multiple fields for each biopsy with image pro plus 4.5, with steatotic droplets identified on the basis of shape, colour and size. Computer-selected objects were reviewed to ensure that these were steatotic droplets. The predictive accuracy of the three techniques was assessed using measures of obesity and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) as the outcome variables. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the results of image analysis and histological grade (r(s)=0.89, P<0.01), and estimated per cent steatosis (r(s)=0.93, P<0.01). The variability in the area of steatosis calculated by image analysis in different fields of a biopsy correlated with the total steatosis area (r(s)=0.93, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Image analysis did not offer any additional predictive value when the association between degree of obesity or insulin resistance was correlated with the different methods of assessing steatosis. Image analysis allows measurement of area of steatosis in liver biopsy material and generates a continuous variable that facilitates statistical analysis. These aspects may prove beneficial in research settings."

DTI gives information about the tissue structure; a high fractional anisotropy (FA) indicates a highly structured orientation of the tissue, fibers, or white matter tracts. Based on the tensor rank, a set of three metrics has been described that can be used to measure the directional dependence of diffusion: linear anisotropy (CL), planar anisotropy (CP), and spherical anisotropy (CS). DTM takes into account the shape of diffusion anisotropy and hence may provide better insight into the orientation of structures than FA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI was performed in three patients with epidermoid cysts. FA, directionally-averaged mean diffusivity (Dav), exponential apparent diffusion coefficient (eADC), and DTM, such as CL, CP, and CS, were measured from the tumor core as well as from the normal-appearing white matter. Histopathological correlation was obtained. RESULTS: Epidermoid cysts showed high FA with Dav values similar to that of normal white matter. eADC maps did not show any restriction of diffusion. FA values were high, but not as high as that for the white matter. CP values were higher and CL values were lower than those obtained for the white matter in various regions. CONCLUSION: High CP values suggest preferential diffusion of water molecules along a two-dimensional geometry, which could be attributed to the well-structured orientation of keratin filaments and flakes within the tumor as demonstrated by histopathology. Advanced imaging modalities like DTI with DTM can provide information regarding the microstructural anatomy of the epidermoid cysts."

METHODS: For this study, we included 281 lesions from 267 patients that were diagnosed as benign or malignant by sonographically guided biopsy and prospectively analyzed by conventional sonography and sonographic elastography from October to December 2007. The histopathologic results from sonographically guided biopsy were used as a reference standard. The final assessments were made prospectively on the basis of conventional sonography alone and then by sonographic elastography combined with conventional sonography. The diagnostic performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (A(z)) was compared on the basis of conventional sonography alone and on elastography combined with conventional sonography. We also calculated the area ratio of lesions detected by elastography and the elasticity score reported by Itoh et al (Radiology 2006; 239:341-350). RESULTS: The areas under the ROC curve for conventional sonography and the combination of conventional sonography and sonographic elastography were 0.927 and 0.876, respectively. The area ratio of the lesion had better diagnostic performance (A(z), 0.757) than the elasticity score (A(z), 0.54; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of radiologists with respect to the characterization of breast masses as benign or malignant was not significantly improved with sonographic elastography. The area ratio of the lesion had a better diagnostic value in elastography than the elasticity score."

STUDY DESIGN: In order to preserve the texture of the nuclear chromatin in the corrected digital imagery, it is necessary to correct the images pixel for pixel. This is accomplished by mapping each pixel's value onto the cumulative frequency distribution of the data set to which the image belongs, to transfer to the cumulative frequency distribution of the data set serving as standard and to project the intersection down onto the pixel optical density scale for the corrected value. RESULTS: Feature values in the corrected imagery, for the majority of features used in karyometry, are between < 1% and a few percent of the feature values in standard imagery. For some higher-order statistical features involving multiple pixels, sensitivity to a shift in the cumulative frequency distribution may exist, and a secondary small correction by a factor may be required. CONCLUSION: The correction algorithm allows the elimination of the effects of small staining differences on karyometric analysis."

These studies include complex multimodal investigations with advanced measurement and simulation techniques. We first discuss the complex flows within the total cavopulmonary connection in Fontan patients. We emphasize the quantification of energy losses by studying the importance of caval offsets as well as the differences among various Fontan surgical protocols. In our studies of the fluid mechanics of prosthetic heart valves, we reveal for the first time the full three-dimensional complexity of flow fields in the vicinity of bileaflet and trileaflet valves and the microscopic hinge flow dynamics. We also present results of these valves functioning in a patient-specific native aorta geometry. Our in vitro mitral valve studies show the complex mechanism of the native mitral valve apparatus. We demonstrate that the different components of the mitral valve have independent and synergistically complex functions that allow the valve to operate efficiently. We also show how valve mechanics change under pathological and repair conditions associated with enlarged ventricles. Finally, our ex vivo studies on the interactions between the aortic valve and its surrounding hemodynamic environment are aimed at providing insights into normal valve function and valve pathology. We describe the development of organ- and tissue-culture systems and the biological response of the tissue subjected to their respective simulated mechanical environment. The studies noted above have enhanced our understanding of the complex fluid mechanics associated with the cardiovascular system and have led to new translational technologies."

Epub 2008 Aug 14.,Chang H,Bioinformatics,2009,2008/08/16,PMC2666809,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btn426,"Bright field imaging of biological samples stained with antibodies and/or special stains provides a rapid protocol for visualizing various macromolecules. However, this method of sample staining and imaging is rarely employed for direct quantitative analysis due to variations in sample fixations, ambiguities introduced by color composition and the limited dynamic range of imaging instruments. We demonstrate that, through the decomposition of color signals, staining can be scored on a cell-by-cell basis. We have applied our method to fibroblasts grown from histologically normal breast tissue biopsies obtained from two distinct populations. Initially, nuclear regions are segmented through conversion of color images into gray scale, and detection of dark elliptic features. Subsequently, the strength of staining is quantified by a color decomposition model that is optimized by a graph cut algorithm. In rare cases where nuclear signal is significantly altered as a result of sample preparation, nuclear segmentation can be validated and corrected. Finally, segmented stained patterns are associated with each nuclear region following region-based tessellation. Compared to classical non-negative matrix factorization, proposed method: (i) improves color decomposition, (ii) has a better noise immunity, (iii) is more invariant to initial conditions and (iv) has a superior computing performance."

We investigated the role of this phenomenon in the pathogenesis and progression of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Archived tissue from primary tumors (n=325), brain metastases (n=48) and adjacent bronchial epithelial specimens (n=192) were analyzed for immunohistochemical expression by image analysis of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, integrin-alpha v beta 6, vimentin, and matrix metalloproteinase-9. The findings were compared with the patients' clinicopathologic features. High expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype (low E-cadherin and high N-cadherin, integrin-alpha v beta 6, vimentin, and matrix metalloproteinase-9) was found in most lung tumors examined, and the expression pattern varied according to the tumor histologic type. Low E-cadherin membrane and high N-cadherin cytoplasmic expression were significantly more common in squamous cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma (P=0.002 and 0.005, respectively). Dysplastic lesions had significantly lower expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype than the squamous cell carcinomas, and integrin-alpha v beta 6 membrane expression increased stepwise according to the histopathologic severity. Brain metastases had decreased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition expression compared with primary tumors. Brain metastases had significantly lower integrin-alpha v beta 6 membrane (P=0.04), N-cadherin membrane, and cytoplasm (P<0.0002) expression than the primary tumors. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype is commonly expressed in primary squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung; this expression occurs early in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma. Brain metastases showed characteristics of reversed mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. Our findings suggest that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is a potential target for lung cancer chemoprevention and therapy."

Epub 2009 Jan 24.,Volz S,Neuroimage,2009,2009/04/08,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.01.018,"T2-weighted gradient echo (GE) images yield good contrast of iron-rich structures like the subthalamic nuclei due to microscopic susceptibility induced field gradients, providing landmarks for the exact placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes in Parkinson's disease treatment. An additional advantage is the low radio frequency (RF) exposure of GE sequences. However, T2-weighted images are also sensitive to macroscopic field inhomogeneities, resulting in signal losses, in particular in orbitofrontal and temporal brain areas, limiting anatomical information from these areas. In this work, an image correction method for multi-echo GE data based on evaluation of phase information for field gradient mapping is presented and tested in vivo on a 3 Tesla whole body MR scanner. In a first step, theoretical signal losses are calculated from the gradient maps and a pixelwise image intensity correction is performed. In a second step, intensity corrected images acquired at different echo times TE are combined using optimized weighting factors: in areas not affected by macroscopic field inhomogeneities, data acquired at long TE are weighted more strongly to achieve the contrast required. For large field gradients, data acquired at short TE are favored to avoid signal losses. When compared to the original data sets acquired at different TE and the respective intensity corrected data sets, the resulting combined data sets feature reduced signal losses in areas with major field gradients, while intensity profiles and a contrast-to-noise (CNR) analysis between subthalamic nucleus, red nucleus and the surrounding white matter demonstrate good contrast in deep brain areas."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed our clinical records from 2000 to 2007 retrospectively and identified 5 patients with HP of the head and neck. The records of each patient with head and neck HP were evaluated for age, sex, location of primary, clinical course, treatment, and tumor embolization (if performed). Pathologic slides of all patients were reviewed to identify histologic features and correlation with the clinical course and outcome for each lesion. RESULTS: Five patients with HP that arose from head and neck sites were identified. Five patients included 3 women and 2 men aged 9 to 52 years, with an average of 33.2 years. Each lesion of the patients derived from different parts of the head and neck. The most common complaints were painless mass (3 of 5) and nasal airway obstruction (3 of 5). Magnetic resonance imaging of the 3 patients reflected hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with diffuse enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium. Angiography was performed to all these 3 patients, and only 1 patient with cranial HP involvement did not show significant vascularity. Two patients had preoperative histopathologic results. All patients were operated on with appropriate approach. Pathologic slides of all patients were investigated and graded according to the tumor diameter, cellularity, mitotic rate, and necrosis. CONCLUSION: Differential diagnosis of clinical features and radiologic and pathologic aspects must be managed more carefully. Diagnostic way of these tumors has different pitfalls for the clinician."

Previous researchers did not tackle the histologic features of the lip from this point of view. Half lip was obtained from different well-preserved cadavers where the upper lip, lower lip, and lip angle were evaluated by coronal histologic sections. A total of 43 slides were studied and photographed using light and digital microscopes (Nikon COOLSCOPE, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The cadavers (26 men and 17 women) were in the age group of 45 to 65 years old, and older than 65 years. Data were entered on a study pro forma and statistically analyzed. Normal histologic features of the upper lip, intermediate, and the inner lip sections were observed. Fibrous septations that sometimes had muscular components inserting into them could be identified. In between these septations, there were loose areas (chambers). The mean numbers of chambers identified in the upper and lower lips were higher in the red areas, and more septations and chambers were identified in the lower lip. New histologic observations were classified into types 1 to 7. Significant relations were identified between the total number of septations and chambers in relation to age group and sex. Higher means of septations and chambers were detected in the age group older than 65 years, and in women as a whole. In conclusion, the findings detected in this work could explain the congenital lip pits that are familial or syndromic and many post-lip augmentation complications."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 64 digital mammograms with 16 histologically proven abnormal findings (eight masses and eight microcalcifications) and 48 normal breasts. Two image-processing algorithms were applied to the digital images, which were acquired using General Electric units. The commercially available advanced and standard postprocessed digital mammograms were evaluated in a localization receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve experiment involving seven mammography radiographers. RESULTS: The mean area under the ROC curve was 0.921 +/- 0.022 for the commercially available advanced postprocessed digital mammograms session and 0.904 +/- 0.026 for the standard postprocessed digital mammograms session (P = 0.1953). Observer agreement among the readers was better for the advanced postprocessed digital mammograms than for the standard postprocessed digital mammograms. CONCLUSION: During soft-copy reading, the interpretation accuracy might be influenced by the postprocessing algorithm."

A quasi-confocal reflectance imaging system was used to directly measure the tissue scatter reflectance in situ, and the spectrum was used to identify the scattering power, amplitude, and total wavelength-integrated intensity. Pancreatic tumor and normal samples were characterized using the instrument, and subtle changes in the scatter signal were encountered within regions of each sample. Discrimination between normal versus tumor tissue was readily performed using a K-nearest neighbor classifier algorithm. A similar approach worked for regions of tumor morphology when statistical preprocessing of the scattering parameters was included to create additional data features. This type of automated interpretation methodology can provide a tool for guiding surgical resection in areas where microscopy imaging cannot be realized efficiently by the surgeon. In addition, the results indicate important design changes for future systems."

Some studies of pathologic subtypes have also suggested specific atrophy patterns; however, results are inconsistent. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that clinical, but not pathologic, classification (FTD with ubiquitin inclusions [FTD-U] and FTD with tau inclusions [FTD-T]) is associated with predictable patterns of regional atrophy. METHODS: Magnetic resonance scans of nine FTD-U and six FTD-T patients (histologically confirmed) were compared with 25 controls using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Analyses were conducted with the patient group classified according to histologic or clinical variant. Additionally, three Alzheimer pathology patients who had the syndrome of SEMD in life (FTD-A) were analyzed. RESULTS: The VBM studies in clinical variants confirmed established patterns of atrophy (SEMD, rostral temporal; bvFTD, mesial frontal; PNFA, left insula). FTD-U and FTD-T VBM results were very similar, showing severe atrophy in the temporal poles, mesial frontal lobe, and insulae. A conjunction analysis confirmed this similarity. Subgroup analysis found that SEMD associated with either FTD-T or FTD-U was associated with similar rostral temporal atrophy; however, FTD-A had a qualitatively different pattern of left hippocampal atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: While there is predictable atrophy for clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), histologic FTD variants show no noticeable differences. Reports of specific atrophy profiles are likely the result of idiosyncrasies in small groups. Semantic dementia associated with Alzheimer pathology, however, presented a distinct atrophy pattern."

However, available clinical imaging does not separate antitumor effects from antipermeability effects of these agents. Thus although anti-VEGF agents may decrease tumor contrast-enhancement, vascularity, and edema, the mechanisms leading to improved survival in patients remain incompletely understood. Our goal was to determine whether alleviation of edema by anti-VEGF agents alone could increase survival in mice. METHODS: We treated mice bearing three different orthotopic models of glioblastoma with a VEGF-targeted kinase inhibitor, cediranib. Using intravital microscopy, molecular techniques, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we measured survival, tumor growth, edema, vascular morphology and function, cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation, and circulating angiogenic biomarkers. RESULTS: We show by intravital microscopy that cediranib significantly decreased tumor vessel permeability and diameter. Moreover, cediranib treatment induced normalization of perivascular cell coverage and thinning of the basement membrane, as mirrored by an increase in plasma collagen IV. These rapid changes in tumor vascular morphology and function led to edema alleviation -- as measured by MRI and by dry/wet weight measurement of water content -- but did not affect tumor growth. By immunohistochemistry, we found a transient decrease in macrophage infiltration and significant but minor changes in tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Systemically, cediranib increased plasma VEGF and placenta growth factor levels, and the number of circulating CXCR4(+)CD45(+) cells. However, by controlling edema, cediranib significantly increased survival of mice in the face of persistent tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Anti-VEGF agents may be able to improve survival of patients with glioblastoma, even without inhibiting tumor growth."

Epub 2009 Jan 30.,Hosseinpour D,J Prosthodont,2009,2009/02/13,,,10.1111/j.1532-849X.2008.00423.x,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to investigate the interaction of water with four different dental impression materials: Aquasil (Ultra XLV Type 3), Take 1 (Wash Regular Set), Genie (Light Body, Standard Set), and Impregum Garant (Soft Light Bodied Consistency). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apparent contact angles of de-ionized water made against thin horizontal sample films of the different materials under different conditions were measured from analysis of profile images of symmetrical sessile drops of water placed on the sample films using a Model FTA200 dynamic drop shape analysis system, which included a JAI M30 high speed CCD camera combined with a zoom microscope. Data were taken for specimens of dry ages (times following mixing) from a minimum of 20 seconds up to 1220 seconds. Imaging was started before the initial water/impression material contact, and lasted for at least 420 seconds in each case. The interval at the beginning of each run was 0.033 second, and then increased by a factor of 1.012 to the end. During the initial 3 seconds following the drop deposition, the drop's shape oscillated due to inertial effects, so apparent contact angle data during this period were neglected in all cases. All measurements were made at room temperature. The drops were enclosed in a humidified chamber that suppressed evaporation. All data were repeated at least five times, and results were analyzed where appropriate using one-way ANOVA. Microscopic images of the water/impression material interactions for fresh (uncured) materials were acquired to reveal the destructive interactions that resulted from such contact. Finally, surface tension measurements were made of water that had been contacted with material of varying dry age using the pendant drop method capability of the drop shape analysis system. These helped to assess the origin of hydrophilicity development for the different materials. RESULTS: For short curing times (dry ages), water showed a destructive effect on the integrity of all of the impression materials, as evidenced by the formation of a crater beneath the water drop and a scum of material at its surface. These effects diminished with dry age until a critical curing time was reached, beyond which such destructive interactions were no longer detectable. These critical curing times were determined to be 80, 140, 110, and 185 seconds for Aquasil, Take 1, Genie, and Impregum, respectively. The initial contact angle following the respective critical curing time was lowest for Impregum, at 66 degrees ; while values for Aquasil, Genie, and Take 1 were 93 degrees , 104 degrees , and 110 degrees , respectively. Beyond the critical curing times for the different materials, different degrees of hydrophilicity were observed. Aquasil showed the lowest final contact angle (<10 degrees ), with Impregum, Take 1, and Genie showing 31 degrees , 34 degrees , and 40 degrees , respectively. Measurements of the surface tension of water after contact with the different materials suggested that for Aquasil, hydrophilicity appears to be developed through the leaching of surfactant from the material, whereas for Impregum, Take 1, and Genie, hydrophilicity is developed at least in part through a change in surface structure in contact with water. Impregum and Aquasil materials of dry ages well beyond the critical curing time exhibited a stick-slip behavior in their interline movement or contact angle evolution. This was believed to be due to the slowness in the leaching of surfactant (in the case of Aquasil) or the re-orientation of unleachable surface groups (in the case of the other materials) in comparison to the inherent kinetics of water drop spreading. CONCLUSIONS: All materials investigated in the fresh, uncured state showed qualitative decomposition when put in contact with water through the formation of a crater beneath the water drop and a scum of material at its surface. These effects diminished with curing time until beyond a critical value, no such effects were evident. The initial hydrophilicity of the materials as determined by the contact angles obtained at their respective critical dry ages was greatest for Impregum. Beyond the critical curing time, different degrees of hydrophilicity were observed, with Aquasil showing the lowest final contact angle."

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of confocal examination of erythematosquamous skin diseases, to define typical RCM-features and assess them for their presence or absence, diagnostic performance and reliability. METHODS: Three independent observers received standardized instructions about diagnostic RCM-features of erythematosquamous skin diseases. A total of 1700 RCM images obtained from 75 patients with psoriasis, contact dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE) or subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and from 10 'healthy adults' without any skin disease were evaluated by each observer. RESULTS: Overall, sensitivity and specificity values as observed by three observers were, respectively, 89.13% and 95.41% for psoriasis; 83.33% and 92.31% for contact dermatitis; 62.96% and 94.53% for SCLE/CDLE; and 63.33% and 92.89% for mycosis fungoides. CONCLUSIONS: Reflectance confocal microscopy examination appears to be a promising method for non-invasive assessment of erythematosquamous skin diseases. This study provides a set of well-described morphological criteria with obvious diagnostic impact, which should be used in further investigations."

It is argued that young coconut juice (YCJ) could have some estrogen-like characteristics, but this is still debatable. Our aim was to investigate this argument, and to examine whether YCJ has any neuroprotective effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of female rats (10 in each group) were included in this study. These included sham-operated, overiectomized (ovx), ovx and receiving estradiol benzoate (EB) injections intraperitoneally, and ovx and receiving YCJ orally. At the end of the five-week study, the rats were sacrificed, and their serum estradiol (E2) level was measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay. Moreover, the rat brains were excised, and the cortical pyramidal neurons were examined using markers of neuronal cell death, namely anti-neurofilament (NF200) and anti-parvalbumin (PV) antibodies. RESULTS: Our results showed that the rat group which received YCJ had its serum E2 level significantly (P<0.05) higher than the ovx group which did not receive any treatment, and the sham-operated group. A similar trend was observed with the group which received EB injections, but no significant difference was present when the latter was compared with the sham-operated group. In addition, a significant reduction in neuronal cell death was observed in the YCJ-treated group, as compared to the ovx group which did not receive any treatment. This was indicated by the significantly (P<0.05) higher number of neurons which were immunopositive for NF200 and PV. Interestingly, the number of these neurons was also significantly (P<0.05) higher in the YCJ group, as compared to the EB group. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the argument that YCJ has estrogen-like characteristics, and it also adds more evidence to the observation that hormonal imbalance could induce some brain pathologies in females."

The remaining group consisted of 10 healthy individuals. Sonograms were compared with standard histologic findings. RESULTS: The sonographic features of normal plantar skin and plantar warts are described, including the shape, echogenicity, pattern of growth, involvement of skin layers, and blood flow in the lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Sonography may be considered as reliable support for plantar wart diagnosis and may have a role in the evaluation of plantar wart treatment modalities, allowing monitoring of therapeutic responses, especially in recurrent and difficult cases with persistent symptoms such as pain."

The in vitro cell transformation assay allows the monitoring of the neoplastic phenotype by foci formation in suitable cells (e.g. C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts) showing aberrant morphology of massive build-up, polar and multi-layered densely stained cells. The classification of transformed foci in C3H cells relies on light microscopy scoring by a trained human expert based on standard rules. This procedure is time-consuming and prone, in some cases, to subjectivity, thereby leading to possible over- or under-estimation of the carcinogenic potential of tested compounds. Herewith we describe the in vitro neoplastic transformation induced by B[a]P and CdCl2, and the development of a foci classifier based on image analysis and statistical classification. The image analysis system, which relies on 'spectrum enhancement', is quantitative and extracts descriptors of foci texture and structure. The statistical classification method is based on the Random Forest algorithm. We obtained a classifier trained by using expert's supervision with a 20% classification error. The proposed method could serve as a basis to automate the in vitro cell transformation assay."

Epub 2008 Jul 15.,Eynard HG,J Surg Res,2009,2008/08/19,,,10.1016/j.jss.2008.06.022,"BACKGROUND: Due to the fact that different biological parameters play a key role in colonic malignant behavior, with nuclear morphometry being a prognostic marker in many malignancies, then predictive approaches in colorectal cancer (CRC) carried out on histologically well-defined groups may prevent interpretative errors. Subsequently, in the present study, CRC patients were screened according to the morphometric features of tumor cell nuclei, using an accurate histotechnical approach, to analyze their clinical evolution according to Dukes' stratification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 66 cases were grouped according to Dukes' classification (5 y of follow-up). The perimeter, nuclear area, and shape factor of 50 interphase carcinoma nuclei were recorded through microphotographs obtained from each subject. Nuclei boundaries were drawn by an electronic pencil and examined by a computerized system. Data were submitted to a variance analysis, and a multi-regression model compared results. RESULTS: The sample was made up of 44 males (66.67%) and 22 females (33.33%) aged 59.7 +/- 6 y old. Forty-nine patients (74.24%) were classified as stage B, and 17 (25.76%) as stage C. Nuclear homogeneity was confirmed by analysis of variance. The nuclear parameters were (mean +/- SD): area (3.17 +/- 1.74), perimeter (6.72 +/- 1.83), and shape factor (0.82 +/- 0.03). A multiple logistic regression model showed that stage C subjects had a higher risk of developing a worse clinical evolution than those at stage B (P < 0.02), independent of sex and age. CONCLUSIONS: Dukes' classification remains the best predictor of evolution. Although nucleomorphometric suitability is still controversial, this technique has become an additional tool to establish CRC prognosis."

Despite histological evidence for brain differences in dyslexia, we recently demonstrated that in large cohort of subjects, no differences between control and dyslexic readers can be found at the macroscopic level (MRI voxel), because of large variances in brain local volumes. In the present study, we aimed at finding brain areas that most discriminate dyslexic from control normal readers despite the large variance across subjects. After segmenting brain grey matter, normalizing brain size and shape and modulating the voxels' content, normal readers' brains were used to build a 'typical' brain via bootstrapped confidence intervals. Each dyslexic reader's brain was then classified independently at each voxel as being within or outside the normal range. We used this simple strategy to build a brain map showing regional percentages of differences between groups. The significance of this map was then assessed using a randomization technique. RESULTS: The right cerebellar declive and the right lentiform nucleus were the two areas that significantly differed the most between groups with 100% of the dyslexic subjects (N = 38) falling outside of the control group (N = 39) 95% confidence interval boundaries. The clinical relevance of this result was assessed by inquiring cognitive brain-based differences among dyslexic brain subgroups in comparison to normal readers' performances. The strongest difference between dyslexic subgroups was observed between subjects with lower cerebellar declive (LCD) grey matter volumes than controls and subjects with higher cerebellar declive (HCD) grey matter volumes than controls. Dyslexic subjects with LCD volumes performed worse than subjects with HCD volumes in phonologically and lexicon related tasks. Furthermore, cerebellar and lentiform grey matter volumes interacted in dyslexic subjects, so that lower and higher lentiform grey matter volumes compared to controls differently modulated the phonological and lexical performances. Best performances (observed in controls) corresponded to an optimal value of grey matter and they dropped for higher or lower volumes. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence for the existence of various subtypes of dyslexia characterized by different brain phenotypes. In addition, behavioural analyses suggest that these brain phenotypes relate to different deficits of automatization of language-based processes such as grapheme/phoneme correspondence and/or rapid access to lexicon entries."

There is no consensus about the criteria for grading and the proportion of anaplastic cells required to classify a tumor as high grade. The incidence and management of heterogeneous tumors (tumors harboring more than 1 histologic grade) are not well established. The purposes of this study were to present a grading model for penile cancer, to test the practicality of the system by comparing a visual (""naked-eye"") estimation of the proportions of grades with a digitally guided measuring system and to determine the influence on nodal metastasis of the various proportions of grades. A total of 117 penectomy and circumcision specimens with bilateral inguinal lymph node dissections were studied and 62 heterogeneous tumors were identified (53%). The following steps were taken: (1) design of a grading system model; (2) determination of proportions of histologic grades by naked-eye evaluation and by digital measurement; (3) evaluation of metastasis according to proportions of grades; (4) determination of the influence of site of grade 3 in nodal metastasis; (5) design of a Gleason-like scoring system; and (6) statistical evaluation. We designed a 3-tier grading system. Grade 1: well-differentiated cells, almost undistinguishable from normal squamous cells except for the presence of minimal basal/parabasal cell atypia. Grade 3: tumors predominantly composed of anaplastic cells. Grade 2: all tumors not fitting into criteria described for grade 1 or 3. A visual and digital-based (slides scanned and the corresponding areas measured with an image-editing software) proportions of grades were estimated and the metastatic rate between them were confronted using different proportions of grade 3. To evaluate the influence of site of grade 3 on nodal metastasis, we selected 20 heterogeneous tumors. We established 3 sites: superficial, at or within the main tumor and deep at front of invasion. There was no significant difference between the visual estimation and the digital measurement systems. Heterogeneous tumors comprised about half of penile squamous cell carcinomas. The majority of the heterogeneous tumors were composed of a combination of grades 2 and 3 (68%). No statistical differences were noted in the incidence of nodal metastasis when comparing tumors with various proportions of anaplastic cells (P>0.10 in all cases). Metastatic rate was significantly more frequent in tumors harboring any proportion of grade 3 as compared with tumors without grade 3 (58% vs. 14%, P=0.04). Any proportion of grade 3 was equally associated with a significant risk of nodal metastasis. A Gleason-like system showed a correlation of higher scores and rate of nodal metastasis. No predictive advantage was found when comparing the Gleason-like model with the proposed 3-tier grading system. The proposed grading system emphasized both ends of the differentiation spectrum and was based on easily recognizable morphologic criteria. When histologically evaluating penile carcinomas, we recommend a careful search of areas of grade 3. Any focus of grade 3 should be sufficient to grade the neoplasm as a high-grade tumor."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy-six patients with 277 lesions, including 15 mucinous carcinomas (13 pure type, two mixed type), 204 other malignant tumors, and 58 benign lesions, were examined with 1.5-T MRI at b values of 0 and 1,500 s/mm(2). The correlations between cellularity and ADC, homogeneity of signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images, and histopathologic findings were analyzed. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The mean ADC of mucinous carcinoma (1.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was statistically higher than that of benign lesions (1.3+/- 0.3 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and other malignant tumors (0.9 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (p < 0.001). The ADC of pure type mucinous carcinoma (1.8 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was higher than that of mixed type mucinous carcinoma (1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (p < 0.001) and other histologic types (p > 0.05). The correlation between mean cellularity and the ADC of mucinous carcinoma was significant (rho(s) = -0.754; p = 0.001). The homogeneity of signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images correlated with the homogeneity of histologic structures of mucinous carcinoma (p < 0.001; kappa = 0.826). CONCLUSION: Mucinous carcinoma can be clearly differentiated from other breast tumors on the basis of ADC. The low signal intensity of mucinous carcinoma on diffusion-weighted images appears to reflect the presence of mucin and low cellularity. High signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images may reflect the presence of fibrovascular bundles, increased cell density, or a combination of these features."

Although it has been established that activators can interact with multiple components of TFIID, it is unknown whether common or distinct surfaces within TFIID are targeted by activators and what changes if any in the structure of TFIID may occur upon binding activators. As a first step toward structurally dissecting activator/TFIID interactions, we determined the three-dimensional structures of TFIID bound to three distinct activators (i.e., the tumor suppressor p53 protein, glutamine-rich Sp1 and the oncoprotein c-Jun) and compared their structures as determined by electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. By a combination of EM and biochemical mapping analysis, our results uncover distinct contact regions within TFIID bound by each activator. Unlike the coactivator CRSP/Mediator complex that undergoes drastic and global structural changes upon activator binding, instead, a rather confined set of local conserved structural changes were observed when each activator binds holo-TFIID. These results suggest that activator contact may induce unique structural features of TFIID, thus providing nanoscale information on activator-dependent TFIID assembly and transcription initiation."

RMCM was performed in 12 patients (aged; 36.2+/-14.2 years, maximum-burn-extent: 4% total body surface area) at times 12, 36, and 72 hours after a superficial burn. The following parameters were assessed: quantitative blood-cell-flow (cbf), epidermal thickness (Emin), basal-layer thickness (tbl), and granular cell-size (Agran). Cbf was found to be 54+/-3.6 cells/minutes (control), increased to 91+/-3.6 cells/minutes (p<0.05) 12 hours postburn; decreased to 71+/-6.1 cells/minutes (p<0.05) (36 hours), and to 63+/-2.3 cells/minutes (p>0.05) 72 hours postburn.

Due to the intrinsic limited sensitivity and operator-dependent variations, there exist high inter- and intraobserver discrepancies. We validate our quantification system, Fibro-C-Index, with a comprehensive animal study and demonstrate its potential application in clinical diagnosis to reduce inter- and intraobserver discrepancies."

Our results show that the combination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and multiphoton excited autofluorescence (MAF) signals may be used to acquire morphological and quantitative information in discriminating cancerous from noncancerous lung tissues. Specifically, noncancerous lung tissues are largely fibrotic in structure, while cancerous specimens are composed primarily of tumor masses. Quantitative ratiometric analysis using MAF to SHG index (MAFSI) shows that the average MAFSI for noncancerous and LAC lung tissue pairs are 0.55+/-0.23 and 0.87+/-0.15, respectively. In comparison, the MAFSIs for the noncancerous and SCC tissue pairs are 0.50+/-0.12 and 0.72+/-0.13, respectively.

METHODS: A total of 8 samples of synovium were obtained from RA patients during surgery, and 8 samples from osteoarthritis (OA) patients were examined as controls. Furthermore, total 14 samples of syovium were obtained for comparison among radiographical classifications as Larsen grade (4 cases of grade III, 5 cases of grade IV and 5 cases of grade V). These specimens were frozen with OCT compound immediately after surgery. Frozen sections were applied to a newly developed gelatin-coated FIZ film (Fuji Film Co.Tokyo.Japan) designed for use ISZ, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 6 hours. Using an image analyzer (image processor for analytical pathology; IPAP), two variables were measured as indicators of in vivo gelatynolytic activity: optical density of gelatinolyzed area (ODG), and ratio of gelatinolyzed area (RGA). Also, we investigated the relationship between these indicators and the following variables: radiographic changes (Larsen grades), clinical data (C-reactive protein concentration), histological score of synovial tissue (modified Rooney's score), and expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 (assessed by immunohistochemistry). RESULTS: RA synovium had significantly higher RGA and lower ODG than OA, indicating higher gelatinolytic activity in RA. Synovium from cases with Larsen grade IV or V had significantly lower ODG than cases with grade III, but there was no significant difference in RGA between grades. There was no significant correlation between gelatinolytic activity (ODG or RGA) and either CRP or modified Rooney's Histological Score. The results of ISZ indicate that the gelatinolyzed areas were mainly localized in the lining area, with a small amount scattered throughout the stroma. The results of immunohistochemistry indicate that MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were expressed in areas of gelatinolysis. CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that in vivo gelatinolytic activity of synovium is stronger in RA than in OA. They also indicate that gelatinolytic activity of RA synovial cells is stronger in cases with Larsen grade IV or V than in cases with grade III, although the gelatinolyzed area is similar. Gelatinolytic activity, as indicated by optical density and the gelatinolyzed area, differed between regions, even within the same specimen, suggesting an imbalance between production of proteinases and their inhibitors. We believe that the present zymography method can contribute to the elucidation of biological enzymatic activity of RA synovium."

Epub 2009 Apr 22.,Dwyer M,J Neurol Sci,2009,2009/04/24,,,10.1016/j.jns.2009.03.016,"Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) provides a reliable and histopathologically validated means for identifying important tissue changes in multiple sclerosis (MS), including demyelination and remyelination. However, most approaches to date have been based on a priori regions of interest (ROIs) and have been relatively insensitive to small focal changes or competing processes. More recent techniques have sought to address this through a voxel-wise approach, but have been limited in their detection capabilities by the amount of noise in standard MTR images. To address this issue while remaining sensitive to local changes, we propose the use of the recently introduced threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) technique in combination with a Monte Carlo estimation approach. TFCE is first applied to enhance individual voxels based on their level of local cluster support, and then Monte Carlo estimation is performed to allow meaningful statistical interpretation of the resulting TFCE values. We validated this technique in three complementary ways: healthy control scan-rescan analysis, analysis of a ""gold standard"" simulated dataset, and analysis of a group of MS patients and healthy volunteers with 1-year longitudinal MRI scans. Scan-rescan analysis demonstrated a very low false-positive rate (1.44 mL increasing and 1.48 mL decreasing at the optimal detection threshold). Simulated dataset analysis yielded an area under receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.942 (compared to 0.801 for a more conventional voxel-wise thresholding analysis). Finally, analysis of the real subject population showed highly significant differences (p<0.001) in volume of decreasing MTR between patients and controls. The proposed method provides a valuable means for quantifying MS-related tissue changes, particularly demyelination and remyelination, in vivo and without the use of highly complex or experimental MRI acquisition techniques. It improves on the sensitivity of other approaches, and may increase the statistical power of studies investigating the effects of therapy on MRI outcomes in MS."

Histology was performed to classify the tissue samples as healthy adipose tissue, healthy fibrous breast tissue, or breast cancers. The average complex refractive index was determined for each group and it was found that samples containing cancer had a higher refractive index and absorption coefficient. The terahertz properties of the tissues were also used to simulate the impulse response functions expected when imaging breast tissue in a reflection geometry as in terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI). Our results indicate that both TPS and TPI can be used to distinguish between healthy adipose breast tissue, healthy fibrous breast tissue and breast cancer due to the differences in the fundamental optical properties."

Existing prostate biopsy procedures have been mostly focusing on detecting cancer presence. However, they often ignore the potential use of biopsy to estimate cancer volume (CV) and Gleason Score (GS, a cancer grade descriptor), the two surrogate markers for cancer aggressiveness and the two crucial factors for treatment planning. To fill up this vacancy, this paper assumes and demonstrates that, by optimally sampling the spatial patterns of cancer, biopsy procedures can be specifically designed for estimating CV and GS. Our approach combines image analysis and machine learning tools in an atlas-based population study that consists of three steps. First, the spatial distributions of cancer in a patient population are learned, by constructing statistical atlases from histological images of prostate specimens with known cancer ground truths. Then, the optimal biopsy locations are determined in a feature selection formulation, so that biopsy outcomes (either cancer presence or absence) at those locations could be used to differentiate, at the best rate, between the existing specimens having different (high vs. low) CV/GS values. Finally, the optimized biopsy locations are utilized to estimate whether a new-coming prostate cancer patient has high or low CV/GS values, based on a binary classification formulation. The estimation accuracy and the generalization ability are evaluated by the classification rates and the associated receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves in cross validations. The optimized biopsy procedures are also designed to be robust to the almost inevitable needle displacement errors in clinical practice, and are found to be robust to variations in the optimization parameters as well as the training populations."

A Perl scripted MySQL database was used to develop the test editor and test interface. Virtual slides were created with the Aperio ScanScope. The examination consisted of 20 questions using 20 virtual slides. Slides were chosen to represent general surgical pathology specimens from a variety of organ systems. The examination was administered in a secure environment and was completed in 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Examination reliability, as an indicator of the test's ability to discriminate between trainee ability levels, was excellent (r = 0.84). The linear correlation coefficient of virtual slide competency examination score versus months of surgical pathology training was 0.83 (P = .0001). The learning curve was much steeper early in training. Correlation of virtual slide competency examination performance with resident's performance on the 64 item Resident In-Service Examination surgical pathology subsection was 0.70. Correlation of virtual slide competency examination performance with global end of rotation ratings was 0.28. This pilot implementation demonstrates that it is possible to create a short, reliable performance-based assessment tool for measuring morphologic diagnostic skill using a virtual slide competency examination. Furthermore, the examination as implemented in our program will be a valid measure of an individual resident's progress in morphologic competency. Virtual slide technology and computer accessibility have advanced to the point that the virtual slide competency examination model implemented in our program could have applicability across multiple residency programs."

In particular, we investigated the two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) of tryptophan, an essential amino acid serving as the building block of protein. Our findings show that the TPEF of cellular tryptophan produces a good contrast to reveal the morphology of the epithelial cell layer, and the contrast can be further enhanced by applying low-concentration acetic acid."
19584829,High accuracy of narrow band imaging without magnification for the real-time characterization of polyp histology and its comparison with high-definition white light colonoscopy: a prospective study,"Rastogi A, Keighley J, Singh V, Callahan P, Bansal A, Wani S, Sharma P.",Am J Gastroenterol. 2009 Oct;104(10):2422-30. doi: 10.1038/ajg.2009.403. Epub 2009 Jul 7.,Rastogi A,Am J Gastroenterol,2009,2009/07/09,,,10.1038/ajg.2009.403,"OBJECTIVES: Standard white light colonoscopy has limited ability to differentiate between polyp types (adenomatous vs. hyperplastic). Narrow band imaging (NBI) highlights the superficial mucosal/vascular patterns on polyps and may facilitate real-time characterization of polyp histology. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate and compare the diagnostic characteristics of high-definition white light colonoscopy (HDWL) and NBI without magnification in the real-time prediction of polyp histology (adenomatous vs. hyperplastic) by evaluating the surface mucosal and vascular patterns. METHODS: We conducted a prospective comparative study in a tertiary referral center. A total of 100 patients referred for screening or surveillance colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled and underwent colonoscopy using a high-definition colonoscope with NBI capability. Every polyp detected was initially evaluated with HDWL followed by NBI for the presence of surface mucosal/vascular patterns. Based on these patterns, polyp histology was predicted by both modalities. The main outcome measurements were: (i) diagnostic characteristics of HDWL and NBI in predicting polyp histology and (ii) impact of polyp size and learning effect (first half of study vs. second half) on the ability of NBI to predict adenomas. RESULTS: A total of 236 polyps were detected in 100 patients-143 adenomas, 77 hyperplastic, and 16 others. Surface patterns (type A: hyperplastic; type B: adenomatous) were recognized in all polyps with NBI (100%) compared to 45% with HDWL. For predicting adenomas, NBI had a significantly higher sensitivity and greater accuracy (96 and 93% respectively) compared with HDWL (38 and 61% respectively) (all P<0.0001). Although the accuracy of NBI for predicting adenomas improved with increasing polyp size (< or =5 mm; 6-9 mm; > or =10 mm) and in the second half compared with the first half of the study, these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Using a simple surface mucosal/vascular pattern classification, NBI without magnification was highly accurate and significantly superior to HDWL for the real-time prediction of adenomas."

To characterize antigen expression on TMAs, the use of image analysis methods avoids the effects of human subjectivity evidenced in manual microscopical analysis. Thus, these methods have the potential to significantly enhance both precision and reproducibility. Although some commercial systems include tools for the quantitative evaluation of immunohistochemistry-stained images, there exists no clear agreement on best practices to allow for correct and reproducible quantification results. Our study focuses on practical aspects regarding (i) image acquisition (ii) segmentation of staining and counterstaining areas and (iii) extraction of quantitative features. We illustrate our findings using a commercial system to quantify different immunohistochemistry markers targeting proteins with different expression patterns (cytoplasmic, nuclear or membranous) in colon cancer or brain tumor TMAs. Our investigations led us to identify several steps that we consider essential for standardizing computer-assisted immunostaining quantification experiments. In addition, we propose a data normalization process based on reference materials to be able to compare measurements between studies involving different TMAs. In conclusion, we recommend certain critical prerequisites that commercial or in-house systems should satisfy in order to permit valid immunostaining quantification."

To evaluate the prognostic value of CD34 immunostaining of the vessels in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), an automated image analysis method was used. METHOD: In a nationwide study, covering salivary gland cancer (SGC) patients in Finland 1991-1996, 37 AdCC and 18 MEC patients (M 25, F 30, age 25-90, mean 63) were included. In addition to clinical characteristics the size, shape, staining intensity and vessel density in CD34 immunostained histologic samples were measured. RESULTS: Altogether 4433 vessels were measured from AdCC and 2615 from MEC tumor. Of the total tumor vessels measured, 2651 were from patients who deceased with disease (Group I) and 4397 were from specimens derived from those who did not die of disease (Group II) during the 10-year follow-up. The staining intensity was significantly higher in MEC than in AdCC tumor (P = 0.0005). In MEC, the Group I patients had a higher staining intensity among high-grade patients compared with patients with low grade disease, whereas the tumors in Group II had a lower staining intensity among the high-grade compared with the low grade tumors (P = 0.018). A higher vessel density was found in patients with MEC in group II compared with group I (P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The staining intensity of CD34 positive vessels in MEC was higher than in AdCC. In MEC, higher staining intensity of vessels in high-grade tumors and lower vessel density in all MEC patients, predicted poor survival."

Although structural differences in the vessel wall of these patients may be of influence, we hypothesize that a histomorphologic difference in composition and embedding of the fibrous annulus in transposition of the great arteries may play a role in neoaortic root dilatation. METHODS: Two normal human hearts and two unoperated human hearts with transposition of the great arteries, 1 day postnatal, were studied. Histologic sections stained for collagen, myocardium, and elastin were prepared, and three-dimensional reconstructions of the outflow tracts were made to enable comparison of the morphologic structures between the normal hearts and those with transposition of the great arteries. RESULTS: The amount of collagen in the arterial roots was diminished in hearts with transposition of the great arteries compared with the normal hearts. In addition, the anchorage and embedding of both arterial roots in the myocardium was less extensive in transposition of the great arteries. The changed position of the arteries in the malformed hearts results in less support for the roots from the surrounding atrioventricular myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the observed histomorphologic differences in amount of collagen and myocardial support may be an explanation for the neoaortic root dilatation observed after the arterial switch operation. The developmental background of the observed deficient fibrous annulus formation may originate from an epicardial problem."

STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-seven vital mandibular molars that were prospectively collected in vivo were used. The teeth were extracted and then pulp tissue fixed by 10% formalin. The use of different NiTi rotary systems resulted in 3 experimental groups with 20 specimens each: G1: Hero 642; G2: K3; and G3: ProTaper Universal. Afterward, the specimens were histologically prepared and serial 0.5 microm cross-sections were obtained every 0.2 mm from the 1-3 mm apical levels. The remaining pulp tissue was assessed using a morphometric approach. The cross-sectional area of each root canal and remaining pulp tissue were measured (mcirom(2)). Thus, the percentages of remaining pulp tissue area were calculated for each root canal. RESULTS: Overall, the pooled data obtained from all levels revealed a variable amount of remaining pulp tissue for all experimental groups. Remaining pulp tissue existed in every specimen. However, the Kruskal-Wallis H test was unable to show significant differences among the experimental groups (P > .05) for the pooled data from all levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present study did not find a significant difference in the quality of canal debridement between different NiTi rotary systems, because an adequate tapered shape is obtained."

STUDY DESIGN: A simulation-based method was described, with which the degrading effect of microCT artefacts on certain parameters of the observed structure could be determined. Simulations were carried out with polychromatic and monochromatic X-ray source, and a linearization method with a second-order polynomial fit algorithm was used in specific cases to correct the beam hardening artefact. The virtual test object was a half-crown of a tooth with an artificial caries lesion. RESULTS: For simulation with monochromatic X-ray source, the relative error of lesion depth and thickness measurements of the remineralized layer was found to be 1%-2%. For polychromatic X-ray source, and omitting beam hardening correction, the relative error exceeded 6%. After appropriate beam-hardening correction, the relative error of the measurement could be reduced to 1%-2%. CONCLUSION: With the adjustment simulated in this study, microCT having polychromatic X-ray source resulted in the same level of error as with monochromatic source if the linearization method to correct the beam hardening was used. The presented simulation-based method is a useful way to determine artefact-caused distortions for other studies testing objects with different material and geometry."

METHODS: Thirty-three consecutive patients with 36 morphologically abnormal ovarian masses (solid or cystic with papillary excrescences, focally thickened walls, or irregular solid areas) smaller than 10 cm received a microbubble contrast agent intravenously while undergoing pulse inversion harmonic TVS. The following parameters were assessed: presence of contrast enhancement, time to peak enhancement, peak contrast enhancement, half wash-out time, and area under the enhancement curve (AUC). Tumor histologic analysis was used to distinguish benign from malignant ovarian tumors. RESULTS: Twenty-six benign masses and 10 malignancies were studied. Of all examined criteria, an AUC of greater than 787 seconds(-1) was the most accurate diagnostic criterion for ovarian cancer, with 100.0% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity. Additionally, peak contrast enhancement of greater than 17.2 dB (90.0% sensitivity and 98.3% specificity) and half wash-out time of greater than 41.0 seconds (100.0% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity) proved to be useful. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the AUC, peak enhancement, and half wash-out time had the greatest diagnostic accuracy for contrast-enhanced TVS in differentiation between benign and malignant ovarian masses."

A pilot project was initially conducted to study the feasibility of integrating virtual microscopy into a traditional light microscopic lecture and laboratory course. Because of the difficulty of procuring quality calcified and decalcified sections of teeth, slides from the student loan collection in the oral histology block of the course were outsourced for conversion to digital images and placed on DVDs along with a slide viewer. The slide viewer mimicked the light microscope, allowing horizontal and vertical movement and changing of magnification, and, in addition, a feature to capture static images. In a survey, students rated the ease of use of the software, quality of the images, maneuverability of the images, and questions regarding use of the software, effective use of laboratory, and faculty time. Because of the positive support from the students, our entire student loan collection of 153 glass slides was subsequently converted to virtual images and distributed on an Apricorn pocket external hard drive. Students were asked to assess the virtual microscope over a four-year period. As a result of the surveys, light microscopes have been totally eliminated, and microscope exams have been replaced with project slide examinations. In the future, we plan to expand our virtual slides and incorporate computer testing."
19928096,A theoretical study on phase-contrast mammography with Thomson-scattering x-ray sources,"De Caro L, Giannini C, Bellotti R, Tangaro S.",Med Phys. 2009 Oct;36(10):4644-53. doi: 10.1118/1.3213086.,De Caro L,Med Phys,2009,2009/11/26,,,10.1118/1.3213086,"PURPOSE: The x-ray transmitted beam from any material/tissue depends on the complex refractive index (n= 1-delta+ibeta), where delta is responsible for the phase shift and beta is for the beam attenuation. Although for human tissues, the delta cross section is about 1000 times greater than the beta ones in the x-ray energy range from 10 to 150 keV, the gain in breast tumor visualization of phase-contrast mammography (PCM) with respect to absorption contact imaging (AI) is limited by the maximum dose that can be delivered to the patient. Moreover, in-line PC imaging (PCI) is the simplest experimental mode among all available x-ray PCI techniques since no optics are needed. The latter is a fundamental requirement in order to transfer the results of laboratory research into hospitals. Alternative to synchrotron radiation sources, the implementation of relativistic Thomson-scattering (TS) x-ray sources is particularly suitable for hospital use because of their high peak brightness within a relatively compact and affordable system. In this work, the possibility to realize PCM using a TS source in a hospital environment is studied, accounting for the effect of a finite deliverable dose on the PC visibility enhancement with respect to AI. METHODS: The contrast-to-noise ratio of tumor-tissue lesions in PCM has been studied on the bases of a recent theoretical model, describing image contrast formation by means of both wave-optical theory and the mutual coherence formalism. The latter is used to describe the evolution, during wave propagation, of the coherence of the wave field emitted by a TS source. The contrast-to-noise ratio for both PCI and AI has been analyzed in terms of tumor size, beam energy, detector, and source distances, studying optimal conditions for performing PCM. Regarding other relevant factors which could influence ""tumor"" visibility, the authors have assumed simplified conditions such as a spherical shape description of the tumor inclusion, a constant surrounding background, ideal conditions for the calculus of the contrast-to-noise ratio. RESULTS: The results show the possibility to enhance with PCI the signal-to-noise ratio for features in the submillimeter scale. This finding could give PCM a great advantage with respect to AI, opening the possibility to decrease the number of wrong diagnoses before histological exams. The results agree with experimental evidences obtained by Dreossi et al. [D. Dreossi et al., ""The mammography project at the SYRMEP beamline,"" Eur. J. Radiol. 68, S58-S62 (2008)] with real PCM using synchrotron radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The challenging characteristics of TS sources, suitable for PCM, should be fluxes of at least 10(11) photons/s emitted by very small sources of about 10 microm, together with moderate energy spreads (less than 10%) in order to realize both sufficient spatial coherence and enough fluence on the patient, collecting images in reasonable exposure times. These fluxes will be achieved by next generation TS sources which are already under development."

STUDY DESIGN: A histopathologist examined 106 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of low- and high-grade astrocytomas. Interobserver-checked cases were reviewed under a microscope to estimate the accuracy of the conventional glass slide diagnoses. Then cases based on 5 static-digitized images from each patient were diagnosed. Next, the grade of each tumor was assessed based on the set of 5 images and the World Health Organization (WHO) description of 8 histologic characteristics defined as crucial in grading astrocytomas. Finally, an evaluation was made using a custom-designed decision support system. RESULTS: Conventional glass slide diagnosis was 93.9%. Diagnosis based only on the set of 5 images dropped to 81.6%. Diagnosis based on the set of 5 images and the WHO characteristics boosted accuracy to 88.8%. Accuracy improved to 91.8% with the addition of the decision support system. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a telepathology system might be valuable for accurate grade diagnosis of astrocytomas-providing a means for avoiding diagnostic errors-without blocks or slides having to leave the department. This could significantly reduce the overall time and cost of diagnosis."

Epub 2009 Jul 29.,Stockhammer F,Acta Neurochir (Wien),2009,2009/07/30,,,10.1007/s00701-009-0462-7,"PURPOSE: Malignant gliomas are highly infiltrative tumours with a fatal prognosis. F18-fluoroethyl-tyrosine (FET)-positron emission tomography (PET) often reveals a broader extension of these tumours compared with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Complete resection of the contrast-enhancing lesion is aspired. Fluorescence-guided resection using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) improved the extent of resection. In this study, we investigated whether the FET uptake correlates with the extent of resection using 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. METHODS: Thirteen patients who underwent preoperative and postoperative MRI, FET-PET and fluorescence-guided neuronavigated resection were included in this study. The areas in which intraoperative fluorescence terminated the resection were marked. After fusion of PET and MRI, the standardized uptake value (SUV) of FET related to normal brain (SUV(R)) was measured in regions of interest corresponding to resected and remaining tissue, respectively. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined the optimal threshold of the relative SUV anticipating 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. RESULTS: During resection a vivid fluorescence was present in all patients. Histology revealed glioblastomas in 11 cases, an anaplastic astrocytoma in one case and a low-grade astrocytoma in one case. The median FET SUV(R) was higher in areas corresponding to the fluorescent tumour compared with the non-fluorescent normal brain (2.321 vs 1.142, p < 0.0001, t-test). A SUV(R) greater than 1.374 predicted the fluorescence with a sensitivity of 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.94] and a specificity of 0.94 (CI: 0.84-0.99). The area under the ROC curve was 0.9656 (CI: 0.9364-0.9948). CONCLUSIONS: FET uptake predicts the 5-ALA-induced fluorescence in glioma patients. Thus, FET-PET provides useful information for planning glioma resection."

In this study, we analyzed 31 cases of PLCIS (13 apocrine and 18 nonapocrine subtypes) and compared the clinical, pathologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics of these cases with those of 24 cases of CLCIS. Biomarker expression was examined using immunostaining for E-cadherin, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, estrogen, progesterone, androgen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor2, CK5/6, and Ki67. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization to assess the genomic alterations was performed using microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Patients with PLCIS presented with mammographic abnormalities. Histologically, the tumor cells were dyshesive and showed pleomorphic nuclei, and there was often associated necrosis and microcalcifications. All lesions were E-cadherin negative. Compared with CLCIS, PLCIS showed significantly higher Ki67 index, lower estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression, and higher incidence of HER2 gene amplification. The majority of PLCIS and CLCIS demonstrated loss of 16q and gain of 1q. Apocrine PLCIS had significantly more genomic alterations than CLCIS and nonapocrine PLCIS. Although lack of E-cadherin expression and the 16q loss and 1q gain-array-based comparative genomic hybridization pattern support a relationship to CLCIS, PLCIS has clinical, mammographic, histologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features that distinguish it from CLCIS. The histologic features, biomarker profile, and genomic instability observed in PLCIS suggest a more aggressive phenotype than CLCIS. However, clinical follow-up studies will be required to define the natural history and most appropriate management of these lesions."

The current standard of quantification of hepatic steatosis is microscopic evaluation by pathologists, although consistency in such assessment remains unclear. Computerized image analysis is an alternative method for objective assessment of the degree of hepatic steatosis. METHODS: High resolution images of hematoxylin and eosin stained liver sections from 46 consecutive patients, initially diagnosed with liver steatosis, were blindly assessed by 4 established expert pathologists from different institutions. Computerized analysis was carried out simultaneously on the same sections. Interobserver agreement and correlation between the pathologists' and computerized assessment were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Spearman rank correlation coefficients, or descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Poor agreement among pathologists (ICC: 0.57) was found regarding the assessment of total steatosis, (ICC >0.7 indicates acceptable agreement). Pathologists' estimation of micro- and macrosteatosis disclosed also poor correlation (ICC: 0.22, 0.55, respectively). Inconsistent assessment of histological features of steatohepatitis (lobular inflammation, portal inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and Mallory hyaline) was documented. Poor conformity was also shown between the computerized quantification and ratings of 3 pathologists (Spearman rank correlation coefficients: 0.22, 0.82, 0.28, and 0.38). CONCLUSION: Quantification of hepatic steatosis in histological sections is strongly observer-dependent, not reproducible, and does not correlate with the computerized estimation. Current standards of assessment, previously published data and the clinical relevance of hepatic steatosis for liver surgery and transplantation must be challenged."

The technique has been modified by several authors, and some have used computer-assisted image analysis. Undecalcified bone sections used in these methods are obtained with a diamond wafer saw or by grinding the sections manually or automatically with abrasive paper. In the present study, we examined the application of histomorphometry to decalcified bone sections, routinely obtained in every pathology lab, from paraffin blocks cut with a standard microtome. This study was divided into two parts: in the first, we tested different decalcifying methods to determine the most appropriate for femoral bone; in the second part, we used computer-assisted histomorphometry to estimate age at death in 29 samples of femoral bone. We measured intact osteon density (N.On), fragmented osteon density (N.On.Fg) and percentage of lamellar bone surface per unit area (Lm.B.Ar) in the cortex of the femoral midshaft, on four or 20 fields per section. We found that 20% nitric acid solution at room temperature proved to be the best decalcifying method, with a mean decalcification duration of 1 week. Fragmented osteon density was found to be the morphometric feature most closely correlated with age, followed by intact osteon density; Lm.B.Ar. did not increase accuracy. The best accuracy (4.1 +/- 3.5 years) was obtained for individuals under the age of 70 when measurements of 20 fields were used for the analysis. For all individuals, the inaccuracy was 6.1 +/- 6.2 years and 8.1 +/- 8 years, with 20 and four fields respectively. The present study shows that decalcification of bone sections can be used for age estimation at death. This procedure is particularly useful in case of mass disaster as it is easily done in any pathology department."

METHODS: The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated in the test group (n = 41), and the sham control group did not have ligation (n = 7). The rats were examined with 10- to 22-MHz echocardiography to evaluate the MI size, location, and geometric formation. RESULTS: The endocardial chamber shape was deformed, with enlargement of the anteroposterior dimension and fractional shortening, and was comparable with the degree of MI both in short- and long-axis sections of the left ventricle. Histologic analysis showed remodeling to different extents corresponding to different MI sizes (small, medium, and large).

Epub 2009 May 26.,Yu J,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2009,2009/05/29,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2009.04.013,"In many applications of medical image analysis, the density of an object is the most important feature for isolating an area of interest (image segmentation). In this research, an object density-based image segmentation methodology is developed, which incorporates intensity-based, edge-based and texture-based segmentation techniques. The proposed method consists of three main stages: preprocessing, object segmentation and final segmentation. Image enhancement, noise reduction and layer-of-interest extraction are several subtasks of preprocessing. Object segmentation utilizes a marker-controlled watershed technique to identify each object of interest (OI) from the background. A marker estimation method is proposed to minimize over-segmentation resulting from the watershed algorithm. Object segmentation provides an accurate density estimation of OI which is used to guide the subsequent segmentation steps. The final stage converts the distribution of OI into textural energy by using fractal dimension analysis. An energy-driven active contour procedure is designed to delineate the area with desired object density. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 98% accurate in segmenting synthetic images. Segmentation of microscopic images and ultrasound images shows the potential utility of the proposed method in different applications of medical image processing."

Manual histological grading of FL is subject to remarkable inter- and intra-reader variations. A promising approach to grading is the development of a computer-assisted system that improves consistency and precision. Correlating information from adjacent slides with different stain types requires establishing spatial correspondences between the digitized section pair through a precise non-rigid image registration. However, the dissimilar appearances of the different stain types challenges existing registration methods. This study proposes a method for the automatic non-rigid registration of histological section images with different stain types. This method is based on matching high level features that are representative of small anatomical structures. This choice of feature provides a rich matching environment, but also results in a high mismatch probability. Matching confidence is increased by establishing local groups of coherent features through geometric reasoning. The proposed method is validated on a set of FL images representing different disease stages. Statistical analysis demonstrates that given a proper feature set the accuracy of automatic registration is comparable to manual registration."

The aim of this study was to investigate the major histopathological characteristics of LR and determine whether the histopathology of LR is more common in whitish areas or in the erythematous areas. METHODS: A clinical survey was carried out that included 16 patients with LR. The histopathological features were investigated with immunostains for factor VIII-related antigen, as well as routine hematoxylin-eosin. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in thrombi, arterial obliteration, or RBC aggregates between the central blanched area and the peripheral erythematous areas. The computer-assisted image analyses of factor VIII-related antigen-stained sections revealed no significant difference in the number of dermal blood vessels and telangiectasia between the areas studied. There were nine cases that showed one or more of the histopathological features of LR in either the central blanched areas or the peripheral erythematous areas. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that multiple punch biopsies should be performed in patients suspected of LR including both the peripheral erythematous and central whitish areas to increase the diagnostic yield."

All but nine of these sectioned specimens showed signs of a bony connection between the long process of the incus and the flattened plate of the lenticular process, and in 108 specimens a complete bony attachment was observed in a single 20 microm section. In these 108 ears, the bony lenticular process consisted of a proximal narrow ""pedicle"" connected to a distal flattened ""plate"" that forms the incudal component of the incudo-stapedial joint. A fibrous joint capsule extended from the stapes head to the pedicle of the lenticular process on all sides, where it was considerably thickened. Three-dimensional reconstructions made from serial 20 microm sections of four bones provided views from all directions that easily convey the anatomical features of this region. Morphometric measurements of the bony architecture of the distal incus in 103 temporal bones were made, including lengths and cross-sectional areas, estimates of the percentage of lacunae containing osteocytes, and the degree of bone resorption. These measurements, analyzed as a function of age, provided an anatomic description over a large age range that can serve as a normal baseline against which structural pathology can be compared. Although none of the bony dimensions showed significant age dependence, the estimated percentage of bony lacunae that contain osteocytes decreased significantly with age. The results have implications for the roles of specific components on the coupling of ossicular motion across the incudo-stapedial joint, and provide insights regarding bone resorption at the level of the distal incus, which occurs clinically in some patients with chronic otitis media or after stapedectomy."

In this study segmentation and classification of sub-epithelial connective tissue (SECT) cells except endothelial cells in oral mucosa of normal and OSF conditions has been reported. Segmentation has been carried out using multi-level thresholding and subsequently the cell population has been classified using support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. Moreover, the geometric features used here have been observed to be statistically significant, which enhance the statistical learning potential and classification accuracy of the classifier. Automated classification of SECT cells characterizes this precancerous condition very precisely in a quantitative manner and unveils the opportunity to understand OSF related changes in cell population having definite geometric properties. The paper presents an automated classification method for understanding the deviation of normal structural profile of oral mucosa during precancerous changes."

Thirty-seven hyperplastic lesions, 42 adenomas and 26 carcinomas from 105 patients were studied. Three morphometric characteristics were evaluated in lesions and normal mucosal surface area from each case: pit counts per area, pit diameter and pit area. RESULTS: Pit counts per area and pit area of lesions as compared to the normal mucosa of the same cases showed statistically significant differences in the 3 groups of lesions studied (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Real-time morphometric evaluation is feasible during videocolonoscopy with magnification roughly equivalent to a 5x microscopic field. Automated evaluation of morphometric characteristics as part of Bayesian Belief Network software may prove a useful information source for the colonoscopist's diagnostic decision."

One of the reasons is that the procedure is intimately dependent on the surgeon's skill for suturing identical stitches. In order to evaluate the influence of the irregularity on suturing for the residual astigmatism, a prototype for ophthalmic surgical support has been developed. The final intention of this prototype is to be an evaluation tool for guided suture and as an outcome diminish the postoperative astigmatism. METHODS: The system consists of hand held ring with 36 infrared LEDs, that is to be projected onto the lachrymal film of the cornea. The image is reflected back through the optics of the ocular microscope and its distortion from the original circular shape is evaluated by developed software. It provides keratometric and circularity measurements during surgery in order to guide the surgeon for uniformity in suturing. RESULTS: The system is able to provide up to 23D of astigmatism (32D - 55D range) and is +/- 0.25D accurate. It has been tested in 14 volunteer patients intraoperative and has been compared to a commercial keratometer Nidek Oculus Hand-held corneal topographer. The correlation factors are 0.92 for the astigmatism and 0.97 for the associated axis. CONCLUSION: The system is potentially efficient for guiding the surgeon on uniformity of suturing, presenting preliminary data indicating an important decrease on the residual astigmatism, from an average of 8D - for patients not submitted to the prototype guidance - to 1.4D - for patients who have actually been submitted to the prototype guidance - after the first 24 hours post-surgery and in the subsequent weeks. It also indicates that the surgeon should achieve circularity greater or equal to 98% in order to avoid postoperative astigmatisms over 1D. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CAAE - 0212.0.004.000-09."

The system first reduces image-to-image variations by means of color normalization. We then construct a database which consists of typical cancer images. The color parameters extracted from this database are then used in automated online sampling from oral cancer images. Principal component analysis is subsequently used to divide the color features into four tissue types. Each pixel in the cancer image is then classified into the corresponding tissue types based on the Mahalanobis distance. The aforementioned procedures are all fully automated; in particular, the automated sampling step greatly reduces the need for intensive labor in manual sampling and training. Experiments reveal high levels of consistency among the results achieved using the manual, semiautomatic, and fully automatic methods. Parameter comparisons between the four cancer stages are conducted, and only the mean parameters between early and late cancer stages are statistically different. In summary, the proposed system provides a useful and convenient tool for automatic segmentation and evaluation for stained biopsy samples of oral cancer. This tool can also be modified and applied to other tissue images with similar staining conditions."

In this study, the morphometrical modifications in the diabetic parotid sialosis were determined to compare them with the histopathological characteristics of alcoholic parotid sialosis. METHODS: Five parotid biopsy samples obtained from patients with diabetic sialosis, 12 samples from patients with alcoholic sialosis and seven from individuals without these pathologies (control group) were analyzed. A morphometrical study of parotid parenchyme and stroma, using a digital image analyzer attached to an optical microscope, was carried out. Dimensions of serous acini and striated ducts, the area occupied by the fatty tissue, and the number of ducts were recorded. Mean values were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test (P <or= 0.05). RESULTS: The variables analyzed in diabetic patients did not show significant differences with respect to the control group. However, when diabetics were compared with alcoholics, the alcoholics exhibited a noticeable reduction in the proportion of fatty tissue of stroma and a significant development of ductal epithelium that contributed to increase the caliber of the striated ducts. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the glandular hypertrophy in the diabetic parotid sialosis is not directly associated with the ductal and acinar size, amount of fatty tissue and ductal hyperplasy. Nevertheless, these findings show that the ductal dimensions and the proportion of adipose tissue are variables that allow us to establish histopathological differences between diabetic and alcoholic sialosis."

Microscopic images from anti-IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and fibrinogen stained sections were collected to a computer; 292 direct immunofluorescence images from 72 patients. The FFNN training set included 192 images from 32 patients. SDIC values and a possibility range for PDI category suggested by an experienced pathologist were transferred to FFNN for training. SDIC values were analyzed statistically according to PDI. After the training phase, for determining the accuracy of automatic self-decision process, 100 images from 40 cases were analyzed by FFNN proposing the possibility of PDI. SDIC values were significantly different for PDI groups (1-way ANOVA; P < 0.001) whereas SDIC values of epidermal intercellular group were different from others. FFNN predicted the correct PDI as the first possibility in 83% and second possibility in 14% of the cases. Direct immunofluorescence SDIC measurements processed by FFNN may help inexperienced pathologists in future."

The evaluation of the second harmonic to autofluorescence aging index of dermis (SAAID) has allowed a first characterization of tissues by scoring the collagen/elastin content. Further analyses on collagen morphology in healthy dermis and keloids were performed by image-pattern analysis of SHG images. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) analysis method has allowed classification of different tissues based on the evaluation of geometrical arrangement of collagen fibrillar bundles, whereas a pattern analysis of the FFT images has allowed the discrimination of different tissues based on the anisotropy of collagen fibers distribution. This multiple scoring method represents a promising tool to be extended to other collagen disorders, as well as to be used in in-vivo skin-imaging applications."

METHODS: Ninety-nine nonpalpable breast masses (79 benign and 20 malignant) in 94 women (mean age, 45 years; range, 21-68 years) who had been scheduled for a sonographically guided core biopsy were examined with B-mode sonography and sonoelastography. Radiologists who had performed the biopsies analyzed the B-mode sonograms and provided American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categories. The strain index (fat to lesion strain ratio) was calculated by dividing the strain value of the subcutaneous fat by that of the mass. The histologic result from the sonographically guided core biopsy was used as a reference standard. The diagnostic performance of the strain index and that of B-mode sonography were compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The mean strain index values +/- SD were 6.57 +/- 6.62 (range, 1.29-28.69) in malignant masses and 2.63 +/- 4.57 (range, 0.54-38.76) in benign masses (P = .019). The area under the ROC curve values were 0.835 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.747-0.902) for B-mode sonography and 0.879 (95% CI, 0.798-0.936) for the strain index (P = .490). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 95% (19 of 20), 75% (59 of 79), 48% (19 of 39), and 98% (59 of 60), respectively, when a best cutoff point of 2.24 was used. CONCLUSIONS: The strain index based on the fat to lesion strain ratio has diagnostic performance comparable with that of B-mode sonography for differentiation of benign and malignant breast masses."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gray matter or white matter concentrations of 16 left and 15 right mTLE patients who achieved an excellent surgical outcome were compared with those of 24 healthy volunteers for the left group and with 23 healthy volunteers for the right group, by optimized voxel-based morphometry using unmodulated and modulated images. A histologic count of heterotopic neurons was obtained in the white matter of the anterior temporal lobe originating from the patients' surgical specimens. In addition, the number of heterotopic neurons were tested to determine if there was a correlation with the GMC or WMC. RESULTS: The GMCs of the left and right mTLE groups were reduced in the ipsilateral hippocampi, bilateral thalami, precentral gyri, and in the cerebellum. The WMCs were reduced in the ipsilateral white matter of the anterior temporal lobe, bilateral parahippocampal gyri, and internal capsules, but increased in the pons and bilateral precentral gyri. The heterotopic neuron counts in the left mTLE group showed a positive correlation (r = 0.819, p < 0.0001) with GMCs and a negative correlation (r = -0.839, p < 0.0001) with WMCs in the white matter of the anterior temporal lobe. CONCLUSION: The present study shows the abnormalities of the cortico-thalamo-hippocampal network including a gray matter volume reduction in the anterior frontal lobes and an abnormality of brain tissue concentration in the pontine area. Furthermore, heterotopic neuron numbers were significantly correlated with GMC or WMC in the left white matter of anterior temporal lobe."

It is well documented that pre-existing atypical or dysplastic nevi can evolve into a melanoma. The development of an in vivo imaging system to characterize benign and malignant nevi has been emphasized to aid in early detection of melanoma. The goal of this study is to utilize a novel Stokes polarimetry imaging (SPI) system for the characterization of pigmented lesions, and to evaluate the SPI system in comparison to dermoscopy and histology images. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Linearly polarized light with varying incident polarization angles (IPA) illuminated various types of pigmented lesions. The melanocytic nesting patterns of pigmented lesions were characterized by constructing the degree-of-linear-polarization (DOLP) image map with comparison to dermoscopy and histology. The incident polarized light was filtered by visible filters for spectral imaging and incident deeply penetrating red light was used to correlate the SPI image with histopathological examination. RESULTS: The DOLP images with varying IPA at different visible wavelengths were used to characterize various kinds of pigmented lesions by showing subsurface melanocytic nesting distribution as well as morphological information with better resolution and contrast. In correlation with dermoscopy and histology, various defining features such as compound, junctional, lentiginous, reticular, globular patterns of melanocytic nests were identified. CONCLUSION: When imaging pigmented melanocytic lesions, the SPI system with varying IPA at the red light wavelength can better define the melanocytic nesting patterns in both the dermal epidermal junction and the dermis. The SPI system has the potential to be an effective in vivo method of detecting pre-malignant nevi and melanoma."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty three oral submucous fibrosis cases were analyzed morpometrically using an interactive image analysis system in the Department of Pathology, M.L.N Medical College, Allahabad, U.P, India. Paraffin embedded sections of 3-4 microm thickness were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Van Gieson's picric acid and acid fuchsin stain and Masson's trichrome stains. Image analysis was performed with specific software (Image Pro Plus 6.0) and data obtained were finally transported to Excel sheets for calculation of average values for each parameter. RESULTS: With the grading criteria applied, 9 cases of OSMF were grade I, 32 grade II, 39 grade III and 3 grade IV. Clinical trismus was most frequent in Grade IV followed by Grade III, II and I respectively. OSMF Grade I cases did not show any measurable amount of collagenization, whereas it showed a significant increase with OSMF I and II grades [Pearson's chi2 test= 85.72; p= 0.051] and OSMF-III and IV [Pearson's chi2 test=188.74; p<0.001]. Numbers of endothelial cells per low power field consistently decreased with the increasing grade. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that mean blood vessel area and the mean vessel diameter showed a marked increase in grade II and a marker decrease in grade IV and the grade III, collagen thickness (mum) increases according to increasing grade while density of endothelial cells decreases."

This paper presents an automated method for detecting nerve-fibres from CCM images using a dual-model detection algorithm and compares the performance to well-established texture and feature detection methods. The algorithm comprises two separate models, one for the background and another for the foreground (nerve-fibres), which work interactively. Our evaluation shows significant improvement (p approximately 0) in both error rate and signal-to-noise ratio of this model over the competitor methods. The automatic method is also evaluated in comparison with manual ground truth analysis in assessing diabetic neuropathy on the basis of nerve-fibre length, and shows a strong correlation (r = 0.92). Both analyses significantly separate diabetic patients from control subjects (p approximately 0)."

State-of-the-art region-based active contour (RAC) models assume that every spatial location in the image is statistically independent of the others, thereby ignoring valuable contextual information. To address this shortcoming we incorporate a MRF prior into the AC model, further generalizing Chan & Vese's (CV) and Rousson and Deriche's (RD) AC models. This incorporation requires a Markov prior that is consistent with the continuous variational framework characteristic of active contours; consequently, we introduce a continuous analogue to the discrete Potts model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MaRACel, we compare its performance to those of the CV and RD AC models in the following scenarios: (1) the qualitative segmentation of a cancerous lesion in a breast DCE-MR image and (2) the qualitative and quantitative segmentations of prostatic acini (glands) in 200 histopathology images. Across the 200 prostate needle core biopsy histology images, MaRACel yielded an average sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 71%, 95%, 74% with respect to the segmented gland boundaries; the CV and RD models have corresponding values of 19%, 81%, 20% and 53%, 88%, 56%, respectively."

Implicit features of morphology, such as contour smoothness or perimeter-to-area ratio, have been used in the context of computerized decision support classifiers to aid disease diagnosis. These features are usually specific to the domain and application (e.g., margin irregularity is a predictor of malignant breast lesions on DCE-MRI). In this paper we present a framework for extracting Diffeomorphic Based Similarity (DBS) features to capture subtle morphometric differences between shapes that may not be captured by implicit features. Object morphology is represented using the medial axis model and objects are compared by determining correspondences between medial axis models using a cluster-based diffeomorphic registration scheme. To visualize and classify morphometric differences, a manifold learning scheme (Graph Embedding) is employed to identify nonlinear dependencies between medial axis model similarity and calculate DBS. We evaluated our DBS on two clinical problems discriminating: (a) different Gleason grades of prostate cancer using gland morphology on a set of 102 images, and (b) benign and malignant lesions on 44 breast DCE-MRI studies. Precision-recall curves demonstrate DBS features are better able to classify shapes belonging to the same class compared to implicit features. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes utilizing DBS. SVM accuracy was 83 +/- 4.47% for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions on breast DCE-MRI and over 80% in distinguishing between intermediate Gleason grades of prostate cancer on digitized histology."

A small subgroup of glioblastomas contains areas with histological features of oligodendroglial differentiation (GBMO). Our objective was to genetically characterize the oligodendroglial and the astrocytic parts of GBMOs and correlate morphologic and genetic features with clinical data. METHODS: The oligodendroglial and the ""classic"" glioblastoma parts of 13 GBMO were analyzed separately by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin sections using a custom probe set (regions 1p, 1q, 7q, 10q, 17p, 19q, cen18, 21q) and by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of microdissected paraffin embedded tumor tissue. RESULTS: We identified four distinct genetic subtypes in 13 GBMOs: an ""astrocytic"" subtype (9/13) characterized by +7/-10; an ""oligodendroglial"" subtype with -1p/-19q (1/13); an ""intermediate"" subtype showing +7/-1p (1/13), and an ""other"" subtype having none of the former aberrations typical for gliomas (2/13). The different histological tumor parts of GBMO revealed common genetic changes in all tumors and showed additional aberrations specific for each part. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the monoclonal origin of GBMO followed by the development of the astrocytic and oligodendroglial components. The diagnostic determination of the genetic signatures may allow for a better prognostication of the patients."

Among these uses, predicting the extent or existence of tumor cell invasion into white matter by DTI is under extensive investigation. The previously reported tumor infiltration index (TII) holds great potential for the discrimination of pure vasogenic edema from tumor-infiltrated edema. However, conflicting data are being reported questioning the clinical value of TII. The present investigation reevaluated the utility of TII in patients with meningioma or glioma. We found that TII was unable to discriminate vasogenic from tumor-infiltrated edema. Conversely, detailed voxel-by-voxel comparison of TII and (11)C-methionie PET in the T2-hyperintense area of gliomas showed that TII and (11)C-methionie PET has a positive correlation, suggesting that, although TII is unable to discriminate the cause of edema, the extent of tumor cell invasion into white matter is depicted in gliomas by TII. These data suggest that TII involves both vasogenic and tumor-infiltrated factors, rather than only a single factor. A more intensive investigation is required to reach a complete understanding of TII."

BACKGROUND: Laser irradiation can be used for dentinal tubule exposure, smear layer removal, and disinfection. Another potential, interesting application is as an adjunct to endodontic treatment, especially in the intracanal medication phase. METHODS: Fifty-two single-rooted teeth had their crowns sectioned at the cementoenamel junction and were randomly divided into four groups (n = 13): G1: conventional preparation (CP) + irrigation with EDTA-T + rhodamine B dye solution associated with NDP (dexamethasone phosphate, paramonochlorophenol, polyethylenoglycol) (Rhod-NDP); G2: CP + EDTA-T + Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation 0.75 W + Rhod-NDP; G3: CP + EDTA-T + Er,Cr:YSGG 1.5 W + Rhod-NDP; G4: CP + EDTA-T + Er,Cr:YSGG 2.5 W + Rhod-NDP. For the permeability analysis (n = 9), teeth were transversely cut and two slices of each third were selected. The images were analyzed by ImageLab software (Softium Informatica Ltda., Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil). Additional samples (n = 4) were examined by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Data were analyzed statistically using the Kruskal-Wallis and Student-Newman-Keuls tests for the following areas: apical third (H = 23.4651): G1 (14.25)(a), G2 (17.66)(ab), G3 (26.50)(b), G4 (39.58)(c); medium (H = 23.1611): G1 (14.16)(a), G2 (16.66)(ab), G3 (28.83)(b), G4 (38.33)(b); and cervical (H = 32.4810): G1 (9.66)(a), G2 (20. 00)(ab), G3 (27.00)(b), G4 (41.33)(c), (p < 0.01). Despite the irregular aspect of laser irradiation along the canal walls, the parameters of 1.5 W and 2.5 W allowed morphologic modifications that increased dentinal permeability. CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation with Er,Cr:YSGG laser could be effective in endodontic treatment for increasing dentinal permeability."

Epub 2009 Nov 11.,Engelhorn T,Acad Radiol,2010,2009/11/14,,,10.1016/j.acra.2009.08.014,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare tumor signal and contrast media uptake characteristics on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences at 3 Tesla over 30 minutes after double-dose administration of different contrast agents in an animal model of brain glioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine rats underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after stereotactic F98 glioma cell implantation before and repetitively for 30 minutes after injection of gadobutrol, gadopentetate, and gadobenate, respectively. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were evaluated and MRI-derived tumor volumes were compared to histology. RESULTS: Postcontrast tumor SNR and CNR peaked at 4 minutes after contrast application. While contrast-enhancement within the tumor was fading, tumor volume increased by continuous contrast-uptake of peripheral parts between 4 minutes (137 + or - 29 mm(3), 126 + or - 16 mm(3), 141 + or - 24 mm(3)) and 20 minutes (182 + or - 35 mm(3), 164 + or - 32 mm(3), 191 + or - 25 mm(3)), respectively. At 8 and 12 minutes, 84% and 91% of the tumor volume were definable, respectively. CONCLUSION: Optimal correlation between MRI-derived tumor volume and histology is achieved by imaging up to 20 minutes after contrast application. At 4 minutes (this delay is mostly used in clinical routine), only 75% of the enhancing tumor volume is assessable. A delay of 8 minutes already reveals 84% of the tumor and seems to be a practical clinical compromise."

Clinical confocal imaging applications have emerged, including assessment of colonic mucosal dysplasia during colonoscopy. We present our initial experience with handheld, miniaturized confocal imaging in a murine brain tumor model. METHODS: Twelve C57/BL6 mice were implanted intracranially with 10(5) GL261 glioblastoma cells. The brains of 6 anesthetized mice each at 14 and 21 days after implantation were exposed surgically, and the brain surface was imaged using a handheld confocal probe affixed to a stereotactic frame. The probe was moved systematically over regions of normal and tumor-containing tissue. Intravenous fluorescein and topical acriflavine contrast agents were used. Biopsies were obtained at each imaging site beneath the probe and assessed histologically. Mice were killed after imaging. RESULTS: Handheld confocal imaging produced exquisite images, well-correlated with corresponding histologic sections, of cellular shape and tissue architecture in murine brain infiltrated by glial neoplasm. Reproducible patterns of cortical vasculature, as well as normal gray and white matter, were identified. Imaging effectively distinguished between tumor and nontumor tissue, including infiltrative tumor margins. Margins were easily identified by observers without prior neuropathology training after minimum experience with the technology. CONCLUSION: Miniaturized handheld confocal imaging may assist neurosurgeons in detecting infiltrative brain tumor margins during surgery. It may help to avoid sampling error during biopsy of heterogeneous glial neoplasms, with the potential to supplement conventional intraoperative frozen section pathology. Clinical trials are warranted on the basis of these promising initial results."
20093344,Cancellous bone volume is an indicator for trabecular bone connectivity in dialysis patients,"Kazama JJ, Koda R, Yamamoto S, Narita I, Gejyo F, Tokumoto A.",Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2010 Feb;5(2):292-8. doi: 10.2215/CJN.04150609.

The system measures cancellous bone volume (BV/TV) as a third major evaluation axis; however, the physiologic significance of BV/TV remains unclear. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Conventional bone histomorphometry was performed in 75 iliac bone samples obtained from dialysis patients. In 47 of the 75 samples, the remaining samples were subjected to direct microfocus x-ray computed tomographic observation. Quantitative morphologic examinations, including micro-bone mineral densitometry, and marrow space star volume, Euler number, and node-strut analyses, were performed in the virtual three-dimensional space reconstructed from the microfocus x-ray computed tomographic images. RESULTS: The levels of BV/TV were comparable in each of the conventional bone histomorphometric criteria. No significant correlations were found between BV/TV and other parameters. Two- and three-dimensional BV/TVs were significantly correlated with cancellous bone mass but not with cortical bone thickness or cortical bone mass. Two- and three-dimensional BV/TVs were significantly correlated with trabecular bone connectivity as determined by marrow space star volume, Euler number, and node-strut analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In dialysis patients, BV/TV is not dependent on bone turnover or bone mineralization. BV/TV is unlikely to indicate the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Instead, it reflects trabecular bone connectivity, and improved trabecular bone connectivity is physiologically beneficial in terms of bone quality. The turnover-mineralization-volume system offers an advantage over the conventional system for the assessment of bone quality."

Morphology-based simulations at histological scale may one day be used to help the surgeon predict the possible outcome of a variety of approaches. It however can be a challenge to generate volume meshes that are applicable to the mathematical modelling of three-dimensional spatial modifications. Computation of surface meshes may be considered less delicate. The aim of this study is to design and evaluate a novel algorithm that supports finite element methods. Images of histological serial sections of a striated muscle were segmented. Results of the three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple layers of the polygonal segmentation data characterized the hull of the muscle. The corresponding surface mesh was then converted into a tetrahedral mesh to generate volume. This was achieved by mapping multiple template types onto neighbouring intersection polygons. Muscle contraction was subsequently simulated by mesh deformation. The technique successfully generated volumes and was able to provide data on contraction directions. The mesh supported a novel approach to simulate representations of contraction. However, several drawbacks were evident. Mathematical modelling of scenarios with more than one striated muscle will require considerable modification of the currently presented approach. Future studies need to then evaluate the applicability of volume meshes to represent arrays of three-dimensional biological objects. Surface mesh based mathematical modelling of cleft lip and palate surgery and its results are therefore not yet in reach."

We report the clinical feature, histological, and immunophenotypic characteristics of 19 cases of OM diagnosed between 2002 and 2007. The characteristic histologic appearance of OM is sometimes difficult to grasp because of 3 main factors: the anatomic particularities of the nail apparatus, the often fragmented aspect of the tissue specimen, and the choice of the section planes, which strongly modified the morphologic appearances observed. To prevent these difficulties, we built a tridimensional model using serial, transverse, and longitudinal sections. This reconstitution gives us a better understanding of the apparent diversity of the morphologic aspects observed in linking them to the anatomic site of the tumor. OM of the matrix is characterized by a thick nail plate with porch roof. OM of the ventral aspect of the proximal nail fold (PNF) is characterized by a nail plate without porch roof, exhibiting either a woodworm-like appearance or multiple cavities. In this second category, the fibrous base becomes elongated in shape, taking the shape of the anatomic contour of the PNF. The stroma gives rise to numerous fibroepithelial digitations. This pattern is different from the classical OM visualized in longitudinal sections, which appears as a single and large fibroepithelial tumor, that is, the multiple distal epithelial digitations arranged along a transversal plane are not seen. In the PNF variant, the characteristic clinical signs of OM fail to appear. We individualize 3 misleading clinical variants: tumor with a verrucous surface that is located in the lateral nail fold, as a band pattern suggesting wart or Bowen disease; a total dystrophy of the nail unit mimicking a squamous cell carcinoma; and pseudofibrokeratoma type. In the OM located on the ventral matrix, 3 new specific histologic variants were noted: pleomorphic OM, OM with a predominantly collagenous stroma, and superficial acral fibromyxoma-;like OM. OM is a benign tumor with a broader morphologic spectrum than previously thought. When the nail plate is not available, the immunohistochemistry can aid diagnosis by highlighting the peculiar immunophenotyping of OM, which expresses CD34 but not CD99, epithelial membrane antigen, S-100 protein, actin, and desmin."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients who underwent TACE within 90 days of liver transplantation and CE MRI scans were assessed by two independent observers who determined the percentage of tumor necrosis using nonsubtracted and subtracted postcontrast phases. Histopathologic percentage of necrosis was retrospectively determined by an experienced pathologist. Spearman rank correlation test was used to correlate the percentages of necrosis from MR evaluation and from pathology. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to determine the performance of subtracted versus nonsubtracted datasets for the diagnosis of complete tumor necrosis. RESULTS: There were 57 HCCs (mean size, 2.4 cm; range, 1.2-4.2 cm) diagnosed at explant and identified on MRI, including 16 completely necrotic HCCs. Subtraction demonstrated better interobserver agreement than nonsubtraction dataset for the diagnosis of tumor necrosis. There was a strong correlation between image subtraction and histopathologic assessment of necrosis (r = 0.80-0.86, depending on the phase, P < 0.0001). Subtraction demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy for the diagnosis of complete tumor necrosis compared with nonsubtracted dataset. CONCLUSION: Image subtraction enables accurate assessment of necrosis of HCC after TACE with the best accuracy observed at the arterial phase."

METHODS: A retrospective review of sonographic findings was conducted on 16 patients with surgically proven ovarian GCTs. Patients' ages ranged from 10 to 64 years (mean, 37.7 years). We evaluated the sizes and morphologic appearances of the ovarian tumors. The blood flow patterns of the tumors were assessed with Doppler sonography (n = 6). Sonographic findings were compared with pathologic findings. RESULTS: The maximal diameters of the masses were 2.0 to 15.4 cm (mean, 8.2 cm). The morphologic appearances of the masses were classified into 3 patterns; solid and cystic (n = 10), solid with a sponge form appearance (n = 4), and entirely solid (n = 2). The measured resistive index and pulsatility index of the solid portions were 0.23 to 0.5 and 0.26 to 0.62, respectively. Pathologic diagnoses of 13 adult ovarian GCTs and 3 juvenile GCTs were obtained. The solid and cystic masses had GCTs with macrofollicular and microfollicular patterns pathologically. The solid masses with a sponge form appearance had prominent hemorrhagic necrosis and diffuse proliferation of granulosa cells with trabecular and microfollicular patterns. The entirely solid masses had diffuse cellular proliferation with a trabecular pattern without cystic changes or hemorrhagic foci. CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic findings of ovarian GCTs included solid and cystic masses, solid masses with a sponge form appearance, and entirely solid masses, and the sonographic findings correlated well with the histopathologic findings."

STUDY DESIGN: Local complexity of solid tissues was measured in images of discrete tissue compartments. Exclusive areas associated with cell nuclei (v-cells) were computed using a watershed transform of the nuclear staining intensity. Mathematical morphology was used to define neighborhood membership, distances and identify complete nested neighborhoods. Neighborhood complexity was estimated as the scaling of the number of neighbors relative to reference v-cells. RESULTS: The methodology applied to hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections from normal, dysplastic and neoplastic oral epithelium revealed that the scaling exponent, over a finite range of neighborhood levels, is nonunique and fractional. While scaling values overlapped across classes, the average was marginally higher in neoplastic than in dysplastic and normal epithelia. The best classificatory power of the exponent was 58% correct classification into 3 diagnostic classes (11 levels) and 83% between dysplastic and neoplastic classes (13 levels). CONCLUSION: V-cell architecture retains features of the original tissue classes and demonstrates an increase in tissue disorder in neoplasia. This methodology seems suitable for extracting information from tissues where identification of cell boundaries (and therefore segmentation into individual cells) is unfeasible."

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) can quantify diffusion parameters and volumetric changes in white matter that can be correlated with neuropsychological performances in longitudinal studies. METHODS: We examined 9 patients with CO intoxication using DTI, VBM and neuropsychologic tests at an average of 3 and 10 months after CO exposure. We used data from 18 age- and sex-matched controls for comparison. RESULTS: We found that cognitive recovery at 10 months after CO intoxication was not significant, although it was after 3 months. The neuropsychologic tests correlated better for the fibre tract of the semicentrum ovale and not the periventricular fibres. Diffusion measures suggest increases in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and axial eigenvalues over time, while increases in radial eigenvalue were evident at 3 months compared with controls. Periventricular white matter atrophy was observed 10 months after CO intoxication. LIMITATIONS: Our study included few cases, and the interpretation of the putative changes on neuroimaging findings cannot be confirmed by histology. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the evolution of white matter injury in CO encephalopathy occurred over time. Cognitive recovery was not evident in the follow-up period because of white matter injuries."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SPIO-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that included FLAIR EPI, T2-weighted TSE, T2*-weighted GRE, and DW EPI sequences was performed using a 3 T system in 54 consecutive patients who underwent surgical exploration with intraoperative ultrasonography. A total of 88 malignant liver tumors were evaluated. Images were reviewed independently by two blinded observers who used a 5-point confidence scale to identify lesions. Results were correlated with results of histopathologic findings and surgical exploration with intraoperative ultrasonography. The accuracy of each MRI sequence was measured with jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. The sensitivity of each observer with each MRI sequence was compared with McNemar's test. RESULTS: Accuracy values were significantly higher with FLAIR EPI sequence (0.93) than with T2*-weighted GRE (0.80) or DW EPI sequences (0.80) (P < 0.05). Sensitivity was significantly higher with the FLAIR EPI sequence than with any of the other sequences. CONCLUSION: SPIO-enhanced FLAIR EPI sequence was more accurate in the diagnosis of malignant liver tumors than T2*-weighted GRE and DW EPI sequences. SPIO-enhanced FLAIR EPI sequence is helpful for the detection of malignant liver tumors."

METHODS: In a comparative case series study, in vivo confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to investigate subbasal nerve fiber bundles in healthy individuals and at various time points after surgery in patients who had undergone LASIK and corneal grafting. Corneal sensation was measured (Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer). RESULTS: In normal corneas investigated, image superimposition revealed the consistent appearance of curved nerve fibers showing a whorl-like pattern with clockwise orientation. Nerve fibers parallel to Bowman's layer originating peripherally traveled radially inwards to a point located at the lower nasal quadrant. This pattern was not seen in any of the patients after LASIK or PK. Regenerated nerve fibers were thinner, more curved, and showed abnormal branching in nearly all patients. Normal corneal neuro-anatomical architecture remained absent even months after total restoration of corneal sensation. After LASIK, normal sensation was regained independently of normal subbasal nerve anatomy. Corneal grafts have shown some recovery of subbasal nerve morphology, at least in the graft periphery, but not complete recovery of function. CONCLUSIONS: It would appear that normal corneal sensation after LASIK or PK does not always depend on normal subbasal nerve anatomy but on the collateral organization of subbasal nerve fibers."

However, recent advances in the field have revealed that mitochondria are also involved in many other cellular activities like lipid modifications, redox balance, calcium balance, and even controlled cell death. These multifunctional organelles are motile and highly dynamic in shapes and forms; the dynamism is brought about by the mitochondria's ability to undergo fission and fusion with each other. Therefore, it is very important to be able to image mitochondrial shape changes to relate to the variety of cellular functions these organelles have to accomplish. The protocols described here will enable researchers to perform steady-state and time-lapse imaging of mitochondria in live cells by using confocal microscopy. High-resolution three-dimensional imaging of mitochondria will not only be helpful in understanding mitochondrial structure in detail but it also could be used to analyze their structural relationships with other organelles in the cell. FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) studies can be performed to understand mitochondrial dynamics or dynamics of any mitochondrial molecule within the organelle. The microirradiation assay can be performed to study functional continuity between mitochondria. A protocol for measuring mitochondrial potential has also been included in this unit. In conclusion, the protocols described here will aid the understanding of mitochondrial structure-function relationship."

This instrument allowed us to investigate the impact of the laser beam aberrations on two-photon autofluorescence imaging of human retinal tissues. We demonstrated that nonlinear microscopy images are improved when laser beam aberrations are minimized by realigning the laser system cavity while wavefront controlling. Nonlinear signals from several human retinal anatomical features have been detected for the first time, without the need of fixation or staining procedures. Beyond the improved image quality, this approach reduces the required excitation power levels, minimizing the side effects of phototoxicity within the imaged sample. In particular, this may be important to study the physiology and function of the healthy and diseased retina."

METHODS: For this investigation we use Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging microcopy to study changes in the structure of the ovarian ECM in human normal and malignant ex vivo biopsies. This method directly visualizes the type I collagen in the ECM and provides quantitative metrics of the fibrillar assembly. To quantify these changes in collagen morphology we utilized an integrated approach combining 3D SHG imaging measurements and bulk optical parameter measurements in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations of the experimental data to extract tissue structural properties. RESULTS: We find the SHG emission attributes (directionality and relative intensity) and bulk optical parameters, both of which are related to the tissue structure, are significantly different in the tumors in a manner that is consistent with the change in collagen assembly. The normal and malignant tissues have highly different collagen fiber assemblies, where collectively, our findings show that the malignant ovaries are characterized by lower cell density, denser collagen, as well as higher regularity at both the fibril and fiber levels. This further suggests that the assembly in cancer may be comprised of newly synthesized collagen as opposed to modification of existing collagen. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the large structural changes in tissue assembly and the SHG sensitivity to these collagen alterations, quantitative discrimination is achieved using small patient data sets. Ultimately these measurements may be developed as intrinsic biomarkers for use in clinical applications."

However, how the force due to fluid shear stress applied to the apical surface of ECs is transmitted to the mechanosensors is poorly understood. In the present paper, we performed an analysis of an intracellular mechanical field by observation of the deformation behaviors of living ECs exposed to shear stress with a novel experimental method. Lateral images of human umbilical vein ECs before and after the onset of flow were obtained by confocal microscopy, and image correlation and finite element analysis were performed for quantitative analyses of subcellular strain due to shear stress. The shear strain of the cells changed from 1.06+/-1.09% (mean+/-SD) to 4.67+/-1.79% as the magnitude of the shear stress increased from 2 to 10 Pa. The nuclei of ECs also exhibited shear deformation, which was similar to that observed in cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclei transmit forces from apical to intracellular components, as well as cytoskeletons. The obtained strain-stress relation resulted in a mean shear modulus of 213 Pa for adherent ECs. These results provide a mechanical perspective on the investigation of flow-sensing mechanisms of ECs."

Lack of contrast among prostatic tissues and high false positive or negative detection rates of prostate lesions have limited the use of current imaging modalities in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. In this study, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is introduced to visualize the anatomical and abnormal structures in freshly excised human prostates. A modified Siemens Antares ultrasound scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc., Malvern, PA) and a Siemens VF10-5 linear array were used to acquire ARFI images. The transducer was attached to a three-dimensional (3-D) translation stage, which was programmed to automate volumetric data acquisition. A depth dependent gain (DDG) method was developed and applied to 3-D ARFI datasets to compensate for the displacement gradients associated with spatially varying radiation force magnitudes as a function of depth. Nine human prostate specimens were collected and imaged immediately after surgical excision. Prostate anatomical structures such as seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, peripheral zone, central zone, transition zone and verumontanum were visualized with high spatial resolution and in good agreement with McNeal's zonal anatomy. The characteristic appearance of prostate pathologies, such as prostate cancerous lesions, benign prostatic hyperplasia, calcified tissues and atrophy were identified in ARFI images based upon correlation with the corresponding histologic slides. This study demonstrates that ARFI imaging can be used to visualize internal structures and detecting suspicious lesions in the prostate and appears promising for image guidance of prostate biopsy."

METHODS: Clinical, sonographic, and histologic data on 56 women (mean age, 47.8 years; range, 27-81 years) with a diagnosis of carcinoma in the uterine cervix were analyzed. Tumor volume and 3D-PDA indexes (vascularization index, flow index, and vascularization flow index) were calculated in all cases. These data were correlated with some tumoral features such as histologic type, histologic grade, lymphovascular space involvement, lymph node metastases, and tumor stage. RESULTS: Intratumoral blood flow was found in all cases. No correlation was found between tumor volume and 3D-PDA indexes with histologic type, lymphovascular space involvement, and lymph node metastases. Moderately and poorly differentiated tumors and advanced-stage tumors had larger volume and 3D-PDA indexes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that tumor vascularization as assessed by 3D-PDA correlates with some tumor features in cervical cancer."

Posterior fossa duras with the superior sagittal sinus, the inferior and superior petrosal sinuses were dissected and taken out from fresh human cadavers by cutting at the superior sagittal sinus, the marginal sinuses and the petrosal sinuses bilaterally. The length of the occipital sinuses was measured using calipers. A 0.5-cm section of the occipital sinus was cut out at its midpoint and prepared for measurements of the perimeter and diameter using a stereology workstation. The sinuses were also examined qualitatively using a surgical microscope. There was no occipital sinus in 6.6% of total 30 cases. Multiple occipital sinuses were seen in 10%. In one specimen, the sinus seemed incomplete, failing to reach the marginal sinuses. Some specimens gave the impression that more than one occipital sinus was present, nevertheless, careful dissection showed connections. The breadth of the sinus steadily narrowed downward in direction of foramen magnum. The inner wall with many fibrous bridges was tight, except the lateral parts that were easily separated into two dural sheets. The length of the sinus varied from 10 to 37 mm. The inner diameter (feret maximum) varied from 0.33 to 7.06 mm at midpoint. The breadth of the multiple sinuses did not exceed the mean of our series except in one case. The occipital sinus, which is generally ellipsoid in shape, functions in the majority of cases as a thin, single midline sinus. It may have less resistant recesses laterally."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients (90 lesions) underwent 3 Tesla (T) breast MRI including a DWI-scan using b-values 0, 150, 499, and 1500 s/mm(2) and histological analysis. Five combinations of b-values were used to calculate the ADC, each with different sensitivities to perfusion and diffusion effects. The median ADC of benign lesions, noninvasive carcinomas and invasive carcinomas and the diagnostic performance of the five methods were compared. RESULTS: Eighty-eight lesions were analyzed (37 benign, 13 noninvasive carcinomas, 38 invasive carcinomas). The median ADC was highest in benign lesions, intermediate in noninvasive carcinomas and lowest in invasive carcinomas for all methods. Calculating the ADC with the lowest 2 b-values yielded the highest ADC for all lesions types; the highest 2 b-values yielded the lowest ADC. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was approximately equal for all methods. CONCLUSION: The ADC of breast lesions varied substantially with the choice of different b-values, indicating that absolute ADC threshold values to differentiate benign and malignant lesions should be interpreted with caution. However, the diagnostic performance of quantitative DWI was not affected by the choice of different b-values."

Wistar and lean ZF and ZDF rats showed no or minimal islet pathology or plasma biochemical alterations at both timepoints. Obese ZFs were euglycaemic at both timepoints and mildly and severely hyperinsulinaemic at 6 and 14 weeks respectively. Islet morphology was normal at 6 weeks but at 14 weeks, islet hyperplasia was present with a minority showing degenerative changes namely, beta-cell vacuolation, vascular congestion and haemorrhage with minimal mononuclear cell and T lymphocytic infiltration. Obese ZDFs were euglycaemic and moderately hyperinsulinaemic at 6 weeks and severely hyperglycaemic with minor hypoinsulinaemia at 14 weeks. Obese ZDFs at 6 weeks showed mainly normal islets with some displaying degeneration (ranging from beta-cell vacuolation alone to the features described above). At 14 weeks, islet degeneration was more severe and widespread: beta-cell death was present in numerous islets at low level. Islet beta-cell numbers were reduced or absent (with associated reduction in insulin immunostaining) within the islets that now consisted predominantly of fibroblasts, collagen and mononuclear cells. Fibroproliferation consisting of smooth muscle actin-alpha-positive tissue was associated with mononuclear cell infiltration. Some fibrous scars were visible indicative of lost islets. Islet degeneration in obese ZF and ZDF rats was not accompanied by a reduction in beta-cell proliferation or in compensatory proliferation of beta-cell neogenic clusters. In the light of recent reports of adaptive and inflammation-mediated degenerative changes in human non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) islets, the hypertrophy/hyperplasia of beta-cells and islet degeneration involving infiltration by monocyte/macrophages in obese ZF and obese ZDF rats respectively offers substantial potential for elucidation of the processes involved."

Here, we study the association between neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors and beta-arrestin2, using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to directly report underlying protein-protein interactions. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Y1 receptors were tagged with a C-terminal fragment, Yc, of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and beta-arrestin2 fused with the complementary N-terminal fragment, Yn. After Y receptor-beta-arrestin association, YFP fragment refolding to regenerate fluorescence (BiFC) was examined by confocal microscopy in transfected HEK293 cells. Y receptor/beta-arrestin2 BiFC responses were also quantified by automated imaging and granularity analysis. KEY RESULTS: NPY stimulation promoted association between Y1-Yc and beta-arrestin2-Yn, and the specific development of BiFC in intracellular compartments, eliminated when using non-interacting receptor and arrestin mutants. Responses developed irreversibly and were slower than for downstream Y1 receptor-YFP internalization, a consequence of delayed maturation and stability of complemented YFP. However, beta-arrestin2 BiFC measurements delivered appropriate ligand pharmacology for both Y1 and Y2 receptors, and demonstrated higher affinity of Y1 compared to Y2 receptors for beta-arrestin2. Receptor mutagenesis combined with beta-arrestin2 BiFC revealed that alternative arrangements of Ser/Thr residues in the Y1 receptor C tail could support beta-arrestin2 association, and that Y2 receptor-beta-arrestin2 interaction was enhanced by the intracellular loop mutation H155P. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The BiFC approach quantifies Y receptor ligand pharmacology focused on the beta-arrestin2 pathway, and provides insight into mechanisms of beta-arrestin2 recruitment by activated and phosphorylated 7TMRs, at the level of protein-protein interaction."

These imaging data sets are readily resectioned digitally in arbitrary planes, suitable for rapid high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) observation. Using these imaging datasets, a web-accessible digital Human Embryo Atlas (http://apps.devbio.pitt.edu/humanatlas/) was created containing serial 2D images of human embryos in three standard histological planes: sagittal, frontal, and transverse. In addition, annotations and 3D reconstructions were generated for visualizing different anatomical structures. Overall, this Human Embryo Atlas is a unique resource that provides morphologic data of human developmental anatomy that can accelerate basic research investigations into developmental mechanisms that underlie human congenital anomalies."

Other prognostic features, however, which are not yet used in daily practice, might add important information and thus improve prognosis, treatment, and survival. Therefore a search for new markers is desirable. Previous studies have demonstrated that fractal characteristics of nuclear chromatin are of prognostic importance in neoplasias. We have therefore investigated whether the fractal dimension of nuclear chromatin measured in routine histological preparations of malignant melanomas could be a prognostic factor for survival. METHODS: We examined 71 primary superficial spreading cutaneous melanoma specimens (thickness > or = 1 mm) from patients with a minimum follow up of 5 years. Nuclear area, form factor and fractal dimension of chromatin texture were obtained from digitalized images of hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue micro array sections. Clark's level, tumor thickness and mitotic rate were also determined. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 104 months. Tumor thickness, Clark's level, mitotic rate, nuclear area and fractal dimension were significant risk factors in univariate Cox regressions. In the multivariate Cox regression, stratified for the presence or absence of metastases at diagnosis, only the Clark level and fractal dimension of the nuclear chromatin were included as independent prognostic factors in the final regression model. CONCLUSION: In general, a more aggressive behaviour is usually found in genetically unstable neoplasias with a higher number of genetic or epigenetic changes, which on the other hand, provoke a more complex chromatin rearrangement. The increased nuclear fractal dimension found in the more aggressive melanomas is the mathematical equivalent of a higher complexity of the chromatin architecture. So, there is strong evidence that the fractal dimension of the nuclear chromatin texture is a new and promising variable in prognostic models of malignant melanomas."

Thus, the discovery and conservation of archaeological bone materials is of great importance to get access to this information. However, archaeological materials are altered by different postmortem processes and it appears necessary to estimate if the archaeological information is still reliable or if it has been modified during burial. As archaeological bone materials present a high structural hierarchy at the micro- and nanoscale, changes induced by diagenetic phenomena have to be observed at these scales. One method for revealing post mortem changes of the bone structure and composition at the microscale is synchrotron radiation micro-FTIR imaging (SR micro-FTIR). Thus, thin sections of about 5,000-year-old archaeological bones have been analysed in transmission mode at the IRIS beamline (BESSY II, HZB Berlin) to determine markers of the state of bone preservation at the microscale. The archaeological bone material comes from station 19 of the Neolithic site of the Chalain Lake. By using SR micro-FTIR it was possible to image characteristic bone structures, e.g. osteons (the constitutive histological unit of cortical bone), using the absorption band ratios corresponding to different chemical bone constituents (collagen content and quality, phosphate crystallinity, carbonate content). These data allow us to precisely evaluate the state of preservation of a 5,000-year-old bone at the histological level."

Excision-based histology provides a limited two-dimensional presentation of tissue morphology at the cost of halting disease progression at a single time point and sacrifice of the animal. We investigate the use of noninvasive reflectance mode confocal scanning laser microscopy (rCSLM) as an alternative tool to biopsy in documenting epidermal hyperplasia in murine models exposed to the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). An automated technique utilizing average axial rCSLM reflectance profiles is used to extract epidermal thickness values from rCSLM data cubes. In comparisons to epidermal thicknesses determined from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections, we find no significant correlation to rCSLM-derived thickness values. This results from method-specific artifacts: physical alterations of tissue during H&E preparation in standard histology and specimen-induced abberations in rCSLM imaging. Despite their disagreement, both histology and rCSLM methods reliably measure statistically significant thickness changes in response to TPA exposure. Our results demonstrate that in vivo rCSLM imaging provides epithelial biologists an accurate noninvasive means to monitor cutaneous pathogenesis."

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the functional and morphological features of colorectal cancer to identify the neoplastic patterns that affect patient survival. METHODS: Forty-five patients with colorectal cancer were followed for a minimum of 3 years. Blood levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were measured by chemiluminescence and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue expression followed by computer-assisted image processing. Tumors were assigned to three morphofunctional classes. The morphofunctional classification was based on combination between histological differentiation and cell polarization. The functional characterization was based on the CEA cell polarization. The tissue polarization of CEA was classified in well-polarized, moderately polarized or nonpolarized cells. Morphofunctional staging was defined by the association between morphofunctional class (polarization and histological differentiation) and TNM by score given to each one classification. RESULTS: There was an association between increased CEA tissue expression and loss of histological differentiation (P = 0.01) or loss of polarization capacity (P = 0.03). There was a progressive increase in tissue CEA quantities in accordance with the proposed morphofunctional grading system. Plasma levels of CEA were increased in advanced tumor stages. Blood levels of CEA were increased in advanced morphofunctional stages (P = 0.001). There was a relationship between survival outcome and morphofunctional staging (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Morphofunctional staging is a valuable prognostic factor for colorectal cancer and it correlates with plasma CEA levels."

RESULTS: Among 375 removed ovaries, 141 cancers (83 adenocarcinomas, 24 borderline, 16 cases of carcinomatosis, nine of metastases and nine others) and 234 non-cancerous ovaries (107 normal, 127 benign tumours) were histologically diagnosed. The new computer-aided technology correctly identified 138/141 malignant lesions and 206/234 non-malignant tissues (98% sensitivity, 88% specificity). There were no false-negative results among the 47 FIGO stage I/II ovarian lesions. Standard TVS and CA125 had sensitivities/specificities of 94%/66% and 89%/75%, respectively. Combining standard TVS and the new technology in parallel significantly improved TVS specificity from 66% to 92% (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Computer-aided quantification of backscattered ultrasound is a highly sensitive for the diagnosis of malignant ovarian masses."

Epub 2010 Apr 29.,Monaco JP,Med Image Anal,2010,2010/05/25,PMC2916937,NIHMS207594,10.1016/j.media.2010.04.007,"In this paper we present a high-throughput system for detecting regions of carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) in HSs from radical prostatectomies (RPs) using probabilistic pairwise Markov models (PPMMs), a novel type of Markov random field (MRF). At diagnostic resolution a digitized HS can contain 80Kx70K pixels - far too many for current automated Gleason grading algorithms to process. However, grading can be separated into two distinct steps: (1) detecting cancerous regions and (2) then grading these regions. The detection step does not require diagnostic resolution and can be performed much more quickly. Thus, we introduce a CaP detection system capable of analyzing an entire digitized whole-mount HS (2x1.75cm(2)) in under three minutes (on a desktop computer) while achieving a CaP detection sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.90, respectively. We obtain this high-throughput by tailoring the system to analyze the HSs at low resolution (8microm per pixel). This motivates the following algorithm: (Step 1) glands are segmented, (Step 2) the segmented glands are classified as malignant or benign, and (Step 3) the malignant glands are consolidated into continuous regions. The classification of individual glands leverages two features: gland size and the tendency for proximate glands to share the same class. The latter feature describes a spatial dependency which we model using a Markov prior. Typically, Markov priors are expressed as the product of potential functions. Unfortunately, potential functions are mathematical abstractions, and constructing priors through their selection becomes an ad hoc procedure, resulting in simplistic models such as the Potts. Addressing this problem, we introduce PPMMs which formulate priors in terms of probability density functions, allowing the creation of more sophisticated models. To demonstrate the efficacy of our CaP detection system and assess the advantages of using a PPMM prior instead of the Potts, we alternately incorporate both priors into our algorithm and rigorously evaluate system performance, extracting statistics from over 6000 simulations run across 40 RP specimens. Perhaps the most indicative result is as follows: at a CaP sensitivity of 0.87 the accompanying false positive rates of the system when alternately employing the PPMM and Potts priors are 0.10 and 0.20, respectively."

Although spectrally encoded confocal microscopy has better transverse resolution than optical frequency domain imaging, optical frequency domain imaging can penetrate deeper into tissues, which potentially enables the visualization of different morphologic features. We have developed a co-registered spectrally encoded confocal microscopy and optical frequency domain imaging system and have obtained preliminary images from human oesophageal biopsy samples to compare the capabilities of these imaging techniques for diagnosing oesophageal pathology."

STUDY DESIGN: Computer-generated three-dimensional reconstruction of the cochlear apex and tabulation of the number of cases with arched Reissner's membranes (pseudohydrops) versus flat membranes. SETTING: Temporal bone laboratory consisting of 809 documented pairs of temporal bones. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Archival temporal bone sections from 107 bones (65 patients) were used to determine the percentage of arched (pseudohydrops) versus flat Reissner's membranes. Two bones, one of each membrane shape, were randomly selected for computer-generated three-dimensional reconstructions showing the cochlear apical anatomy. RESULTS: An arched Reissner's membrane was found in 48.6 percent of bones. In the cochlear apex, Reissner's membrane appears to be distended, simulating hydrops, due to its transition from a conical structure to a triangle bounded by the basilar membrane with the organ of Corti, the stria vascularis, and Reissner's membrane. Membrane findings were similar in both ears in 73.8 percent of the bilateral cases studied. There were no significant relationships between membrane type and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: What appears to be endolymphatic hydrops of the cochlear apex is the transition area of the cochlear duct from a conical shape at the extreme apex to the triangular shape found in the rest of the cochlea. The appearance of distension is dependent upon the cochlear length and the level of the microscopic section."

Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to identify differences in single-cell Raman spectra. These spectral differences correlate with (1) cell cycle progression and (2) changing confluency of a cell culture during the first 3 to 4 days after sub-culturing. Cell cycle regulatory drugs are used to synchronize the cell cycle progression of cell cultures, and flow cytometry is used to determine the cell cycle distribution of cell cultures at the time of Raman analysis. Spectral variability arising from cell cycle progression is (1) expressed as varying intensities of protein and nucleic acid features relative to lipid features, (2) well correlated with known biochemical changes in cells as they progress through the cell cycle, and (3) shown to be the most significant source of inherent spectral variability between cells. Furthermore, the specific biomolecules responsible for the observed spectral variability due to both cell cycle progression and changes in cell culture confluency can be identified in the first and second components of principal component analysis (PCA). Our characterization of the inherent sources of variability in Raman spectra of single human cells will be useful for understanding subtle spectral differences in RM studies of single cells."

Even so, genetic and environmental factors that influence brain asymmetry are largely unknown. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) now allows asymmetry to be studied at a microscopic scale by examining differences in fiber characteristics across hemispheres rather than differences in structure shapes and volumes. Here we analyzed 4Tesla DTI scans from 374 healthy adults, including 60 monozygotic twin pairs, 45 same-sex dizygotic pairs, and 164 mixed-sex DZ twins and their siblings; mean age: 24.4years+/-1.9 SD). All DTI scans were nonlinearly aligned to a geometrically-symmetric, population-based image template. We computed voxel-wise maps of significant asymmetries (left/right differences) for common diffusion measures that reflect fiber integrity (fractional and geodesic anisotropy; FA, GA and mean diffusivity, MD). In quantitative genetic models computed from all same-sex twin pairs (N=210 subjects), genetic factors accounted for 33% of the variance in asymmetry for the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, 37% for the anterior thalamic radiation, and 20% for the forceps major and uncinate fasciculus (all L>R). Shared environmental factors accounted for around 15% of the variance in asymmetry for the cortico-spinal tract (R>L) and about 10% for the forceps minor (L>R). Sex differences in asymmetry (men>women) were significant, and were greatest in regions with prominent FA asymmetries. These maps identify heritable DTI-derived features, and may empower genome-wide searches for genetic polymorphisms that influence brain asymmetry."

In the proposed approach, scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) points around live cells in the microscopic image are detected, and a structure locality preservation (SLP) scheme using Laplacian Eigenmap is proposed to track the SIFT feature points along successive frames of low-contrast DIC videos. Experiments on low-contrast DIC microscopic videos of various live-cell lines shows that in comparison with principal component analysis (PCA) based SIFT tracking, the proposed Laplacian-SIFT can significantly reduce the error rate of SIFT feature tracking. With this enhancement, further experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is a robust and accurate approach to tackling the challenge of live-cell tracking in DIC microscopy."

OBJECT: To assess our clinical experiences using a novel approach, stereoscopic virtual reality environment, to help neurosurgeons with both surgical training and surgical strategic planning purposes. METHODS: Patient-specific digital imaging data obtained from a variety of different diagnostic sources (computed tomography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance, functional magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance-diffusion tensor imaging) were collected and then transferred to a workstation setting. These clinical data were obtained from 100 patients who were suffering from either brain vascular malformations or tumors that were located in difficult brain sites. A 3-dimensional volume rendering was produced for each of the 100 clinical cases, which were then subjected to data coregistration and fusion. RESULTS: By using different head positioning systems and craniotomy options, we simulated microscopic visualizations of the lesion through numerous surgical approaches and from various angles of view. This simulation strategy enabled us to carry out an approach selection and eventually to identify the optimum angle of lesion visualization. CONCLUSION: These virtual craniotomies successfully simulated a sampling of different operative environments that have the potential to play a significant role in neurosurgical training and operative planning worthy of further exploration and development."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 70 complex cystic renal masses in 59 patients (45 men, 14 women; mean age, 68 +/- 13 years) who underwent 64-MDCT at two medical centers were studied. Twenty-three of the masses were confirmed on the basis of the histologic findings and 47 in 2-4 years of follow-up. Images were reviewed in two sessions by two radiologists with 12 and 2 years of experience. In the first session, 5-mm axial images were analyzed, and in the second, thin axial images and multiplanar reconstructions. To assess intraobserver variability, analysis was repeated after 1 month. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon's signed rank test, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and weighted kappa statistics. RESULTS: Radiologists 1 and 2 detected thicker cystic walls (p < 0.001, p < 0.005) and septa (p < 0.03, p < 0.05) and fewer septa (p < 0.005, p < 0.002) on 5-mm axial images and assigned significantly different Bosniak categories than they did in analysis of the volume data (p < 0.04, p < 0.05). Variability was reduced in thin axial and multiplanar views. No significant differences were found in characterization of lesions as benign or malignant in review of 5-mm axial images and volume data sets. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.89 for 5-mm images and 0.96 for volume data sets for radiologist 1 and 0.87 and 0.90 for radiologist 2. CONCLUSION: Analysis of volume data sets is associated with less intraobserver and interobserver variability than review of 5-mm axial images. Wall thickness and the number and thickness of septa may differ, resulting in assignment of different Bosniak categories. Diagnostic performance in characterizing lesions as benign or malignant, however, is not statistically different for the thick and thin images."

Peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating condition that arises from many common health problems, and its presence is often confirmed with an invasive clinical test called intramuscular electromyography (EMG). In this study, the possibility of developing an alternative or adjunct test to EMG based on the appearance of nerve fibers in corneal micrographs was explored. Since corneal imaging is virtually noninvasive compared with EMG, such a test may be administered more liberally and frequently, before neuropathy symptoms occur. METHODS: A software program that automatically traces nerve fibers in corneal micrographs and generates measures based on these traces was implemented. This software was applied to a database of images collected by confocal laser scanning corneal microscopy from diabetic subjects whose levels of neuropathy were measured with EMG and from healthy subjects. RESULTS: Trends in the nerve fiber density and various measures of shape were calculated and observed, to explore the possibility of using these measures as a clinical tool for corroborating symptoms, confirming an evaluation, or evaluating risk factors for developing neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary statistical trends show a potential for measuring and observing neuropathy severity or for providing an objective risk measure for a patient's ensuing condition. More work is needed in the development of the measures and in their testing to prove that the measures can be made repeatable in a clinical environment."

Hallmarks of nuclear nanostructure are found on the scale below 100 nm for both human fibroblast and HeLa cells. Mechanical measures were extracted as a quantitative tool from the histone density fluctuations inside the cell to obtain structural fluctuations on the scale of several micrometers. Results show that different mechanisms of expression of the same nuclear protein type lead to significantly different patterns on the nanoscale and to pronounced differences in the detected compressibility of chromatin. The observed fluctuations, including the experimental evidence for dynamic looping, are consistent with a recently proposed chromatin model."

However, most investigations on cell morphology dynamics are time and resource consuming, of rather descriptive character and lack procedures for appropriate quantification. The aim of the study was to develop a software programme which allows automated cell segmentation and identification as well as calculation and further processing of cell size in low-contrast images. The software utilises modified edge detection and morphologic operations for automatic cell analysis in light microscopy images. In an application study, osteogenic cell-adhesion dynamics were quantified for the ECM proteins collagen type I (COL) and fibronectin (FIB) over a period of 12 hrs. Untreated tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) served as control. The software programme proofed full function in automatic cell tracking and quantification of cell size. After 11 h, cell sizes were highest for COL (6391 +/- 1167 microm(2)) and FIB (6036 +/- 411 microm(2)) compared with TCPS (3261 +/- 693 microm(2)). The developed software allows quantification of initial cell size changes on translucent surface modifications and is suitable as a reliable tool for fast biocompatibility screening. Osteogenic cell adhesion was significantly promoted by COL and FIB indicating the potential of respective functionalized biomaterial surfaces."

The literature shows few studies on its physiopathogeny. However, changes in alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) secretion and melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) expression may play a role to trigger this condition. Biopsies were taken from both melasma skin and adjacent perilesional normal skin of 44 patients. The biopsies were submitted for hematoxylin and eosin and Fontana-Masson staining and immunohistochemistry with Melan-A, alpha-MSH, and MC1-R, and processed for transmission electron microscopy. In some cases, they were submitted to MC1-R gene expression analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Increased lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and solar elastosis, higher epidermal melanin were observed in melasma skin. Electron microscopy revealed a greater number of mature melanosomes in keratinocytes and melanocytes, and more prominent cytoplasmic organelles in melasma skin. There was no difference in melanocyte number between areas. However, melanocytes were larger and more dendritic in melasma skin. Immunohistochemistry with alpha-MSH and MC1-R showed significant labeling in melasmic epidermis but MC1-R messenger ribonucleic acid (RNAm) did not show significant quantitative difference between melasma and normal skin."

Existing techniques focus primarily on using diffusivity-based quantities derived from diffusion tensor as surrogate measures of microstructural tissue properties of white matter. In this paper, we describe a novel tract-specific framework that enables the examination of white matter morphometry at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales. The framework leverages the skeleton-based modeling of sheet-like white matter fasciculi using the continuous medial representation, which gives a natural definition of thickness and supports its comparison across subjects. The thickness measure provides a macroscopic characterization of white matter fasciculi that complements existing analysis of microstructural features. The utility of the framework is demonstrated in quantifying white matter atrophy in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a severe neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons. We show that, compared to using microscopic features alone, combining the macroscopic and microscopic features gives a more complete characterization of the disease."

Similarly, the relationship of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion to Gleason score and morphology remains uncertain. We assigned Gleason scores and recorded morphological features for 521 clinically localized prostate cancers sampled in triplicate and arrayed in eight tissue microarray blocks. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to delineate TMPRSS2-ERG aberrations. Using maximum Gleason score, based on three core evaluation, and overall Gleason score, based on prostatectomy sections, Fisher's exact test was performed for tumors with TMPRSS2-ERG translocation/deletion, copy number increase (>/= 3) of the TMPRSS2-ERG region without translocation/deletion, and copy number increase and concomitant translocation/deletion. In all, 217 (42%) translocation/deletion and 30 (5.9%) copy number increase-alone cases were detected. Among 217 translocation/deletion cases, 32 had translocation/deletion with copy number increase. In all, 237, 200, and 75 cancers had maximum core-specific Gleason score of 6, 7, and 8-10, respectively. Tumors with translocation/deletion tended toward lower Gleason scores than those without (P=0.002) with similar results for overall Gleason score (P=0.02); copy number increase cases tended toward higher Gleason scores than those without (P<0.001). Gleason score of 8-10 tumors demonstrated lower odds of translocation/deletion (odds ratio (OR) 0.38; 95% CI 0.21-0.68) and higher odds of copy number increase alone (OR 7.33; 95% CI 2.65-20.31) or copy number increase+translocation/deletion (OR 3.03; 95% CI 1.12-8.15) relative to Gleason score of <7 tumors. No significant difference in TMPRSS2-ERG incidence was observed between patients with and without cribriform glands, glomerulations, signet-ring cells, or intraductal cancer (P=0.821, 0.095, 0.132, 0.375). TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is associated with lower core-specific and overall Gleason scores and not with high-grade morphologies. Conversely, TMPRSS2-ERG copy number increase, with or without rearrangement, is associated with higher Gleason score. These findings indicate that translocation/deletion of TMPRSS2-ERG is not associated with histological features of aggressive prostate cancer."

This study aimed to determine whether whole-tumor histogram analysis of the normalized CBV for contrast-enhancing lesions and perienhancing lesions can differentiate among GBMs, SMTs, and lymphomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with histopathologically confirmed GBMs (n = 28), SMTs (n = 22), or lymphomas (n = 12) underwent conventional MR imaging and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced imaging before surgery. Histogram distribution of the normalized CBV was obtained from whole-tumor voxels in contrast-enhancing lesions and perienhancing lesions. The HW, PHP, and MV were determined from histograms. One-way ANOVA was used initially to test the overall equality of mean values for each type of tumor. Subsequently, posttest multiple comparisons were performed. RESULTS: For whole-tumor histogram analyses for contrast-enhancing lesions, only PHP could differentiate among GBMs (4.79 +/- 1.31), SMTs (3.32 +/- 1.10), and lymphomas (2.08 +/- 0.54). The parameters HW and MV were not significantly different between GBMs and SMTs, whereas the 2 histogram parameters were significantly higher in GBMs and SMTs compared with lymphomas. For the analyses of perienhancing lesions, only MV could differentiate among GBMs (1.90 +/- 0.26), SMTs (0.80 +/- 0.21), and lymphomas (1.27 +/- 0.34). HW and PHP were not significantly different between SMTs and lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: Using a whole-tumor histogram analysis of normalized CBV for contrast-enhancing lesions and perienhancing lesions facilitates differentiation of GBMs, SMTs and lymphomas."

Epub 2010 Jun 28.,Sertel O,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,2010,2010/07/03,PMC3095036,NIHMS292379,10.1109/TBME.2010.2055058,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common lymphoid malignancies in the western world. FL has a variable clinical course, and important clinical treatment decisions for FL patients are based on histological grading, which is done by manually counting the large malignant cells called centroblasts (CB) in ten standard microscopic high-power fields from H&E-stained tissue sections. This method is tedious and subjective; as a result, suffers from considerable inter and intrareader variability even when used by expert pathologists. In this paper, we present a computer-aided detection system for automated identification of CB cells from H&E-stained FL tissue samples. The proposed system uses a unitone conversion to obtain a single-channel image that has the highest contrast. From the resulting image, which has a bimodal distribution due to the H&E stain, a cell-likelihood image is generated. Finally, a two-step CB detection procedure is applied. In the first step, we identify evident nonCB cells based on size and shape. In the second step, the CB detection is further refined by learning and utilizing the texture distribution of nonCB cells. We evaluated the proposed approach on 100 region-of-interest images extracted from ten distinct tissue samples and obtained a promising 80.7% detection accuracy."
20881162,Magnetization transfer ratio may be a surrogate of spongiform change in human prion diseases,"Siddique D, Hyare H, Wroe S, Webb T, Macfarlane R, Rudge P, Collinge J, Powell C, Brandner S, So PW, Walker S, Mead S, Yousry T, Thornton JS.",Brain. 2010 Oct;133(10):3058-68. doi: 10.1093/brain/awq243.,Siddique D,Brain,2010,2010/10/01,,,10.1093/brain/awq243,"Human prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by misfolding of the prion protein. There are no useful biomarkers of disease progression. Cerebral cortex spongiform change, one of the classical pathological features of prion disease, resolves in prion-infected transgenic mice following prion protein gene knockout. We investigated the cross-sectional, longitudinal and post-mortem cerebral magnetization transfer ratios as a surrogate for prion disease pathology. Twenty-three prion disease patients with various prion protein gene mutations and 16 controls underwent magnetization transfer ratio and conventional magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T. For each subject, whole-brain, white and grey matter magnetization transfer ratio histogram mean, peak height, peak location, and magnetization transfer ratio at 25th, 50th and 75th percentile were computed and correlated with several cognitive, functional and neuropsychological scales. Highly significant associations were found between whole brain magnetization transfer ratio and prion disease (P < 0.01). Additionally, highly significant correlations were found between magnetization transfer ratio histogram parameters and clinical, functional and neuropsychological scores (P < 0.01). Longitudinally, decline in the Clinician's Dementia Rating scale was correlated with decline in magnetization transfer ratio. To investigate the histological correlates of magnetization transfer ratio, formalin-fixed cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres from 19 patients and six controls underwent magnetization transfer ratio imaging at 1.5 T, with mean magnetization transfer ratio calculated from six regions of interest, and findings were followed-up in six variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases with 9.4 T high-resolution magnetization transfer imaging on frontal cortex blocks, with semi-quantitative histopathological scoring of spongiosis, astrocytosis and prion protein deposition. Post-mortem magnetization transfer ratios was significantly lower in patients than controls in multiple cortical and subcortical regions, but not frontal white matter. Measurements (9.4 T) revealed a significant and specific negative correlation between cortical magnetization transfer ratios and spongiosis (P = 0.02), but not prion protein deposition or gliosis. The magnetic resonance imaging measurement of magnetization transfer ratios may be an in vivo surrogate for spongiform change and has potential utility as a therapeutic biomarker in human prion disease."

The present study investigates their radiologic and histological features to elucidate diagnostic clues. Six cases were included in the study, one man and five women, ranging in age from 44 to 87 years (mean age, 61 years). Histologically, three cases had demyelination, and one case each had abscess, angiitis, and non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. All cases were evaluated radiologically on MRI, most of them by thallim-201 single photon emission tomography ((201)Tl-SPECT). These cases were examined using H&E, special stains, and immunohistochemical studies with a variety of antibodies. MRI demonstrated perifocal edema and ring-like or solid enhancement, mimicking the malignant tumors. Diffusion-weighted MRI showed a hypo-iso-intensity with a hyperintensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient. A (201)Tl-SPECT study revealed no uptake. Although there were various kinds of pathology, inflammatory cells were observed, associated with vascular proliferation and reactive astrocytosis. In addition, some cases showed demyelinating or destructive changes. These results suggested that intra-axial pseudotumors in the central nervous system contain various kinds of pathology, and detailed clinicopathological analysis is important from the point of view of differential diagnosis."

STUDY DESIGN: Mathematically derived test images of known fractal dimension mimicking the complexity of epithelial morphology were created. The box-counting method was used to compute fractal dimension. To study the effects of resolution on fractal dimension, the test images were convolved with Gaussian point spread functions (PSF), and effects of noise were studied by adding Poisson and Gaussian noise. Application of these findings was illustrated by measuring the resolution and noise for a typical optical microscope and digital camera (OMDC) system. RESULTS: Poor spatial resolution reduces the fractal dimension and has an increased adverse effect on higher dimensions. Fractal dimension can be estimated within 7% of the true dimension, and relative differences of 0.1 between dimensions are distinguishable provided the PSF of an imaging system has a full-width-at-half-maximum < or = 4 pixels and the contrast-to-noise ratio > 15. These conditions were satisfied by our OMDC. CONCLUSION: Effects of noise and resolution from a typical OMDC system do not significantly inhibit the ability to estimate and distinguish relative differences in the fractal dimension of tissue specimens."

Hematopoiesis is complex, requiring self-renewing and pluripotent stem cells, differentiated progenitor and precursor cells, and supportive stroma, adipose tissue, vascular structures, and extracellular matrix. Although imaging is a vital tool in hematology research, the 3-dimensional architecture of the bone marrow tissue in situ remains largely uncharacterized. The major hindrance to imaging the intact marrow is the surrounding bone structures are almost impossible to cut/image through. We have overcome these obstacles and describe a method whereby whole-mounts of bone marrow tissue were immunostained and imaged in 3 dimensions by confocal fluorescence and reflection microscopy. We have successfully mapped by multicolor immunofluorescence the localization pattern of as many as 4 cell features simultaneously over large tiled views and to depths of approximately 150 mum. Three-dimensional images can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively to appreciate the distribution of cell types and their interrelationships, with minimal perturbations of the tissue. We demonstrate its application to normal mouse and human marrow, to murine models of marrow failure, and to patients with aplastic anemia, myeloid, and lymphoid cell malignancies. The technique should be generally adaptable for basic laboratory investigation and for clinical diagnosis of hematologic diseases."

We measure the average placental shape in a birth cohort and the effect deviations from the average have on placental functional efficiency. We test whether altered placental shape improves the specificity of histopathology diagnoses of maternal uteroplacental and fetoplacental vascular pathology for clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1225 Placentas from a prospective cohort had chorionic plate digital photographs with perimeters marked at 1-2 cm intervals. After exclusions of pre-term (n = 202) and velamentous cord insertion (n = 44), 979 (95.7%) placentas were analyzed. Median shape and mean perimeter were estimated. The relationship of fetal and placental weight was used as an index of placental efficiency termed ""beta"". The principal placental histopathology diagnoses of maternal uteroplacental and fetoplacental vascular pathologies were coded by review of individual lesion scores. Acute fetal inflammation was scored as a ""negative control"" pathology not expected to affect shape. ANOVA with Bonferroni tests for subgroup comparisons were used. RESULTS: The mean placental chorionic shape at term was round with a radius estimated at 9.1 cm. Increased variability of the placental shape was associated with lower placental functional efficiency. After stratifying on placental shape, the presence of either maternal uteroplacental or fetoplacental vascular pathology was significantly associated with lower placental efficiency only when shape was abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying abnormality of placental shape is a meaningful clinical tool. Abnormal shapes are associated with reduced placental efficiency. We hypothesize that such shapes reflect deformations of placental vascular architecture, and that an abnormal placental shape serves as a marker of maternal uteroplacental and/or fetoplacental vascular pathology of sufficiently long standing to impact placental (and by extension, potentially fetal) development."

METHODS: Fifty-four recently extracted vital lower incisors were instrumented with either a full range of ProTaper Universal instruments in rotary motion (group 1) or with the single-file F2 ProTaper technique in reciprocating motion (group 2). Teeth were previously classified as round or oval-shaped by means of bidirectional radiographs, resulting in 24 round canals, 24 oval canals, and 12 controls. After instrumentation, the roots were demineralized, and the apical 3 mm was multi-sliced and processed for histologic examination. The percentage of residual pulp tissue (PRPT) was calculated with the aid of image analysis software. Univariate analysis of variance was used to verify the variables influencing PRPT. RESULTS: Both canal shape and technique significantly influenced PRPT (P < .05). Oval-shaped canals displayed much more PRPT than round canals in both techniques (P < .05). The difference in PRPT between the techniques depended on the root canal shape, since a significant interaction between canal shape and technique was observed (P < .05). Group 1 displayed considerably less PRPT in oval canals than group 2 (P < .05), whereas in round canals no significant difference was found between the 2 techniques (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The single-file F2 ProTaper technique displayed similar PRPT to the full range of ProTaper instruments in round canals. However, the debridement quality of the single-file F2 ProTaper technique was suboptimal in oval canals."

As digital imaging technology advances, high resolution microscopy of large tissue volumes is becoming feasible; however, new interactive tools are needed to explore and analyze the enormous datasets. In this paper we present a visualization framework that specifically targets interactive examination of arbitrarily large image stacks. Our framework is built upon two core techniques: display-aware processing and GPU-accelerated texture compression. With display-aware processing, only the currently visible image tiles are fetched and aligned on-the-fly, reducing memory bandwidth and minimizing the need for time-consuming global pre-processing. Our novel texture compression scheme for GPUs is tailored for quick browsing of image stacks. We evaluate the usability of our viewer for two histology applications: digital pathology and visualization of neural structure at nanoscale-resolution in serial electron micrographs."

RCM of SSM shows pagetoid melanocytes (PMs) in the epidermis and disarray at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), which are automatically quantified with a computer algorithm that locates depth of the most superficial pigmented surface [D(SPS)(x,y)] containing PMs in the epidermis and pigmented basal cells near the DEJ. The algorithm uses 200 noninvasive confocal optical sections that image the superficial 200 mum of ten skin sites: five unequivocal SSMs and five nevi. The pattern recognition algorithm automatically identifies PMs in all five SSMs and finds none in the nevi. A large mean gradient psi (roughness) between laterally adjacent points on D(SPS)(x,y) identifies DEJ disruption in SSM psi = 11.7 +/- 3.7 [-] for n = 5 SSMs versus a small psi = 5.5 +/- 1.0 [-] for n = 5 nevi (significance, p = 0.0035). Quantitative endpoint metrics for malignant characteristics make digital RCM data an attractive diagnostic asset for pathologists, augmenting studies thus far, which have relied largely on visual assessment."

The appropriate selection of illumination and collection conditions is required to maximize diagnostic ability. The goals of this study were to (i) evaluate image contrast between oral cancer∕precancer and non-neoplastic mucosa for a variety of imaging modalities and illumination∕collection conditions, and (ii) use classification algorithms to evaluate and compare the diagnostic utility of these modalities to discriminate cancers and precancers from normal tissue. Narrowband reflectance, autofluorescence, and polarized reflectance images were obtained from 61 patients and 11 normal volunteers. Image contrast was compared to identify modalities and conditions yielding greatest contrast. Image features were extracted and used to train and evaluate classification algorithms to discriminate tissue as non-neoplastic, dysplastic, or cancer; results were compared to histologic diagnosis. Autofluorescence imaging at 405-nm excitation provided the greatest image contrast, and the ratio of red-to-green fluorescence intensity computed from these images provided the best classification of dysplasia∕cancer versus non-neoplastic tissue. A sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 85% were achieved in the validation set. Multispectral widefield images can accurately distinguish neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissue; however, the ability to separate precancerous lesions from cancers with this technique was limited."

OBJECTIVE: This study hypothesizes that harmonics optical microscopy can illuminate the spatial mal-alignment of collagen fibers in AF via a layer-by-layer approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Atrial tissues taken from patients who underwent open-heart surgery were examined by harmonics optical microscopy. Using the two-dimensional Fourier transformation method, a spectral-energy description of image texture was constituted and its entropy was used to quantify the mal-alignment of collagen fibers. The amount of collagen fiber was derived from its area ratio to total atrial tissue in each image. Serum C-terminal pro-collagen pro-peptide (CICP), pro-matrix metalloproteinase-1 (pro-MMP-1), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were also evaluated. RESULTS: 46 patients were evaluated, including 20 with normal sinus rhythm and 26 with AF. The entropy of spectral-energy distribution of collagen alignment was significantly higher in AF than that in sinus rhythm (3.97 +/- 0.33 vs. 2.80 +/- 0.18, p<0.005). This difference was more significant in the permanent AF group. The amount of collagen was also significantly higher in AF patients (0.39 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.18 +/- 0.06, p<0.005) but serum markers of cardiac fibrosis were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Harmonics optical microscopy can quantify the spatial mal-alignment of collagen fibers in AF. The entropy of spectral-energy distribution of collagen alignment is a potential tool for research in atrial remodeling."

When combined with advanced data analysis routines, tissues can be analyzed and classified based solely on their molecular content. Such molecular histology techniques have been used to distinguish regions with differential molecular signatures that could not be distinguished using established histologic tools. However, its potential to provide an independent, complementary analysis of clinical tissues has been limited by the very large file sizes and large number of discrete variables associated with imaging MS experiments. Here we demonstrate data reduction tools, based on automated feature identification and extraction, for peptide, protein, and lipid imaging MS, using multiple imaging MS technologies, that reduce data loads and the number of variables by >100x, and that highlight highly-localized features that can be missed using standard data analysis strategies. It is then demonstrated how these capabilities enable multivariate analysis on large imaging MS datasets spanning multiple tissues."

Visual inspection and evaluation of all intraoral digital and conventional radiographs and cone beam CT images were performed twice by three oral radiologists. Weighted kappa coefficients were calculated to assess intra- and interobserver agreement for each image set, and scores were compared with the histological gold standard using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate diagnostic ability. RESULTS: Intraobserver kappa coefficients calculated for each observer for each method of detecting caries ranged from 0.739 to 0.928. Strong interobserver agreement ranging from 0.631 to 0.811 was found for all detection methods. The highest Az values for all three observers were obtained with the cone beam CT images; however, differences between detection methods were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Visual inspection, film, CCD, PSP plates and cone beam CT performed similarly in the detection of proximal caries."

He also showed some cracking spaces close to lymphoid follicles resembling vessels. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible lymphatic nature of these spaces and their prevalence in non-neoplastic thyroid tissue. Ten cases of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), 5 of Basedow-Graves disease (BG), and 5 of normal thyroid tissue (NT) were selected. Tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, CD31 (Dako), and D2-40 (Dako) stains. Cracking spaces staining positive for CD31 and D2-40 stains were considered as lymphatic vessels. Site, distribution, intravascular valves and lymphocytes, perivascular lymphoid aggregates, and number and surface of lymphatic vessels were evaluated using a computer-assisted digital videocamera microscope (Nikon digital sigh, DS-2Mv). The number of lymphatic vessels increased from NT [3 (range, 2 to 13)] to BG [8 (range, 5 to 9)] to HT [12.5 (range, 10 to 16)]. A significant statistical difference was observed within the group (P=0.003): HT differed from NT (P=0.016) and BG (P=0.002). The area of lymphatic vessels increased from NT [0.01 mm (range, 0.01 to 0.12 mm2)] to BG [0.03 mm2 (range, 0.01 to 0.19 mm2)] to HT [0.03 mm (range, 0.01 to 0.6 mm2)]. A significant statistical difference was observed among the groups (P=0.001): NT differed from HT (P<0.001) and from BG (P<0.001). Lymphatic vessels showed valves, perivascular lymphoid aggregates, and intravascular lymphocytes. The cracking spaces shown by Hashimoto are mainly lymphatic vessels and represent a characteristic feature of autoimmune thyroid diseases."

Morphologic features derived using automated image analysis systems may be more objective and reproducible than manual systems, which require humans to segment nuclei from histologic images. STUDY DESIGN: Images of hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of prostate tissue microarray were analyzed independently using the automated and manual systems. Mean optical density (MOD), nuclear area (NA), and nuclear roundness factor (NRF) were the morphologic features studied. The ability to differentiate between tissue types using morphologic features derived from an automated and a manual system was compared. RESULTS: Nuclei from 17 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), 4 HGPIN, and 8 aggressive CaP were analyzed. The manual system distinguished better between BPH and HGPIN (p < 0.0001), whereas the automated system distinguished better between BPH and CaP (p = 0.01) in multivariate models. The manual system distinguished better BPH and HGPIN using NA (p < 0.0001) and MOD (p < 0.0001), whereas the automated system distinguished better BPH and CaP using MOD (p < 0.0001) and NRF (p = 0.004).

Epub 2010 Jan 18.,Jotz GP,J Voice,2011,2010/01/20,,,10.1016/j.jvoice.2009.06.007,"Histological studies of the human recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) have described differences in fiber length and thickness between the right and left RLNs. This asymmetry is probably involved in the different times of arrival of the stimuli to the laryngeal musculature controlled by each nerve. Histological and structural differences between the right and left RLNs could explain the synchronicity of laryngeal musculature contraction despite the differing nerve lengths. The purpose of this investigation was to shed some light on this paradigm by obtaining estimates of some morphometric parameters, such as intraperineural area, intraperineural perimeter, fiber area, fiber perimeter, fiber density (number of fibers/mm(2)), and total number of fibers in the right and left RLN of humans. Thus, the right and left RLNs were studied in a total sample of eight human specimens obtained from necropsies. The nerves were analyzed using histology, and the morphometric parameters were measured using Image Pro Plus Software 4.1 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). No statistical differences between the two RLNs were observed in the intraperineural area, intraperineural perimeter, density (number of fibers/mm(2)), and total number of fibers. However, the area and perimeter of fibers of the right RLN were statistically larger when compared with those of the left RLN--21% and 11%, respectively. In conclusion, we show that in humans, the area and perimeter of the right RLN are larger than those of the left RLN. This morphological finding is probably related to the different time of arrival of the stimulus to the laryngeal musculature."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with solid breast masses examined between May 2007 and May 2008 in the Radiology Department of Cluj District University Hospital were included in the study. All lesions were examined with conventional ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound and sonoelastography, according to a preset protocol. The influence of the following factors on the elastographic score was evaluated: type of section (sagittal versus transverse); size of region of interest (small versus large); amplitude and frequency of movement; initial compression (light versus strong); angulation (perpendicular versus angulated transducer); characteristics of the lesion (size and location). The reference diagnosis was the histopathology diagnosis and, in twenty cases, short-term follow-up. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients with a mean age of 48.11 years and 101 breast nodules were included in the study. The overall sensitivity and specificity for elastography were 79 % [68-88 %] and 79 % [65 - 89 %], respectively, with a negative predictive value of 74 % [60-85 %] and a positive predictive value of 84 % [72-91 %]. The following factors did not influence the elastographic score: type of section (scores on transverse and longitudinal section, Z = -0.641, p = 0.552); the amplitude and frequency of movements during the elastographic examination (Cochran's Q concordance = 0.706, p = 0.872); strong initial compression in the case of benign nodules (Z = 0.000, p = 1.000); size of the lesions. Of the elastographically benign nodules, 9 were false negative and of the 46 elastographically malignant nodules, 12 were false positive. The following factors influenced the elastographic scores: size of the region of interest (the scores were significantly different when small or large region of interest was used, Z = -0.671, p < 0.0001); transducer angulation (Z = -5.42, p < 0.0001); strong initial compression in the case of malignant nodules (Z = -6.044, p < 0.0001) and the location of the mass in the vicinity of the chest wall. CONCLUSION: The most important factors that influence the final elastographic score, leading to false negative results, are the size of the region of interest, the initial compression and angulation of the transducer, while the frequency and amplitude of movement during the examination proved to be of no importance as long as the images were obtained within a range of assessment usefulness. Changing the scanning parameters never led to false positive results in the case of malignant breast masses."

Epub 2010 Dec 7.,Fahmy NZ,J Prosthodont,2011,2010/12/09,,,10.1111/j.1532-849X.2010.00626.x,"PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to assess the influence of three-veneering materials on the marginal fit, fracture resistance, and failure pattern of In-Ceram alumina crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty In-Ceram cores were constructed and divided into four groups of ten each. Ten alumina cores were left unveneered, forming the first group for core testing, while the other 30 copings were divided into three groups depending on the veneering material used. The vertical marginal gaps of the alumina copings were measured before and after veneer placement at 16 sites using an optical microscope. The specimens were then loaded to fracture at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Fractured specimens were examined, and the fracture patterns of the crowns were recorded. Selected specimens were examined using scanning electron microscope. Data were presented as means and standard deviation values. One-way ANOVA was used to compare between mean gap areas and fracture resistance of the three materials. Duncan's post hoc test was used for pairwise comparison between the means when ANOVA test was significant. RESULTS: Vitadur-N-veneered crowns showed statistically the highest mean vertical gaps, while no significant difference was evident between the marginal fits of Vitadur-alpha- and VM7-veneered crowns. Regarding the strength, a statistically significant decrease in fracture resistance of the cores was evident after veneering with Vitadur-N; however, no significant change in mean fracture resistance value of Vitadur-alpha- and VM7-veneered crowns was evident compared to the alumina cores. VM7-veneered crowns showed the highest fracture resistance values. CONCLUSIONS: Vitadur-N-veneered crowns showed the highest mean vertical gaps and the lowest mean fracture resistance values of the tested groups, while VM7-veneered crowns combined the highest fracture resistance values and clinically acceptable margins. The best interface quality and finest ceramic texture were evident in case of VM7 material."

Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an intra-axial round-shaped isointense mass homogeneously enhanced with gadolinium in the right cerebellar hemisphere, as well as perifocal edema extending to the brain stem and right thalamus. The tumor was elastic hard and was resected en bloc with a clear margin. Histological examination revealed IMT with spindle cells and collagen, but negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase expression. IMT most commonly affects the lung, but may involve many other parts of the body. There is some debate regarding the disease entity of IMT in the central nervous system (IMT-CNS) because of its rarity and high frequency of recurrence. IMT-CNS is an important differential diagnosis among tumor-like intracranial lesions and total resection is required."

With the present introduction of robust scanners for whole slide imaging in both research and routine, the benefits of automation and objectivity in the analysis of tissue sections will be even more obvious. For in situ studies of signal transduction, the combination of tissue microarrays, immunohistochemistry, digital imaging, and quantitative image analysis will be central operations. However, immunohistochemistry is a multistep procedure including a lot of technical pitfalls leading to intra- and interlaboratory variability of its outcome. The resulting variations in staining intensity and disruption of original morphology are an extra challenge for the image analysis software, which therefore preferably should be dedicated to the detection and quantification of histomorphometrical end points."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty roots with canals with regular morphology were prepared to apical size #30 and were filled with gutta-percha/AHPlus using lateral condensation. Digital radiographs of teeth were captured. After two weeks, canals were retreated to size 40 using ProTaper rotary instruments, without solvent. Roots were embedded in resin blocks and reduced incrementally at four different apical levels (at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm from the apical foramen). The sectioned surfaces were observed under a metallographic optical microscope and digital micrographic images were captured and processed. Perimeter covered with root-filling residue was expressed as percentage of total canal perimeter for all specimens. RESULTS: Residue percentage was greater at 2.00 mm from apical level than at other levels. Most residue of filling material in all specimens was observed at 0.5 and at 2.0 mm from apex. The use of ProTaper instruments allowed the removal of gutta-percha and AHPlus sealer in the apical 2 mm in average 50% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting morphology of the prepared canals allowed root fillings performed with gutta-percha and AHPlus sealer that were efficiently removed by using rotary instruments. More material residue was found adhering to the canal walls in the apical segments of canals. The removal of this residue was enhanced by apical enlargement beyond the diameter of the canal before retreatment."

The development of whole slide scanners permits the creation of virtual slides and to work on so-called virtual microscopes. In addition to interactive work on virtual slides approaches have been reported that introduce automated virtual microscopy, which is composed of several tools focusing on quite different tasks. These include evaluation of image quality and image standardization, analysis of potential useful thresholds for object detection and identification (segmentation), dynamic segmentation procedures, adjustable magnification to optimize feature extraction, and texture analysis including image transformation and evaluation of elementary primitives. Grid technology seems to possess all features to efficiently target and control the specific tasks of image information and detection in order to obtain a detailed and accurate diagnosis. Grid technology is based upon so-called nodes that are linked together and share certain communication rules in using open standards. Their number and functionality can vary according to the needs of a specific user at a given point in time. When implementing automated virtual microscopy with Grid technology, all of the five different Grid functions have to be taken into account, namely 1) computation services, 2) data services, 3) application services, 4) information services, and 5) knowledge services. Although all mandatory tools of automated virtual microscopy can be implemented in a closed or standardized open system, Grid technology offers a new dimension to acquire, detect, classify, and distribute medical image information, and to assure quality in tissue-based diagnosis."

Seven patients (5 good responders and 2 poor responders) with presumptive stage IA endometrial adenocarcinoma treated with 600 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate were reviewed. Epithelial cell size and stromal area observable on microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, and immunostaining labeling indices for Ki-67 nuclear antigen, single-stranded DNA, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor were semiquantitatively analyzed before treatment and after 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of treatment using computer imaging programs. The mean ratio of cell size after 4 weeks of treatment to that before treatment in good responders was 3.83, whereas the ratios in the 2 poor responders were 1.08 and 0.98. The mean Ki-67 nuclear antigen labeling index before treatment was 37.2% for the 5 good responders but was 51.0% in the 2 poor responders. The indices of the poor responders remained high (20%-77%), even after 16 weeks of treatment; in contrast, the indices of the good responders were low (0.4%-7.3%) throughout the treatment period. No definitive differences in labeling indices for single-stranded DNA, estrogen receptor, or progesterone receptor were observed between good and poor responders or at different stages of treatment (p>0.05). In conclusion, a higher epithelial cell size ratio after 4 weeks of treatment in conjunction with lower Ki-67 nuclear antigen labeling indices could be a potential predictor of hormonal response."

Lateral incisors (n = 32), 16 with curvature angles smaller or equal to 10 masculine (GI) and 16 between 11 masculine and 25 masculine angles (GII) were submitted to Hero 642 rotary instrumentation with different surgical diameters: (A) 30.02 and (B) 45.02. Irrigation was performed at each change of instrument with 5 mL of ultrapure Milli-Q water and the extruded material through the apical foramen was collected. Root cross-sections were subjected to histological analysis by optical microscopy (x40) and the images were evaluated morphometrically using the Image Tool software. Quantification of the extruded material was performed by weighing after liquid evaporation. ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences (p>0.05) among the groups with respect to the procedures used to clean the apical region. Considering the amount of extruded material, the Tukey's HSD showed that canals with mild curvature prepared with the 45.02 surgical diameter showed significantly higher values (p<0.05) that those of the other groups, which were similar between themselves (p>0.05). In conclusion, the effect of cleaning the apical region did not differ in the groups, considering root curvature and the surgical diameter of instruments used for apical preparation. The amount of extruded material was greater in canals with mild curvature that were prepared with the 45.02 surgical instrument diameter."

With the current manual interpretive morphological approaches typically employed by surgical pathologists to assess tumor extent, the specialty now potentially has stumbled upon a crossroads of practice, where the diagnostic criteria have exceeded the capabilities of our commonly available tools. While whole slide imaging (WSI) technology holds the potential to offer many improvements in clinical workflow over conventional slide microscopy including unambiguous utility for facilitating quantitative diagnostic tasks with one important example being the determination of both linear dimension and surface area. However, the availability of histology data in digital form is of little utility if time-consuming and cumbersome manual workflow steps are necessarily imposed upon the pathologist in order to generate such measurements, especially as encountered with the complex and ill-defined shapes inherent to infiltrative tumors. In this communication, we demonstrate the utility of the recently described SIVQ algorithm to serve as the basis of a highly accurate, precise and semi-automated tool for direct surface area measurement of tumor infiltration from WSI data sets. By anticipating the current trend in cancer staging that emphasizes increasingly precise feature characterization, as witnessed by the recent publication of AJCC's 7th edition of the Cancer Staging Manual, this tool holds promise to will be of value to pathologists for clinical utility."

Moreover, we leverage a novel algorithm for propagating segmentation constraints through the image stack via optimal volumetric pathways, thereby allowing our method to compute highly accurate 3D segmentations from very sparse user input. We evaluate our method by reconstructing 16 neural processes in a 1024 x 1024 x 50 nanometer-scale EM image stack of a mouse hippocampus. We demonstrate that, on average, our method is 68% more accurate than previous state-of-the-art semi-automatic methods."

In this paper we advocate a discriminative learning approach for cellular image segmentation. In particular, three new features are proposed to capture the appearance, shape and context information, respectively. Experiments are conducted on three different cellular image datasets. Despite the significant disparity among these datasets, the proposed approach is demonstrated to perform reasonably well. As expected, for a particular dataset, some features turn out to be more suitable than others. Interestingly, we observe that a further gain can often be obtained on top of using the ""good"" features, by also retaining those features that perform poorly. This might be due to the complementary nature of these features, as well as the capacity of our approach to better integrate and exploit different sources of information."

However, most of these shape-based methods are computationally expensive. There are instances in an image where no overlapping objects are present and applying these schemes results in significant computational overhead without any accompanying, additional benefit. In this paper we present a novel adaptive active contour scheme (AdACM) that combines boundary and region based energy terms with a shape prior in a multi level set formulation. To reduce the computational overhead, the shape prior term in the variational formulation is only invoked for those instances in the image where overlaps between objects are identified; these overlaps being identified via a contour concavity detection scheme. By not having to invoke all 3 terms (shape, boundary, region) for segmenting every object in the scene, the computational expense of the integrated active contour model is dramatically reduced, a particularly relevant consideration when multiple objects have to be segmented on very large histopathological images. The AdACM was employed for the task of segmenting nuclei on 80 prostate cancer tissue microarray images. Morphological features extracted from these segmentations were found to able to discriminate different Gleason grade patterns with a classification accuracy of 84% via a Support Vector Machine classifier. On average the AdACM model provided 100% savings in computational times compared to a non-optimized hybrid AC model involving a shape prior."

Modeling the scene with dynamic textures, we derive two likelihood functions to account for both spatial and temporal discrepancies of the motion patterns. A tubular shape prior is moreover introduced to constrain the aortic region. Extensive experiments on microscopic sequences quantitatively show the good performance of our approach."

As no single generally applicable tumor biomarker is available, pathology routinely uses morphological criteria as a spatial reference system. We here present and evaluate a method capable of performing the classification in immunofluorescence histological slides solely using a DAPI background stain. Due to the restriction to a single color channel this is inherently challenging. We formed cell graphs based on the topological distribution of the tissue cell nuclei and extracted the corresponding graph features. By using topological, morphological and intensity based features we could systematically quantify and compare the discrimination capability individual features contribute to the overall algorithm. We here show that when classifying fluorescence tissue slides in the DAPI channel, morphological and intensity based features clearly outpace topological ones which have been used exclusively in related previous approaches. We assembled the 15 best features to train a support vector machine based on Keratin stained tumor areas. On a test set of TMAs with 210 cores of triple negative breast cancers our classifier was able to distinguish between tumor and stroma tissue with a total overall accuracy of 88%. Our method yields first results on the discrimination capability of features groups which is essential for an automated tumor diagnostics. Also, it provides an objective spatial reference system for the multiplex analysis of biomarkers in fluorescence immunohistochemistry."

Perfusion of adhered platelets with plasma under coagulating conditions at a low shear rate (250(-1)) resulted in the assembly of a star-like fibrin network at the platelet surface. The focal fibrin formation on platelets was preceded by rises in cytosolic Ca(2+), morphologic changes, and phosphatidylserine exposure. Fibrin formation was slightly affected by alpha(IIb)beta(3) blockage, but it was greatly delayed and reduced by the following: inhibition of thrombin or platelet activation; interference in the binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to glycoprotein Ib/V/IX (GpIb-V-IX); plasma or blood from patients with type 1 von Willebrand disease; and plasma from mice deficient in VWF or the extracellular domain of GpIbalpha. In this process, the GpIb-binding A1 domain of VWF was similarly effective as full-length VWF. Prestimulation of platelets enhanced the formation of fibrin, which was abrogated by blockage of phosphatidylserine. Together, these results show that, in the presence of thrombin and low shear flow, VWF-induced activation of GpIb-V-IX triggers platelet procoagulant activity and anchorage of a star-like fibrin network. This process can be relevant in hemostasis and the manifestation of von Willebrand disease."
21269474,Enhanced virtual microscopy for collaborative education,"Triola MM, Holloway WJ.",BMC Med Educ. 2011 Jan 26;11:4. doi: 10.1186/1472-6920-11-4.,Triola MM,BMC Med Educ,2011,2011/01/29,PMC3037351,,10.1186/1472-6920-11-4,"BACKGROUND: Curricular reform efforts and a desire to use novel educational strategies that foster student collaboration are challenging the traditional microscope-based teaching of histology. Computer-based histology teaching tools and Virtual Microscopes (VM), computer-based digital slide viewers, have been shown to be effective and efficient educational strategies. We developed an open-source VM system based on the Google Maps engine to transform our histology education and introduce new teaching methods. This VM allows students and faculty to collaboratively create content, annotate slides with markers, and it is enhanced with social networking features to give the community of learners more control over the system. RESULTS: We currently have 1,037 slides in our VM system comprised of 39,386,941 individual JPEG files that take up 349 gigabytes of server storage space. Of those slides 682 are for general teaching and available to our students and the public; the remaining 355 slides are used for practical exams and have restricted access. The system has seen extensive use with 289,352 unique slide views to date. Students viewed an average of 56.3 slides per month during the histology course and accessed the system at all hours of the day. Of the 621 annotations added to 126 slides 26.2% were added by faculty and 73.8% by students. The use of the VM system reduced the amount of time faculty spent administering the course by 210 hours, but did not reduce the number of laboratory sessions or the number of required faculty. Laboratory sessions were reduced from three hours to two hours each due to the efficiencies in the workflow of the VM system. CONCLUSIONS: Our virtual microscope system has been an effective solution to the challenges facing traditional histopathology laboratories and the novel needs of our revised curriculum. The web-based system allowed us to empower learners to have greater control over their content, as well as the ability to work together in collaborative groups. The VM system saved faculty time and there was no significant difference in student performance on an identical practical exam before and after its adoption. We have made the source code of our VM freely available and encourage use of the publically available slides on our website."

Distinct histological features are distinguishable based on the morphology of the tumor. Differences in nuclei size and shape are often observed in osteosarcoma reflecting its broad histopathological heterogeneity. This study explores the relevance of two nuclear parameters in osteosarcoma: large area and round shape. Computerized nuclear morphometry was performed in 56 conventional osteosarcoma preoperative biopsies. The mean patient follow-up time was 35.1 months. Based on the nuclear area, no significant difference (P = 0.09) in overall survival between patients with large (> 42.5 mum(2)) and small (< 42.5 mum(2)) tumor nuclei was found. However, when cases with large and round nuclei were analyzed jointly (> 42.5 mum(2) and coefficient of nuclear roundness > 0.7), these two parameters together were likely to be a predictive factor (P = 0.05). Osteosarcoma patients with large and round tumor nuclei had a better outcome than patients with small and polymorphic (ovoid or spindle-shaped) nuclei. In this study, nuclear morphometry proved to be a useful tool to shed light on the biology of osteosarcoma showing that some morphometric parameters can be easily applied to help identifying patients with a good prognosis."

In normal subjects, these two networks overlap partially on the supra-temporal plane, suggesting that some early-stage auditory areas are involved in processing of either auditory feature alone or of both. Using high-resolution 7-T fMRI we have investigated the influence of positional information on sound object representations by comparing activation patterns to environmental sounds lateralised to the right or left ear. While unilaterally presented sounds induced bilateral activation, small clusters in specific non-primary auditory areas were significantly more activated by contra-laterally presented stimuli. Comparison of these data with histologically identified non-primary auditory areas suggests that the coding of sound objects within early-stage auditory areas lateral and posterior to primary auditory cortex AI is modulated by the position of the sound, while that within anterior areas is not."

To coordinate with this new technique, it is essential to automate the process of extracting information from such high amount of images. In this paper, we present a new model called the Subspace Mumford-Shah model for texture segmentation of microscopic endometrial images. The model incorporates subspace clustering techniques into a Mumford-Shah model to solve texture segmentation problems. The method first uses a supervised procedure to determine several optimal subspaces. These subspaces are then embedded into a Mumford-Shah objective function so that each segment of the optimal partition is homogeneous in its own subspace. The method outperforms a widely used method in bioimaging community called k-means segmentation since it can separate textures which are less separated in the full feature space, which confirm the usefulness of subspace clustering in texture segmentation. Experimental results also show that the proposed method is well performed on diagnosing premalignant endometrial disease and is very practical for segmenting image set sharing similar properties."

Epub 2010 Dec 16.,Adamietz BR,Ultraschall Med,2011,2010/12/18,,,10.1055/s-0029-1245821,"PURPOSE: Elastography is a new ultrasonographic method that has been examined as a diagnostic tool for breast lesions. This study was intended to create and define new elastographic criteria allowing assessment of whether breast lesions are malignant or benign. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 217 patients with a total of 245 breast lesions of unknown malignancy underwent ultrasound examination. The new eSie Touch Elasticity Imaging technology (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used with a 10-MHz linear transducer (Acuson Antares). Lesions were examined using B-mode and real-time elastography (RTE). Each lesion was histologically assessed by core biopsy. Five RTE characteristics were examined: elasticity proportion (EP), different location on RTE in comparison with B-mode (MV), different contrast patterns (SOS), dorsal lesion limitation visibility and different size on RTE in comparison with B-mode. RESULTS: 54 malignant lesions (54 %) appeared inelastic, in contrast to the benign control group (34.5 %; P = 0.001). A completely elastic pattern was visible in 10 malignant (10 %) and 39 benign lesions (26.9 %). MV was identified in 23 cases, with 22 of the lesions being malignant and one benign. The SOS was negative in 89 malignant lesions (89 %) and positive in 100 benign lesions. The dorsal lesion limitation was visible on RTE without B-mode in 88 malignant lesions (88 %) and 27 benign lesions (18.6 %). The size was assessed as larger in 45 malignant lesions (45 %) and seven benign lesions (4.8 %). CONCLUSION: SOS and a larger tumor size on RTE are specific characteristics of malignant breast lesions. EP, MV and distal mass border are further helpful signs to assess the malignancy of tumors."

A reduction in observer variability using computer aids could enhance the statistical power of studies designed to determine the utility of new biomarkers and accelerate their incorporation in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: To quantify interobserver and intraobserver variability in immunohistochemical analysis of HER2/neu with digital microscopy and computer-aided digital microscopy, and to test the hypothesis that observer agreement in the quantitative assessment of HER2/neu immunohistochemical expression is increased with the use of computer-aided microscopy. DESIGN: A set of 335 digital microscopy images extracted from 64 breast cancer tissue slides stained with a HER2 antibody, were read by 14 observers in 2 reading modes: the unaided mode and the computer-aided mode. In the unaided mode, HER2 images were displayed on a calibrated color monitor with no other information, whereas in the computer-aided mode, observers were shown a HER2 image along with a corresponding feature plot showing computer-extracted values of membrane staining intensity and membrane completeness for the particular image under examination and, at the same time, mean feature values of the different HER2 categories. In both modes, observers were asked to provide a continuous score of HER2 expression. RESULTS: Agreement analysis performed on the output of the study showed significant improvement in both interobserver and intraobserver agreement when the computer-aided reading mode was used to evaluate preselected image fields. CONCLUSION: The role of computer-aided digital microscopy in reducing observer variability in immunohistochemistry is promising."

One third of patients show a single circumscribed focus. Enucleation of the focus and the removal of all affected beta-cells with preservation of healthy tissue is the treatment of choice. The intrapancreatic choledochus as well as the ductus pancreaticus major must remain intact. The diagnostic gold standard is 18F-DOPA-PET/CT. Intraoperative sonography is carried out to correctly visualize the focus preoperatively localized by PET/CT in situ during the operation. The enucleation of the focus was carried out 3 - 20 days after PET/CT in 5 patients at an age of 3.5 - 14 months. Intraoperative ultrasound was carried out with high-capacity devices of different manufacturers under use of broadband probes (9 - 14 MHz). The localization by intraoperative ultrasound was accurate in all 5 patients with focal CHI, with regard to the intraoperative localization as previously described by PET/CT and histology. D. choledochus and D. pancreaticus major were separated intraoperatively by ultrasound. 3 of 5 patients were cured by complete enucleation of the focus. Nevertheless, the entire intraoperative identification of the segmented focus is still problematic. Characteristic sonographic features of a CHI focus are: hypoechogenicity, variable homogeneous and inhomogenous texture, blurred, irregular limitation without capsule, filiform, lobular processes, and insular dispersal into the surrounding tissue. Intraoperative high-resolution sonography helps the pediatric surgeon to determine size, configuration and topography of a CHI focus."

Previous studies have demonstrated that two-photon autofluorescence microscopy (2PAM) can be used for noninvasive, three-dimensional imaging of epithelial tissues down to approximately 150 mum beneath the skin surface. We report ex-vivo 2PAM images of epithelial tissue from a human tongue biopsy down to 370 mum below the surface. At greater than 320 mum deep, the fluorescence generated outside the focal volume degrades the image contrast to below one. We demonstrate that these imaging depths can be reached with 160 mW of laser power (2-nJ per pulse) from a conventional 80-MHz repetition rate ultrafast laser oscillator. To better understand the maximum imaging depths that we can achieve in epithelial tissues, we studied image contrast as a function of depth in tissue phantoms with a range of relevant optical properties. The phantom data agree well with the estimated contrast decays from time-resolved Monte Carlo simulations and show maximum imaging depths similar to that found in human biopsy results. This work demonstrates that the low staining inhomogeneity ( approximately  20) and large scattering coefficient ( approximately  10 mm(-1)) associated with conventional 2PAM limit the maximum imaging depth to 3 to 5 mean free scattering lengths deep in epithelial tissue."

The aim of this study was to assess the value of real-time tissue elastography, using an instrument made in Japan, for the visible measurement of liver elasticity; in particular, comparing the results with those of transient elastography (Fibroscan). METHODS: Real-time tissue elastography (RTE), transient elastography (Fibroscan), liver biopsy, and routine laboratory analyses were performed in 101 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The values for tissue elasticity obtained using novel software (Elasto_ver 1.5.1) connected to RTE were transferred to four image features, Mean, Standard Deviation (SD), Area, and Complexity. Their association with the stage of fibrosis at biopsy and with liver stiffness (kPa) obtained by Fibroscan was analyzed. RESULTS: Colored images obtained by RTE were classified into diffuse soft, intermediate, and patchy hard patterns and the calculated elasticity differed significantly between patients according to and correlated with the stages of fibrosis (p < 0.0001). Mean, SD, Area, and Complexity showed significant differences between the stages of fibrosis (Tukey-Kramer test, p < 0.05). In discriminating patients with cirrhosis, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were 0.91 for Mean, 0.84 for SD, 0.91 for Area, 0.93 for Complexity, and 0.95 for Fibroscan. CONCLUSIONS: RTE is a noninvasive instrument for the colored visualization of liver elasticity in patients with chronic liver disease."

Precise quantitative information about nuclear structure and morphology, however, is currently not available for many diagnostic challenges. This is due, in part, to the lack of methods to quantify these differences from image data. We describe a method to characterize and contrast the distribution of nuclear structure in different tissue classes (normal, benign, cancer, etc.). The approach is based on quantifying chromatin morphology in different groups of cells using the optimal transportation (Kantorovich-Wasserstein) metric in combination with the Fisher discriminant analysis and multidimensional scaling techniques. We show that the optimal transportation metric is able to measure relevant biological information as it enables automatic determination of the class (e.g., normal versus cancer) of a set of nuclei. We show that the classification accuracies obtained using this metric are, on average, as good or better than those obtained utilizing a set of previously described numerical features. We apply our methods to two diagnostic challenges for surgical pathology: one in the liver and one in the thyroid. Results automatically computed using this technique show potentially biologically relevant differences in nuclear structure in liver and thyroid cancers."

White areas, prominent in early malignant melanoma and melanoma in situ, contribute to early detection of these lesions. An adaptive detection method has been investigated to identify white and hypopigmented areas based on lesion histogram statistics. Using the Euclidean distance transform, the lesion is segmented in concentric deciles. Overlays of the white areas on the lesion deciles are determined. Calculated features of automatically detected white areas include lesion decile ratios, normalized number of white areas, absolute and relative size of largest white area, relative size of all white areas, and white area eccentricity, dispersion, and irregularity. Using a back-propagation neural network, the white area statistics yield over 95% diagnostic accuracy of melanomas from benign nevi. White and hypopigmented areas in melanomas tend to be central or paracentral. The four most powerful features on multivariate analysis are lesion decile ratios. Automatic detection of white and hypopigmented areas in melanoma can be accomplished using lesion statistics. A neural network can achieve good discrimination of melanomas from benign nevi using these areas. Lesion decile ratios are useful white area features."

The expansion of the polyQ domain results in the ordered assembly of htt fragments into fibrillar aggregates that are the main constituents of inclusion bodies, which are a hallmark of the disease. This paper describes protocols for studying the aggregation of mutant htt fragments and synthetic polyQ peptides with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Ex situ AFM is used to characterize aggregate formation in protein incubation as a function of time. Methods to quickly and unambiguously distinguish specific aggregate species from complex, heterogeneous aggregation reactions based on simple morphological features are presented. Finally, the application of time lapse atomic force microscopy in solution is presented for studying synthetic model polyQ peptides, which allows for tracking the formation and fate of individual aggregates on surfaces over time. This ability allows for dynamic studies of the aggregation process and direct observation of the interplay between different types of aggregates."

Fractal analysis has been proposed as a useful descriptor of tumor microvascularity. Standardization of the fractal analysis methodology could offer a new tool for this type of characterization. In this study, we applied fractal analysis to the characterization of the different angioarchitectures found in specimens of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and most malignant type of human brain tumor. A retrospective series of 114 primary GBM specimens was carried out. To quantify neoplastic microvascularity, the level of two-dimensional geometrical complexity of the microvascular patterns was assessed using the box-counting algorithm, which estimates the microvascular fractal dimension (mvFD). mvFD makes information on the non-Euclidean space filled by vessels embedded in the tumor microenvironment available because it depends on vessel number, shape, magnitude and distribution pattern. A mean mvFD value of 1.44 +/- 0.17 (range: 1.06-1.87) was found. The coefficient of variation was 44%. The high geometric variability, found objectively, in these samples reflects the angioarchitectural heterogeneity underlying GBM. The present study shows that angioarchitectural subtypes can be identified by mvFD, making this parameter a potential tool for quantifying different neoplastic microvascular patterns."

Our proposed framework departs from previous methods in that we include domain-specific diagnostic features in a probabilistic manner using conditional random fields. Likewise, we provide a novel window-based performance assessment scheme for 2D image analysis which addresses the intrinsic problem of image misalignment. Image regions corresponding to different tissue types are indentified for the extraction of domain-specific anatomical features. The unique optical properties of each tissue type and the diagnostic relationships between neighboring regions are incorporated in the proposed conditional random field model. The validity of our method is examined using clinical data from 48 patients, and its diagnostic potential is demonstrated by a performance comparison with expert colposcopy annotations, using histopathology as the ground truth. The proposed automated diagnostic approach can support or potentially replace conventional colposcopy, allow tissue specimen sampling to be performed in a more objective manner, and lower the number of cervical cancer cases in developing countries by providing a cost effective screening solution in low-resource settings."

Detection of morphological features of these cells is highly desired when routinely identifying circulating tumor cells (CTC) in blood of patients. We have designed an image cytometer intended for fast and sensitive routine analysis of CTC. After an initial scan, prospective events can be revisited for more detailed analysis. The image cytometer features: 375, 491, and 639 nm laser lines, a 40x/0.6NA objective, a CCD camera operating in TDI mode, servo stages to move the sample in two dimensions and a piezo microscope objective positioner to move the objective in the third dimension. ImageJ is used for dedicated image analysis. A homogeneous illumination area, measuring 180 x 180 mum(2) , was created by the use of a rotating diffuser in combination with two micro-lens arrays. For feed-forward automatic focusing of the sample during a scan, a 3D spline was fitted through 30 predetermined focus positions before scanning the sample. Continuous signal acquisition is made possible by using a CCD operating in TDI mode synchronized to the movement of two servo scan stages. The limit of fluorescence sensitivity is 120 PE molecules on a bead with a diameter of 6.8 mum, at a scanning speed of 1.0 mm s(-1) . The resolution of the imaging system is 0.76 mum in the TDI scan direction at a wavelength of 580 nm. Identification of cells is facilitated by scatter plots of the fluorescent parameters in which each individual event can be viewed for its morphological features by fluorescence as well as bright field. The image cytometer measures quantitative fluorescence and morphological features at a high sensitivity, high resolution, and with minimal overhead time. It has the ability torelocate events of interest for further detailed analysis. The system can be used for routine identification and characterization of rare cells."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 11 women who underwent pelvic MRI before and >120 days following UAE. MRI included conventional and diffusion weighted imaging sequences. Percentage change in leiomyoma volume was determined by multiplanar T2-weighted imaging. A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between leiomyoma VR following UAE and the following pre-embolization parameters: initial volume, relative enhancement, relative T2 signal intensity (SI) and ADC. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ADC for predicting volumetric response. RESULTS: Twenty-eight leiomyomas were included with a mean interval from UAE to follow-up MRI of 207 days. The preprocedural volume of the leiomyomas ranged from 18 to 182 cm(3) (median 47 cm(3)). and ADC ranged from 0.37 to 1.71 mm(2)/s (mean 0.80 mm(2)/s). All leiomyomas were 100% necrotic following UAE. Leiomyoma VR following UAE was 48% +/- 3.5%. with significant correlation between VR and ADC (r = 0.41; P = 0.017) but no correlation with initial leiomyoma volume, relative T2 SI, or relative enhancement. Using a threshold of 0.875 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, ADC could predict > 50% VR with sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 83%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pre-UAE ADC of leiomyomas correlated significantly with percent VR following UAE. In contrast, no correlation was seen between VR post-UAE and conventional imaging findings. This suggests that VR following UAE depends on leiomyoma histology reflected in DWI rather than features revealed by conventional MRI."

All subjects (10AD and 15 healthy controls [HC]) underwent a MRI scanning at 1.5 T, including a 3-dimensional volumetric scan and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We performed statistical parametric mapping (SPM) with DTI to evaluate the patterns of the microscopic WM changes, as well as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for GM and WM volume changes between patients with AD and HC. GM atrophy was detected, mainly in posterior regions, and WM atrophy was similarly distributed, but less involved on VBM analysis. Unlike WM atrophy on VBM analysis, microscopic WM changes were shown in the medial frontal, orbitofrontal, splenium of the corpus callosum, and cingulum on DTI analysis with SPM. We demonstrated that the pattern of macroscopic WM atrophy was similar to GM atrophy, while microscopic WM changes had a different pattern and distribution. Our findings suggest that WM atrophy may preferentially reflect the secondary changes of GM atrophy, while microscopic WM changes start earlier in frontal areas before GM and WM atrophy can be detected macroscopically."

Epub 2010 Nov 23.,Grgurevic I,Ultraschall Med,2011,2010/11/25,,,10.1055/s-0029-1245807,"PURPOSE: To evaluate acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) of the liver and spleen as a new method for the noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis (LF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups of 58 examinees were studied: (A) 20 healthy volunteers; (B) 18 patients with chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) B or C having liver fibrosis stages F 1 - 4 (assessed by liver biopsy; Ishak classification); and (C) 20 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). All participants were examined using the Siemens ACUSON S 2000 Ultrasound Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification system. Ten measurements were performed on both liver lobes and three measurements on the spleen, and the obtained mean values (shear wave velocities [SWV] expressed in m/s) were compared between the groups. In 20 patients the splenic artery pulsatility index (SAPI) was also measured and correlated to the liver and splenic ARFI and histological stage of LF. RESULTS: Hepatic ARFI measurements demonstrated a significant correlation to LB results (Spearman's rho = 0.766; rho < 0.001) and SWV cut-off values of 1.3 (AUC 0.96) and 1.86 (AUC 0.99) could reliably differentiate between healthy (A) and non-cirrhotic CVH (B), as well as between non-cirrhotic CVH (B) and LC (C). Splenic SWV cut-off value of 2.73 (AUC 0.82) could differentiate between the patients with LC and non-cirrhotic CVH. A significant correlation was also observed between the SAPI and liver ARFI results (rho = 0.56; p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: The hepatic and splenic SWV measured by ARFI increase with the LF stage, and the hepatic SWV correlate well with SAPI. This new technology enables simultaneous morphological, Doppler and elastometric examinations and might improve the accuracy of noninvasive liver fibrosis assessment."

OBJECTIVE: To better identify the frontostriatal pathways in the human brain, we used a fiber-dissection technique to reconstruct neural connections between the frontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), which is the most ventral extent of the striatum. METHODS: Thirty previously frozen, formalin-fixed human brains were dissected under the operating microscope using a modified fiber-dissection technique, primarily reported by Klingler. RESULTS: Our serial dissections of 30 human brain specimens clearly demonstrated that projection fibers form a connection between the NAcc and the frontal lobe. We evidenced this newly described subcortical tract as an accumbofrontal fasciculus. This focal projection was concentrated at the level of the ventromedial part of the NAcc and characterized by an elective and specific projection from the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, particularly the gyrus rectus and the medial orbital gyrus situated between the H-shaped and the medial orbital sulcus. CONCLUSION: The accumbofrontal fasciculus is an elective and specific projection from the orbitoprefrontal cortex. This fasciculus is part of a corticostriatothalamocortical loop and a putative target for deep-brain stimulation in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depression. The analysis of in vivo diffusion tractography, used today as a standard in the investigation of many brain disorders, could potentially take advantage of complementary anatomic correlations and functional extrapolations, as described in this study."
21271263,Anatomic relations of the arachnoidea around the pituitary stalk: relevance for surgical removal of craniopharyngiomas,"Qi S, Lu Y, Pan J, Zhang X, Long H, Fan J.",Acta Neurochir (Wien). 2011 Apr;153(4):785-96. doi: 10.1007/s00701-010-0940-y. Epub 2011 Jan 27.,Qi S,Acta Neurochir (Wien),2011,2011/01/29,PMC3059825,,10.1007/s00701-010-0940-y,"PURPOSE: The growth pattern of craniopharyngiomas (CP) is yet to be understood due to challenges arising from the diversity of morphological features that exist. This in turn has had implications on the development of safe surgical strategies for management of these lesions. The aim of this study is to propose a morphological classification of CP based on their tumor-membrane relationship. It is hoped that this will contribute to better understanding of CP morphology and prediction of the intraoperative classification. METHODS: Histological techniques were used to study eight fetuses. Following Masson staining, the membranes around the pituitary stalk were observed under microscope. Pre-operative MRI and intraoperative images of 195 patients with CP were also analyzed. FINDINGS: The arachnoidal sleeve around the pituitary stalk (ASPS) was noted to be comprised of a compact fibrous component and a related loose trabecular component. The pituitary stalk was divided into four segments in accordance with the folds of the ASPS. Correspondingly, the growth of CPs was divided into four basic patterns-infra-diaphragmatic (ID), extra-arachnoidal (EA), intra-arachnoidal (IA) and sub-arachnoidal (SA) growth. The IA growth pattern can be further subdivided into two subtypes-namely, IA1 (with tumor growing within the fibrous component of the ASPS) and IA2 (with tumor growing within the trabecular component). This method of topographical division can be used to understand the growth of CP-infra-diaphragmatic CP show growth pattern ID or ID together with EA. Suprasellar CP can show an extra-ventricular growth pattern (EA or IA2), an extra- and intra-ventricular (IA2 + SA) growth pattern, a trans-infundibular growth pattern (ID + IA1 + SA) and an infundibulo-tuberal growth pattern (SA or SA + IA1). There is a statistically significant difference between CP growth patterns in children and adults. A predominance of ID growth is noted in children while adults tend to show a pattern of predominantly Extra-ventricular (EV) growth. CONCLUSION: Our proposed classification details the relationship of the surrounding structures to CPs and purports to predict and identify the intraoperative anatomical stratification. It also attempts to help predict the growth patterns of these tumors. A knowledge of the intimate relations of the tumor and its key surrounding structures allows for safe surgical removal."

This study aims to provide some evidence to clarify the growth pattern of intraventricular craniopharyngiomas (IVC), and to summarize the surgical strategy and outcome. METHODS: Seventeen cases of IVC were reviewed retrospectively in relation to preoperative imaging, clinical presentation, intraoperative findings, tumor pathology, and surgical outcome. The tumor-3rd VF relationship and the tumor's stratification were analyzed based on intraoperative inspection and histology. FINDINGS: Variable adherence patterns of IVC to the 3rd VF were found, which were classified as (a) purely IVC with pedicle attachment to 3rd VF (two cases), (b) intra-3rd VF tumors with wide-based attachment but a dissectible tumor boundary (seven cases), and (c) intra-3rd VF tumors with an undissectible wide, tight attachment (eight cases). Histological analysis revealed that both of the two cases with growth pattern ""a"" intruded into the third ventricular cavity without a covering layer of neural tissue (which only exists in the squamous-papillary subtype). Tumors with growth pattern ""b"" and ""c,"" in contrast, were noted to have a thin layer of neural tissue. This occurred in both subtypes (11 adamantinomatous, 4 papillary). Total removal was accomplished in all tumors demonstrating growth pattern ""a"" and ""b."" There was also better preservation of the 3rd VF and consequently a better outcome. On the other hand, total removal was only achieved in 50% of tumors showing growth pattern ""c"" including one mortality. No recurrence has been encountered in patients whose tumors were totally removed. CONCLUSION: Variable adherence patterns and tumor subtypes were observed in IVCs, which were correlated to the tumor pathology, resectability, and subsequent prognosis."

The morphological characteristics were analyzed by histopathological bronchial reconstruction. BO was classified into two major morphologic subtypes: constrictive BO (CoB) and cellular/destructive BO (CDB). CoB is characterized by concentric narrowing of the airway lumen due to submucosal fibrosis. In contrast, in CDB the narrowing of the airway lumen is due to intraluminal, mural, and peribronchiolar infiltration of inflammatory cells as well as proliferation of granulation tissue. The histopathological diagnosis was CoB in 6 patients and CDB in 3 patients. Macroscopic bronchial reconstruction in CoB demonstrated that the beginnings of bronchial obliterations were in the 4th to 7th branches, numbering from each segmental bronchus and the lesions were distributed intermittently. Histopathologically, the localization of obliteration was mainly from small bronchi to membranous bronchioli with intermittent airway luminal obliteration in CoB, whereas the primary lesions in CDB revealed more continuous obliteration of the bronchiolar lumen than observed in CoB. In conclusion, this bronchial reconstruction study demonstrated marked morphological differences in the mechanisms of airway obliteration between two major morphologic subtypes of BO."

Epub 2011 Mar 18.,Heneweer C,J Nucl Med,2011,2011/03/23,PMC3902086,NIHMS508522,10.2967/jnumed.110.083998,"Targeted nanoparticle-based technologies show increasing prevalence in radiotracer design. As a consequence, quantitative contribution of nonspecific accumulation in the target tissue, mainly governed by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, becomes highly relevant for evaluating the specificity of these new agents. This study investigated the influence of different tumor phenotypes on the EPR effect, hypothesizing that a baseline level of uptake must be exceeded to visualize high and specific uptake of a targeted macromolecular radiotracer. METHODS: These preliminary studies use (89)Zr-labeled mouse serum albumin ((89)Zr-desferrioxamine-mAlb) as a model radiotracer to assess uptake and retention in 3 xenograft models of human prostate cancer (CWR22rv1, DU-145, and PC-3). Experiments include PET and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging to assess morphology, vascularization, and radiotracer uptake; temporal ex vivo biodistribution studies to quantify radiotracer uptake over time; and histologic and autoradiographic studies to evaluate the intra- and intertumoral distribution of (89)Zr-desferrioxamine-mAlb. RESULTS: Early uptake profiles show statistically significant but overall small differences in radiotracer uptake between different tumor phenotypes. By 20 h, nonspecific radiotracer uptake was found to be independent of tumor size and phenotype, reaching at least 5.0 percentage injected dose per gram in all 3 tumor models. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that minimal differences in tumor uptake exist at early time points, dependent on the tumor type. However, these differences equalize over time, reaching around 5.0 percentage injected dose per gram at 20 h after injection. These data provide strong support for the introduction of mandatory experimental controls of future macromolecular or nanoparticle-based drugs, particularly regarding the development of targeted radiotracers."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty disk-shaped samples (10 x 2 mm) with 3 different surface topographies (Dental Tech, Misinto, Italy) were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy: group A, machined surface; group B, titanium plasma-spray surface; group C, acid-etched and sandblasted surface (Blasted Wrinkled Surface). RESULTS: The amplitude roughness parameter (Sa) of the machined surfaces was 0.6 mum, while the developed surface area ratio (Sdr) was 14%; for the titanium plasma-spray surfaces, the values were, respectively, 5.3 mum and 97%, and for the Blasted Wrinkled Surfaces, 1.5 mum and 63%. Images at 1.000, 20.000, and 50.000 magnifications were processed for quantitative analysis of Df using the box-counting method. At 1.000x, Df for group A, B, and C was 1.86, 1.80, and 1.81, respectively; at 20.000x, Df for group A, B, and C was 1.85, 1.71, 1.58, respectively; and at 50.000x, Df was 1.83, 1.61, and 1.51 for A, B, and C groups. Statistically significant differences were found for Df values. CONCLUSIONS: Df provides not only an index of roughness size values but also a measure of roughness spatial organization; therefore, it could be a promising method to differentiate between rough surfaces capable of supporting osseointegration."

Cap rupture occurs when the peak cap stress exceeds the cap strength. The mechanical stress within a cap depends on the plaque morphology and the material characteristics of the plaque components. A parametric study was conducted to assess the effect of intima stiffness and plaque morphology on peak cap stress. METHODS: Models with idealized geometries based on histology images of human coronary arteries were generated by varying geometric plaque features. The constructed multi-layer models contained adventitia, media, intima, and necrotic core sections. For adventitia and media layers, anisotropic hyperelastic material models were used. For necrotic core and intima sections, isotropic hyperelastic material models were employed. Three different intima stiffness values were used to cover the wide range reported in literature. According to the intima stiffness, the models were classified as stiff, intermediate and soft intima models. Finite element method was used to compute peak cap stress. RESULTS: The intima stiffness was an essential determinant of cap stresses. The computed peak cap stresses for the soft intima models were much lower than for stiff and intermediate intima models. Intima stiffness also affected the influence of morphological parameters on cap stresses. For the stiff and intermediate intima models, the cap thickness and necrotic core thickness were the most important determinants of cap stresses. The peak cap stress increased three-fold when the cap thickness was reduced from 0.25 mm to 0.05 mm for both stiff and intermediate intima models. Doubling the thickness of the necrotic core elevated the peak cap stress by 60% for the stiff intima models and by 90% for the intermediate intima models. Two-fold increase in the intima thickness behind the necrotic core reduced the peak cap stress by approximately 25% for both intima models. For the soft intima models, cap thickness was less critical and changed the peak cap stress by 55%. However, the necrotic core thickness was more influential and changed the peak cap stress by 100%. The necrotic core angle emerged as a critical determinant of cap stresses where a larger angle lowered the cap stresses. Contrary to the stiff and intermediate intima models, a thicker intima behind the necrotic core increased the peak cap stress by approximately 25% for the soft intima models. Adventitia thickness and local media regression had limited effects for all three intima models. CONCLUSIONS: For the stiff and intermediate intima models, the cap thickness was the most important morphological risk factor. However for soft intima models, the necrotic core thickness and necrotic core angle had a bigger impact on the peak cap stress. We therefore need to enhance our knowledge of intima material properties if we want to derive critical morphological plaque features for risk evaluation."

However, high-resolution characterization of their morphology has not been addressed by conventional microscopy. Under the help of high-resolution hopping probe ion conductance microscopy, we demonstrated that three morphologically distinct cell populations exist in live NB SK-N-SH cell line. Among these three types cells, N-type cells had the smallest cell volume and the biggest height, S-type owned the biggest cell volume and the smallest height, and I-type was intermediate between N- and S-type. The difference of microvilli morphology rendered I- and N-type cells with a higher RMS than S-type cells. These high-resolution morphologic criteria can provide more direct information to distinguish different cell types in NB tumor, and may give a hand to the development of new therapies and diagnosis."

This is frequently accomplished by fluorescence microscopy with well-characterized markers and posterior evaluation of the signal colocalization. Rigorous study of colocalization requires statistical analysis of the data, albeit yet no single technique has been established as a standard method. Indeed, the few methods currently available are only accurate in images with particular characteristics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm to automatically obtain the true colocalization between images that is suitable for a wide variety of biological situations. To proceed, the algorithm contemplates the individual contribution of each pixel's fluorescence intensity in a pair of images to the overall Pearsons correlation and Manders' overlap coefficients. The accuracy and reliability of the algorithm was validated on both simulated and real images that reflected the characteristics of a range of biological samples. We used this algorithm in combination with image restoration by deconvolution and time-lapse confocal microscopy to address the localization of MEK1 in the mitochondria of different cell lines. Appraising the previously described behavior of Akt1 corroborated the reliability of the combined use of these techniques. Together, the present work provides a novel statistical approach to accurately and reliably determine the colocalization in a variety of biological images."

Although the previous scrubbing technique and stripping method can provide sufficient information about human corneocytes, they are either subject to artifacts or involve time-consuming data processing. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the first stage, an adhesive tape is used to collect corneocytes as in the regular stripping method. Then, a D-squame skin indicator is used to divide the collected corneocytes into a lesser populated sample, in which more individual corneocytes can be observed with the help of fluorescent microscopy after dye staining. The method was applied to study the change of corneocytes after moisturizer (glycerin) treatment. RESULTS: The modified stripping method described allows the automated processing of the geometrical characteristics of corneocytes. Data for several hundreds of corneocytes can easily be collected. The analysis of glycerin treatment demonstrated a high sensitivity for the method. An average increase of the corneocyte area of 5.1% was found after 9 days of treatment (the accuracy of the method was 0.5%). CONCLUSION: The method described is suitable for the automated data processing. It allows for the reliable detection of the expansion of the average area of corneocytes after 9 days of daily glycerin treatment."

The limited field of view of high-resolution microscopes requires the merging of multiple images that are taken sequentially to cover a large area. This merging or mosaicing of images requires long acquisition and processing times, and produces artifacts. To reduce both time and artifacts, we developed a mosaicing method on a confocal microscope that images morphology in large areas of excised tissue with sub-cellular detail. By acquiring image strips with aspect ratios of 10:1 and higher (instead of the standard ~1:1) and ""stitching"" them in software, our method images 10 x 10 mm(2) area of tissue in about 3 min. This method, which we call ""strip mosaicing,"" is currently three times as fast as our previous method."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following risk factors were statistically analyzed: age and menopausal status, parity using hormonal replacement therapy (HRT), BMI, 2D USG of the endometrium (thickness, uterine artery blood flow indices) and 3D USG (volume, vascularization indices) in relation to the result of histopathological examination of the endometrial tissue in 421 women, aged 22-87 years, with abnormal bleeding from the uterus. The changes of the sensitivity and specificity in the applied models corresponding to changes of the limit value, were presented in the form of receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and the comparison of the values of the area under the curve (AUC). The threshold value for the obtained models was established and models of artificial neuron networks (ANN) were constructed on the basis of the ROC. CONCLUSION: Application of artificial neural networks in medicine has been developing rapidly They have been applied in pre-surgical differentiation of ovarian tumors and other neoplasms. In case of endometrial carcinoma the degree of clinical usage of artificial neural networks has been limited, despite the fact that, from the mathematical point of view, the differentiation using neural networks would be much more precise than the one that could be obtained by chance."

Epub 2010 Oct 28.,Joshua AM,Prostate,2011,2010/10/30,,,10.1002/pros.21294,"BACKGROUND: Many critical events in prostatic carcinogenesis appear to relate to the emergence of genomic instability. Characteristic genomic abnormalities such as 8p loss, 8q gain, trisomy 7, and PTEN microdeletions may provide selective advantages to increase neoplastic transformation. Evidence suggests that telomere dysfunction is a plausible mechanism for some of these abnormalities on the basis of the break-fusion-bridge cycle that can lead to manifestations of genomic instability. METHODS: In this study, we correlate telomere length measured by quantitative FISH in various prostatic histologies with markers of genomic instability and immunohistochemical measures of proliferation and oxidative stress. RESULTS: We find that telomere shortening is correlated with abnormalities on chromosome 8, but not with trisomy 7 or abnormalities of the PTEN locus. There are associations with C-MYC aberrations in stroma with greater proximity to cancer and a correlation between telomere length in a number of prostatic histologies and the adjacent stroma, suggesting the importance of microenvironmental effects on telomere maintenance in the prostate. This finding was also supported by the finding of the correlation between telomere attrition and the levels of oxidative stress as measured by malondialdehyde staining in HPIN lesions close to cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Telomere attrition in the prostate gland is associated with particular genomic aberrations that contribute to the genomic instability characteristic of prostatic carcinogenesis. Correlations between various histologies and adjacent stroma telomere length suggest it is also may reveal microenvironmental effects within the prostate gland. Oxidative stress may contribute to telomere attrition in HPIN close to cancer."

The three most classical image focus measurements: the sum-modified-Laplacian, the tenengrad and the variance, which aim at estimating the degree of focus of an acquired image by emphasizing and quantifying its sharpness information, are considered and reinterpreted using the LIP framework. These reinterpretations notably make attempts at evaluating degrees of focus in terms of human brightness (sensation) from physical light stimuli. Their potential is illustrated and validated on shape-from-focus issues on both simulated data and real acquisitions in digital optical microscopy. The concept of shape-from-focus involves recovering the shape of an observed thick sample by locally maximizing a focus measurement throughout a sequence of differently focused images. Finally, it is shown that the LIP-based focus measurements clearly outperform their respective classical ones."

Epub 2010 Dec 7.,He H,Cancer Epidemiol,2011,2010/12/15,,,10.1016/j.canep.2010.09.006,"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationship between SLC22A18 expression and clinicopathologic features while investigate the prognostic value of SLC22A18 expression in breast cancer after surgery. SPECIMENS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to examine SLC22A18 protein expression in the breast tumors. Prognostic value of SLC22A18 protein and other clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to predict factors with a significant independent prognostic value. Digital image analysis was employed to quantify immunostaining. RESULTS: SLC22A18 expression was correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and extensive lyphovascular invasion. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that SLC22A18 expression was associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) of breast cancer. The survival of higher expression SLC22A18 group had longer cum survival compared to the group with low expression. The difference was significant (p=0.003, log-rank test). Cox's regression analysis showed that tumor size, lymph nodes metastasis, nuclear stage, extensive lymphovascular invasion, and SLC22A18 expression might be used as prognostic factor for RFS. Nuclear stage and SLC22A18 expression were the most meaningful histopathologic parameter in predicting tumor recurrence. Compared with the group of higher SLC22A18 expression, the lower expression group was more likely to relapse. The HR is 2.624 (p=0.035). CONCLUSION: Low expression of SLC22A18 was associated with tumor progression, recurrence and poor survival after breast surgery. Testing expression of SLC22A18 will be helpful for predicting prognosis in breast cancer."

However, the relationship between findings on NBI magnification and the microvessel architecture of colorectal lesions remains to be clarified. AIMS: The aim of this study was to clarify the correlation between NBI findings and the microvascular architecture of colorectal lesions according to the depth of microvessels from the mucosal surface. METHODS: A total of 22 colorectal lesions (11 tubular adenomas and 11 hyperplasia) obtained from 22 patients were studied. These lesions were analyzed microscopically on tissue specimens immunostained with CD34. Three-dimensional images were reconstructed from serial sections of tubular adenomas, hyperplasia, and normal mucosa. RESULTS: Three-dimensional reconstructed images of tubular adenoma and normal mucosa to a depth of less than 150 mum from the mucosal surface showed similar structures to images obtained by NBI magnification. Microvessel diameter was significantly larger in tubular adenoma than in normal mucosa (P = 0.002) and hyperplasia (P = 0.034), and microvessel area was significantly larger in tubular adenoma than in normal mucosa (P < 0.001) and hyperplasia (P < 0.001) only in the superficial mucosal layer (to a depth of less than 150 mum). CONCLUSIONS: TA was characterized by thicker microvessels and higher volume of microvessels than NM and HP. Compared with white light, NBI can more accurately depict the characteristics of microvessels because it uses light with short wavelengths, thereby contributing to high diagnostic capability."

Epub 2011 Jan 28.,Dewan MA,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,2011,2011/02/01,,,10.1109/TBME.2011.2109001,"This paper presents a vision-based method for automatic tracking of biological cells in time-lapse microscopy by combining the motion features with the topological features of the cells. The automation of tracking frequently faces problems of segmentation error and of finding correct cell correspondence in consecutive frames, since the cells are of varying size and shape, and may have uneven movement; these problems become more acute when the cell population is very high. To reduce the segmentation error, we introduce a cell-detection method based on h-maxima transformation, followed by the fitting of an ellipse for the nucleus shape. To find the correct correspondence between the detected cells, the topological features, namely, color compatibility, area overlap and deformation are combined with the motion features of skewness and displacement. This reduces the ambiguity of matching and constructs accurately the trajectories of the cell proliferation. Finally, a template-matching-based backward tracking procedure is employed to recover any break in a cell trajectory that may occur due to the segmentation errors or the presence of a mitosis. The tracking procedure is tested using a number of different cell sequences with nonuniform illumination, or uneven cell motion, and is shown to provide high accuracy both in the detection and the tracking of the cells."

Advances in optical imaging enabled production of a handheld intraoperative confocal microscope. OBJECTIVE: To present a feasibility analysis of the intraoperative confocal microscope for brain tumor resection. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with brain tumor treated at Barrow Neurological Institute were examined. All patients received an intravenous bolus of sodium fluorescein before confocal imaging with the Optiscan FIVE 1 system probe. Optical biopsies were obtained within each tumor and along the tumor-brain interfaces. Corresponding pathologic specimens were then excised and processed. These data was compared by a neuropathologist to identify the concordance for tumor histology, grade, and margins. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 33 lesions were tumors (93.9%) and 2 cases were identified as radiation necrosis (6.1%). Of the former, 25 (80.6%) were intra-axial and 6 (19.4%) were extra-axial. Intra-axial tumors were most commonly gliomas and metastases, while all extra-axial tumors were meningiomas. Among high-grade gliomas, vascular neoproliferation, as well as tumor margins, were identifiable using confocal imaging. Meningothelial and fibrous meningiomas were distinct on confocal microscopy--the latter featured spindle-shaped cells distinguishable from adjacent parenchyma. Other tumor histologies correlated well with standard neuropathology tissue preparations. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative confocal microscopy is a practicable technology for the resection of human brain tumors. Preliminary analysis demonstrates reliability for a variety of lesions in identifying tumor cells and the tumor-brain interface. Further refinement of this technology depends upon the approval of tumor-specific fluorescent contrast agents for human use."

Although the detailed pathophysiology of MIO has yet to be clarified, evidence increasingly suggests an osteoblastic defect as the underlying cause. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the expression profile of certain osteoblastic or osteoblast-related genes (ie, WNT10B, RUNX2, Osterix, Osteocalcin, SOST, RANKL, and OPG) is different in iliac crest biopsies of MIO patients when compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, we investigated the relation of local gene expression characteristics with histomorphometric, microstructural, and clinical features. Following written informed consent and diligent clinical patient characterization, iliac crest biopsies were performed in nine men. While RNA extraction, reverse-transcription, and real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed on one biopsy, a second biopsy of each patient was submitted for histomorphometry and micro-computed tomography (microCT). Age-matched bone samples from forensic autopsies served as controls. MIO patients displayed significantly reduced WNT10B, RUNX2, RANKL, and SOST expression. Performing microCT for the first time in MIO biopsies, we found significant decreases in trabecular number and connectivity density. Trabecular separation was increased significantly, but trabecular thickness was similar in both groups. Histomorphometry revealed decreased BV/TV and osteoid volume and fewer osteoclasts in MIO. By providing evidence for reduced local WNT10B, RUNX2, and RANKL gene expression and histomorphometric low turnover, our data support the osteoblast dysfunction model discussed for MIO. Further, MIO seems to lead to a different microstructural pathology than age-related bone loss."

Epub 2011 Apr 21.,Zhu X,Scanning,2011,2011/04/27,,,10.1002/sca.20230,"Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) was applied to examine the marginal region at dermis of keloid compared with atrophic scar. High-resolution large-area image showed an obvious boundary at the scar margin and different morphological patterns of elastin and collagen on the two sides, further visualized by the focused three-dimensional images. Content alteration of elastin or collagen between the two sides of boundary was quantified to show significant difference between keloid and atrophic scar. Owing to the raised property of keloid with overproduced collagen on the scar side, the content alteration was positive for elastin and negative for collagen. On the contrary, the content alteration was negative for elastin and positive for collagen in the atrophic scar case due to the atrophic collagen on the scar side. It indicated that examination of the scar margin by MPM may lead a new way to discriminate different types of scars and better understand the scarring mechanisms."

Epub 2011 May 9.,Davenport MS,Radiology,2011,2011/05/11,,,10.1148/radiol.11102476,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine the optimal Hounsfield unit threshold and region of interest (ROI) size required to accurately diagnose renal angiomyolipoma (AML) and differentiate it from renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant, and the requirement for written informed patient consent was waived. The radiologic reports on 4502 dual-phase abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations (nonenhanced and nephrographic phases, 5-mm collimation, 120-140 kVp, variable milliampere-second settings) performed in 2872 patients from June 2002 through October 2007 were reviewed. Solid-component masses reported as suspicious for RCC or AML were correlated with histologic and/or follow-up imaging findings. ROIs of three different sizes-tiny (8-13 mm(2)), small (19-24 mm(2)), and medium (30-35 mm(2))-were drawn in the lowest-attenuation focus on images obtained during both phases. The test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false-positive rate, false-negative rate) of multiple attenuation thresholds at each combination of ROI size and contrast enhancement phase were calculated, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were derived. Areas under the ROC curve were calculated. RESULTS: There were 217 RCCs and 65 AMLs. With an attenuation threshold of -10 HU or lower at nonenhanced CT, RCC would be misdiagnosed as AML in 11 (5.1%) cases, one (0.5%) case, and one (0.5%) case with use of the tiny, small, and medium ROIs, respectively. With use of the tiny, small, and medium ROIs, misdiagnosis rates would be 2.3%, 0.5%, and 0.5%, respectively, at a threshold of -15 HU or lower and 1.8%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, at a threshold of -20 HU or lower. Areas under the ROC curve for the nonenhanced phase images (range, 0.874-0.889) were superior to those for the nephrographic phase images (range, 0.790-0.826). CONCLUSION: Nonenhanced CT images were superior to nephrographic phase CT images for the diagnosis of AML. An attenuation threshold of -10 HU or lower with an ROI of at least 19-24 mm(2) is optimal for the diagnosis of AML. This threshold is not accurate with use of smaller (8-13-mm(2)) ROIs."

Epub 2011 May 19.,Rajan N,J Pathol,2011,2011/05/21,,,10.1002/path.2896,"Patients carrying heterozygous germline truncating mutations in the CYLD gene develop multiple primary hair follicle-related tumours. A highly patterned tumour, termed cylindroma, and a highly disorganized tumour, termed spiradenoma, may both develop in the same patient. Furthermore, histological features of both tumour types have been described within the same tumour specimen. We used three-dimensional computer-aided reconstruction of these tumours to demonstrate contiguous growth of cylindromas into spiradenomas, thus suggesting a transition between the two tumour types. To explore factors that may influence cutaneous tumour patterning, genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of 32 CYLD-defective tumours was performed. Overexpression of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway was observed relative to normal perilesional tissue. Morphometric analysis was used to investigate the relationship between Wnt pathway-related gene expression and tumour organization. This revealed an association between reduced Dickkopf 2 (DKK2-a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway) expression and loss of tumour patterning. Reduced DKK2 expression was associated with methylation of the DKK2 gene promoter in the majority of tumour samples assayed. RNA interference-mediated silencing of DKK2 expression in cylindroma primary cell cultures caused an increase in colony formation, cell viability, and anchorage-independent growth. Using these data, we propose a model where epigenetic programming may influence tumour patterning in patients with CYLD mutations."

ImageMiner is a federated system of services that provides a reliable set of analytical and data management capabilities for investigative research applications in pathology. It provides a library of image processing methods, including automated registration, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification, all of which have been tailored, in these studies, to support TMA analysis. The system is designed to leverage high-performance computing machines so that investigators can rapidly analyze large ensembles of imaged TMA specimens. To support deployment in collaborative, multi-institutional projects, ImageMiner features grid-enabled, service-based components so that multiple instances of ImageMiner can be accessed remotely and federated. RESULTS: The experimental evaluation shows that: (1) ImageMiner is able to support reliable detection and feature extraction of tumor regions within imaged tissues; (2) images and analysis results managed in ImageMiner can be searched for and retrieved on the basis of image-based features, classification information, and any correlated clinical data, including any metadata that have been generated to describe the specified tissue and TMA; and (3) the system is able to reduce computation time of analyses by exploiting computing clusters, which facilitates analysis of larger sets of tissue samples."

DESIGN: Prospective research study. SETTING: Andrology laboratory of department of applied biology. PATIENT(S): Semen samples from human fertile donors, rabbit, bull, and ram. INTERVENTION(S): Semen analysis by optical microscopy and sperm motility evaluation with the use of CASA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Analysis of sperm tracks with a CASA system acquired at different frame rates (FRs) (12-200 Hz). RESULT(S): The FR had no effect on the motility rate or on the sperm track reconstruction, whereas all the other kinetic values were affected by sampling frequency. Sperm with low speed (category b) and/or linear trajectories (category a) are less affected by sampling frequency and do not require particularly high FR to be correctly evaluated. On the contrary, fast nonlinear sperm (category c) would require a very high frequency to fully describe the path. CONCLUSION(S): Because all the commercial CASA systems acquire at an FR of 30-60 Hz, an increase in FR is required to render the estimation results closer to the ""real path"" mainly for fast nonlinear sperm."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue specimens were multiplex-immunostained to reveal cell structures, cell type markers, and analytes, and imaged with multispectral microscopy. The image data were processed with novel software that automatically delineates and types each cell in the field, measures morphological features, and quantifies analytes in different subcellular compartments of specified cells.The methodology was validated with the use of cell blocks composed of differentially labelled cultured cells mixed in known proportions, and evaluated on human breast carcinoma specimens for quantifying human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Ki67, phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase, and phospho-S6. Automated cell-level analyses closely matched human assessments, but, predictably, differed from pixel-level analyses of the same images. CONCLUSIONS: Our method reveals the type, distribution, morphology and biomarker state of each cell in the field, and allows multiple biomarkers to be quantified over specified cell types, regardless of their abundance. It is ideal for studying specimens from patients in clinical trials of targeted therapeutic agents, for investigating minority stromal cell subpopulations, and for phenotypic characterization to personalize therapy and prognosis."

A controversy exists regarding the cause of the deformity, and therefore, there is a controversy of how to correct the deformity. Extrinsic theory is based on the presence of deformational forces from outside. The intrinsic theory is associated with deficiency of the lower lateral cartilage. The aim of this study was to use new objective tools to compare morphologically and histologically between the lower lateral cartilages of cleft and noncleft sides in patients with unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity. This study included 16 patients. They were operated on to correct unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity. Length, width, and thickness of lateral crura of the lower lateral cartilages of cleft and noncleft sides were measured. Punch biopsies from the middle part of the caudal ends of lateral crura were taken and sent for histologic and immunohistochemical studies. The lateral crura of the cleft side were significantly wider and shorter and tend to be thinner than those of the noncleft side. There was no significant difference in the chondroblast, chondrocyte, and total cellular number in the lower lateral cartilage of the cleft and noncleft sides. There was significantly less glycosaminoglycan content in the ground matrix of the lower lateral cartilage of cleft side. In conclusion, the use of digital sliding caliber in measuring the diminutions of the lower lateral cartilage and image analyzer to quantify the proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, fibroblast growth factor 18, and collagen content is very effective objective tools to compare the cleft and noncleft alar cartilage."

The identification of patient-specific tumor characteristics that can improve the ability to predict response to chemotherapy would help optimize advanced breast cancer treatment approaches. Quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) may be applied to the standardization of protein analysis, resulting in increased sensitivity and reproducibility. In the current pilot study, QIF was used to correlate the expression of beta tubulin III and thymidylate synthase with clinical outcome associated with taxane and capecitabine treatment, respectively. QIF analysis is based on fluorescent dye-labeled monoclonal antibody staining followed by computer-assisted microscopy to measure the expression of molecular markers in tumor samples derived from a retrospective database. The interpretation of the tumor marker expression levels results in classification of breast tumors as sensitive or resistant to a mechanistically related drug. Overall diagnostic accuracy of QIF for taxane based therapy was 88% (CI 75.0 - 95.3) with a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 100%, while diagnostic accuracy QIF for capecitabine therapy was 86% (CI 88.0-96.0) with a positive predictive value of 80% and a negative predictive value of 100%. In this study, QIF showed retrospectively a potential for predictive value when analyzing chemotherapeutic treatments for individual advanced stage breast cancer patients. The predictive power of the QIF for chemotherapy confirms that further studies utilizing larger clinical cohorts are warranted."

In contrast to microarrays, which provide data for many genes but averaged and/or at low resolution, images reveal the high spatial dynamics of gene expression. Developing computational methods to compare, annotate, and model gene expression based on images is imperative, considering that available data are rapidly increasing. We have developed a sparse Bayesian factor analysis model in which the observed expression diversity of among a large set of high-dimensional images is modeled by a small number of hidden common factors. We apply this approach on embryonic expression patterns from a Drosophila RNA in situ image database, and show that the automatically inferred factors provide for a meaningful decomposition and represent common co-regulation or biological functions. The low-dimensional set of factor mixing weights is further used as features by a classifier to annotate expression patterns with functional categories. On human-curated annotations, our sparse approach reaches similar or better classification of expression patterns at different developmental stages, when compared to other automatic image annotation methods using thousands of hard-to-interpret features. Our study therefore outlines a general framework for large microscopy data sets, in which both the generative model itself, as well as its application for analysis tasks such as automated annotation, can provide insight into biological questions."

Ten extensive bone defects in the anterior and posterior maxilla or mandible involving crestal bone were treated by grafted blocks and chips of autogenous calvarial bone. The grafts were fixed with lag screws and left to heal for 4 months. No complications were observed. At surgical reentry for implant placement, a cylindric bone biopsy of both graft and native bone was retrieved and analyzed with both micro-CT and standard histology. Two- and three-dimensional (2D, 3D) micro-CT analyses allowed bone connectivity indices to be evaluated. This is useful for estimating bone strength and observing bone structure. The integration of the grafted calvarial bone with the residual bone of the recipient site was considered satisfactory. Histologic analysis allowed observations to be made at a higher resolution. Calvarial bone grafts seem to have positive effects when used as grafting materials. The application of both histologic and micro-CT techniques allows a better evaluation of grafted bone by concurrently allowing 2D and 3D visual and morphometric analysis of bone vitality, structure, turnover, and strength."

The colored staining methods used to identify different tissue components reveal various patterns that contribute in different ways to the digital texture of the image. A histological digital image can be represented with various color spaces. The approximation processes of pixel values that are carried out while converting between different color spaces can affect image texture and subsequently could influence the performance of TA. Conventional TA is carried out on grey scale images, which are a luminance approximation to the original RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) space. Currently, grey scale is considered sufficient for characterization of fibrosis but this may not be the case for sophisticated assessment of fibrosis or when resolution conditions vary. This paper investigates the accuracy of TA results on three color spaces, conventional grey scale, RGB, and Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI), at different resolutions. The results demonstrate that RGB is the most accurate in texture classification of liver images, producing better results, most notably at low resolution. Furthermore, the green channel, which is dominated by collagen fiber deposition, appears to provide most of the features for characterizing fibrosis images. The HSI space demonstrated a high percentage error for the majority of texture methods at all resolutions, suggesting that this space is insufficient for fibrosis characterization.

Epub 2011 Mar 23.,Muthu Rama Krishnan M,Micron,2011,2011/04/16,,,10.1016/j.micron.2011.03.003,"The objective of this paper is to provide a texture based segmentation algorithm for better delineation of the epithelial layer from histological images in discriminating normal and oral sub-mucous fibrosis (OSF). As per literature and oral clinicians, it is established that the OSF initially originates and propagates in the epithelial layer. So, more accurate segmentation of this layer is extremely important for a clinician to make a diagnostic decision. In doing this, Gabor based texture gradient is computed in gray scale images, followed by preprocessing of the microscopic images of oral histological sections. On the other hand, the color gradients of these images are obtained in the transformed Lab color space. Finally, the watershed segmentation is extended to segment the layer based on the combination of texture and color gradients. The segmented images are compared with the ground truth images provided by the oral experts. The segmentation results depict the superiority of the texture based segmentation in comparison to the Otsu's based segmentation in terms of misclassification error. Results are shown and discussed."

In the current study, histomorphological analyses of diabetic and non-diabetic plantar tissue were performed. It was hypothesized that the diabetic tissue would have thicker skin (epidermis and dermis), less interdigitation between the dermis and epidermis, thicker elastic septa and decreased adipose cell size. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two locations of the foot (the heel and the first metatarsal) were examined, both of which have been reported to be locations with a high incidence of ulceration. Stereological methods and quantitative morphological techniques were used to evaluate the skin thickness, interdigitation index, elastic septae thickness and adipocyte cell size. RESULTS: The diabetic donors had a greater body mass index (BMI) than the non-diabetic donors. The diabetic tissue had significantly thicker elastic septae and dermis. However, no significant difference was observed in the interdigitation index or adipocyte size. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that morphological changes can be evaluated histologically to give a better understanding of the pathological changes in the plantar soft tissue with diabetes. These evaluations can then be associated with biomechanical changes that occur in diabetes to provide new insight into how microstructural changes can alter macroscopic properties. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An understanding of the histomorphological changes in the soft tissue in relationship to the location on the foot could help to explain the biomechanical changes that occur in diabetes and the subsequent increase in susceptibility to breakdown."

Epub 2011 Jun 13.,Shibuya K,Brain Res,2011,2011/07/05,,,10.1016/j.brainres.2011.06.014,"Astrocytic plaques (APs) and tuft-shaped astrocytes (TAs) are frequently found in the brains of patients with corticobasal degeneration or progressive supranuclear palsy and are considered histopathological markers of these clinicopathological entities. Possible involvement of blood vessels in these lesions, occasionally found in routine histological examination, was estimated by observing thick sections (50-100 mum). The relative distance between the center of each AP/TA to the nearest blood vessel was lesser than that between the nearest blood vessel and control random reference points, and this finding confirmed that APs/TAs are formed in close proximity to blood vessels. Furthermore, three-dimensional reconstruction of sections double-immunolabeled for phosphorylated tau (AT8) and blood vessels (von Willebrand factor) showed the smaller diameter of TAs (mean+/-SD, 31.3+/-5.2 mum; n=15) and closer contact of their AT8-positive processes to blood vessels, representing proximal accumulation of phosphorylated tau in TAs. This is in contrast with larger APs (88.5+/-15.2mum, n=63), in which AT8-positive processes rarely have vascular contact. Even though the endfeet of astrocytes come into close contact with blood vessels, tau deposition, observed in both TAs and APs, was always oriented around the blood vessel, implying that these apparently distinct lesions (APs/TAs) share a common mechanism for tau deposition that is oriented around the blood vessel."

However, manual processing of these images is not practical and is infeasible for larger and larger scale studies. Reliable interpretation and analysis of high volume data requires accurate quantitative measures. This requires analysis algorithms to use mathematical models that inherit the underlying geometry of biological structures in order to extract topological information. In this paper, we first introduce principal curves as a model for the underlying skeleton of axons and branches, then describe a recursive principal curve tracing (RPCT) method to extract this topology information from 3D microscopy imagery. RPCT first finds samples on the one dimensional principal set of the intensity function in space. Then, given an initial direction and location, the algorithm iteratively traces the principal curve in space using our principal curve tracing (PCT) method. Recursive implementation of PCT provides a compact solution for extracting complex tubular structures that exhibit bifurcations."

Epub 2011 Apr 11.,Kong H,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2011,2011/04/14,PMC3165069,NIHMS299955,10.1109/TMI.2011.2141674,"For quantitative analysis of histopathological images, such as the lymphoma grading systems, quantification of features is usually carried out on single cells before categorizing them by classification algorithms. To this end, we propose an integrated framework consisting of a novel supervised cell-image segmentation algorithm and a new touching-cell splitting method. For the segmentation part, we segment the cell regions from the other areas by classifying the image pixels into either cell or extra-cellular category. Instead of using pixel color intensities, the color-texture extracted at the local neighborhood of each pixel is utilized as the input to our classification algorithm. The color-texture at each pixel is extracted by local Fourier transform (LFT) from a new color space, the most discriminant color space (MDC). The MDC color space is optimized to be a linear combination of the original RGB color space so that the extracted LFT texture features in the MDC color space can achieve most discrimination in terms of classification (segmentation) performance. To speed up the texture feature extraction process, we develop an efficient LFT extraction algorithm based on image shifting and image integral. For the splitting part, given a connected component of the segmentation map, we initially differentiate whether it is a touching-cell clump or a single nontouching cell. The differentiation is mainly based on the distance between the most likely radial-symmetry center and the geometrical center of the connected component. The boundaries of touching-cell clumps are smoothed out by Fourier shape descriptor before carrying out an iterative, concave-point and radial-symmetry based splitting algorithm. To test the validity, effectiveness and efficiency of the framework, it is applied to follicular lymphoma pathological images, which exhibit complex background and extracellular texture with nonuniform illumination condition. For comparison purposes, the results of the proposed segmentation algorithm are evaluated against the outputs of superpixel, graph-cut, mean-shift, and two state-of-the-art pathological image segmentation methods using ground-truth that was established by manual segmentation of cells in the original images. Our segmentation algorithm achieves better results than the other compared methods. The results of splitting are evaluated in terms of under-splitting, over-splitting, and encroachment errors. By summing up the three types of errors, we achieve a total error rate of 5.25% per image."

In this report we show that some of the previously reported experimental results using automatic microscopy image analysis might be biased, and discuss practices and methods that can be used to obtain objective and reliable automatic analysis of microscopy images."

DESIGN: Prospective, observational case series. METHODS: Fourteen corneal buttons from 14 keratoconic patients (9 males and 5 females; mean age, 34.3 years) who had undergone keratoplasty for advanced keratoconus and 6 corneal buttons from 6 normal corneas were included. Whole mounts were stained for acetylcholinesterase and were scanned with a novel digital pathology scanning microscope. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of keratoconic corneas demonstrated central stromal nerve changes, which included thickening, tortuosity, nerve spouting, and overgrowth. The nerve changes ranged from early to extensive and could be separated into 3 different grades. The central stromal nerves were abnormally thicker (18.9 +/- 14.7 mum) than in controls (8.11 +/- 3.31 mum; P < .001). The thickness of peripheral stromal nerves (12.6 +/- 3.1 mum) was similar to that of controls (14.86 +/- 5.60 mum; P = .072). Subbasal nerves showed changes in the form of loss of radial orientation and increased tortuosity, especially at the cone apex. At the cone base, a concentric arrangement of subbasal nerves was found in 43% of cases. Localized thickenings of subbasal nerves also were observed at their origin from the bulbous terminations of sub-Bowman nerves. The terminal bulbs, too, were enlarged. The mean diameter of the subbasal nerves in keratoconus (4.11 +/- 0.60 mum) did not differ from that of the controls (4.0 +/- 0.61 mum; P = .422). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides additional histologic evidence of the involvement of corneal nerves in keratoconus and suggests further that they may play a role in the pathophysiologic factors and progression of the disease."

The aim of this study was attempt to find out the site of origin and the common expansion routes of JNA. METHODS: The CT examinations of 46 untreated patients with histologically proven JNA were retrospectively analyzed. Evidence of tumor spreading of the locations are those following CT characteristics: (a) expansion and/or erosion of bony wall; (b) obliteration of normal fatty planes. In addition, three dimensional reconstruction technology was used to make further study. RESULTS: The pterygoid canal was affected in all untreated cases and therefore was considered as the origin of JNA. Nineteen patients' tumors (41.3%) originated from the front part of pterygoid canal and the other 27 ones (58.7%) from the post part of pterygoid canal. Pterygoid canal, choanae and nasal cavity are the three most common sites of JNA. CONCLUSION: The possible site of origin is pterygoid canal. After originating from this point, the tumor will invade sphenopalatine foramen, sphenoid sinus and pterygopalatine fossa first, and then into adjacent structure through aforementioned three sites."

Possessing many attractive characteristics such as the use of nonionizing electromagnetic waves, good resolution and contrast, portable instrumention, and the ability to partially quantitate the signal, photoacoustic techniques have been applied to the imaging of cancer, wound healing, disorders in the brain, and gene expression, among others. As a promising structural, functional, and molecular imaging modality for a wide range of biomedical applications, photoacoustic imaging can be categorized into two types of systems: photoacoustic tomography (PAT), which is the focus of this article, and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). We first briefly describe the endogenous (e.g., hemoglobin and melanin) and the exogenous (e.g., indocyanine green [ICG], various gold nanoparticles, single-walled carbon nanotubes [SWNTs], quantum dots [QDs], and fluorescent proteins) contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging. Next, we discuss in detail the applications of nontargeted photoacoustic imaging. Recently, molecular photoacoustic (MPA) imaging has gained significant interest, and a few proof-of-principle studies have been reported. We summarize the current state of the art of MPA imaging, including the imaging of gene expression and the combination of photoacoustic imaging with other imaging modalities. Last, we point out obstacles facing photoacoustic imaging. Although photoacoustic imaging will likely continue to be a highly vibrant research field for years to come, the key question of whether MPA imaging could provide significant advantages over nontargeted photoacoustic imaging remains to be answered in the future."

However, a major gap in understanding this process is in establishing how lytic granules pass through the mesh of cortical actin known to underlie the NK cell membrane. Research has been hampered by the resolution of conventional light microscopy, which is too low to resolve cortical actin during lytic granule secretion. Here we use two high-resolution imaging techniques to probe the synaptic organisation of NK cell receptors and filamentous (F)-actin. A combination of optical tweezers and live cell confocal microscopy reveals that microclusters of NKG2D assemble into a ring-shaped structure at the centre of intercellular synapses, where Vav1 and Grb2 also accumulate. Within this ring-shaped organisation of NK cell proteins, lytic granules accumulate for secretion. Using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to gain super-resolution of ~100 nm, cortical actin was detected in a central region of the NK cell synapse irrespective of whether activating or inhibitory signals dominate. Strikingly, the periodicity of the cortical actin mesh increased in specific domains at the synapse when the NK cell was activated. Two-colour super-resolution imaging revealed that lytic granules docked precisely in these domains which were also proximal to where the microtubule-organising centre (MTOC) polarised. Together, these data demonstrate that remodelling of the cortical actin mesh occurs at the central region of the cytolytic NK cell immune synapse. This is likely to occur for other types of cell secretion and also emphasises the importance of emerging super-resolution imaging technology for revealing new biology."

A total of 1014 CARS images were acquired from 92 fresh frozen lung tissue samples. The established pathological workup and diagnostic cellular were used as prior knowledge for establishment of a knowledge-based CARS system using a machine learning approach. This system functions to separate normal, non-neoplastic, and subtypes of lung cancer tissues based on extracted quantitative features describing fibrils and cell morphology. The knowledge-based CARS system showed the ability to distinguish lung cancer from normal and non-neoplastic lung tissue with 91% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Small cell carcinomas were distinguished from nonsmall cell carcinomas with 100% sensitivity and specificity. As an adjunct to submitting tissue samples to routine pathology, our novel system recognizes the patterns of fibril and cell morphology, enabling medical practitioners to perform differential diagnosis of lung lesions in mere minutes. The demonstration of the strategy is also a necessary step toward in vivo point-of-care diagnosis of precancerous and cancerous lung lesions with a fiber-based CARS microendoscope."

The fluorescence decay dynamic was described by average lifetime (tau) and four Laguerre coefficients (LECs) retrieved through a Laguerre deconvolution technique. FLIM-derived parameters discriminated between four groups [elastin-rich (ER), elastin and macrophage-rich (E+M), collagen-rich (CR), and lipid-rich (LR)]. For example, tau(F377) discriminated ER from CR (R = 0.84); tau(F460) discriminated E+M from CR and ER (R = 0.60 and 0.54, respectively); LEC-1(F377) discriminated CR from LR and E+M (R = 0.69 and 0.77, respectively); P < 0.05 for all correlations. Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify this data set with specificity >87% (all cases) and sensitivity as high as 86%.

This paper presents an automatic analysis and classification system for detecting nerve fibres in CCM images based on a multi-scale adaptive dual-model detection algorithm. The algorithm exploits the curvilinear structure of the nerve fibres and adapts itself to the local image information. Detected nerve fibres are then quantified and used as feature vectors for classification using random forest (RF) and neural networks (NNT) classifiers. We show, in a comparative study with other well known curvilinear detectors, that the best performance is achieved by the multi-scale dual model in conjunction with the NNT classifier. An evaluation of clinical effectiveness shows that the performance of the automated system matches that of ground-truth defined by expert manual annotation."

The aim of this work is to improve the classification accuracy based on textural features for the development of a computer assisted screening of oral sub-mucous fibrosis (OSF). In fact, a systematic approach is introduced in order to grade the histopathological tissue sections into normal, OSF without dysplasia and OSF with dysplasia, which would help the oral onco-pathologists to screen the subjects rapidly. In totality, 71 textural features are extracted from epithelial region of the tissue sections using various wavelet families, Gabor-wavelet, local binary pattern, fractal dimension and Brownian motion curve, followed by preprocessing and segmentation. Wavelet families contribute a common set of 9 features, out of which 8 are significant and other 61 out of 62 obtained from the rest of the extractors are also statistically significant (p<0.05) in discriminating the three stages. Based on mean distance criteria, the best wavelet family (i.e., biorthogonal3.1 (bior3.1)) is selected for classifier design. support vector machine (SVM) is trained by 146 samples based on 69 textural features and its classification accuracy is computed for each of the combinations of wavelet family and rest of the extractors. Finally, it has been investigated that bior3.1 wavelet coefficients leads to higher accuracy (88.38%) in combination with LBP and Gabor wavelet features through three-fold cross validation. Results are shown and discussed in detail. It is shown that combining more than one texture measure instead of using just one might improve the overall accuracy."

BACKGROUND: The dimension of the human endolymphatic sac has previously been studied by extrapolating 2-dimensional irregularities on the sectional level into 3-dimensional quantities via unfolding algorithms. These computer renderings require certain geometrical assumptions of the object studied. The term design-based used in the present study signifies that the methods and sampling schemes are defined a priori, in such a manner that consideration of the size, shape, spatial orientation, and distribution of the investigated structures are eliminated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Archival materials of 15 human temporal bones with Meniere's disease and 15 control specimens were investigated by design-based stereology. RESULTS: The total surface area of the endolymphatic sac was significantly lower in the Meniere's disease group (24.8 mm) compared with the control group (47.0 mm), p = 0.006. The volume fraction of the homogenous substance was significantly higher in the Meniere's disease group (17.5%) compared with the control group (5.7%), p = 0.031. No significant differences were found between the volumes of the homogenous substance, the volumes of the endolymphatic sac, and the surface-to-volume ratio in the 2 groups. The study revealed a large biological variation. CONCLUSION: Design-based stereology is a robust, unbiased and efficient tool to quantify 3-dimensional structures derived from 2-dimensional histologic sections. A 2-fold reduction in the surface area of the endolymphatic sac and a 3-fold increase in the volume fraction of homogenous substance in temporal bones with Meniere's disease may, at least in part, be involved in the dysfunction of endolymph fluid homeostasis and the development of endolymphatic hydrops."

Proteins of different species, individually labelled with a single fluorophore, can be imaged as isolated spots (features) of different colour light in different channels, and their diffusive behaviour in cells directly measured through time. Challenges in data analysis have, however, thus far hindered its application in biology. A set of methods for the automated analysis of multidimensional single molecule microscopy data from cells is presented, incorporating Bayesian segmentation-based feature detection, image registration and particle tracking. Single molecules of different colours can be simultaneously detected in noisy, high background data with an arbitrary number of channels, acquired simultaneously or time-multiplexed, and then tracked through time. The resulting traces can be further analysed, for example to detect intensity steps, count discrete intensity levels, measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or changes in polarisation. Examples are shown illustrating the use of the algorithms in investigations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling network, a key target for cancer therapeutics, and with simulated data."

However, over the past decade, IHC as a platform for biomarkers has been challenged by more quantitative molecular assays with reference standards but that lack morphologic context. For IHC to be considered a ""top-tier"" biomarker assay, it must provide truly quantitative data on par with non-morphologic assays, which means it needs to be run with reference standards. However, creating such standards for IHC will require optimizing all aspects of tissue collection, fixation, section thickness, morphologic criteria for assessment, staining processes, digitization of images, and image analysis. This will also require anatomic pathology to evolve from a discipline that is descriptive to one that is quantitative. A major step in this transformation will be replacing traditional ocular microscopes with computer monitors and whole slide images, for without digitization, there can be no accurate quantitation; without quantitation, there can be no standardization; and without standardization, the value of morphology-based IHC assays will not be realized."

METHODS: A total of 21 female virgin rats were randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 rats each. The control group received no intervention; the vaginal distension (VD) group was treated with prolonged VD by balloon inflation; and the VD plus BAPN group was treated with VD plus intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg of BAPN every 3 days. Three weeks later, all the rats underwent conscious cystometric analysis and were then killed for histologic analysis of the urethra. RESULTS: Conscious cystometry identified 0, 3, and 5 rats in the control, VD, and VD plus BAPN groups with an abnormal voiding pattern, respectively. The urethral collagen content was significantly lower in the VD and VD plus BAPN rats compared with the control rats. The urethral elastic fibers were disorganized and shorter in the VD and VD plus BAPN rats and were fragmented and lacking the intermuscle connections in the VD plus BAPN rats. The urethral striated muscle fibers were shorter and more widely spaced in the VD and VD plus BAPN rats than in the control rats. Additionally, those in the VD plus BAPN group exhibited an abnormal wavy shape suggestive of a lack of architectural support. CONCLUSION: Prolonged vaginal distension caused urodynamic changes and histologic abnormalities in the urethra, including reduced collagen content, fragmented elastic fibers, and sparsely arranged and shortened striated muscle fibers. BAPN appears to interfere with the restoration of collagen and elastic fibers."

Unlike the conventional DOF formula, the new methods consider the interplay of geometric and diffraction optics for infinite and finite optical microscopes and for corresponding digital microscope systems. It is shown that in addition to the well understood parameters such as numerical apertures, focal length, and light wavelength, system components such as aperture stops also affect the DOF. For the same objective lens, the DOF is inversely proportional to the size of the aperture stop, and it is proportional to the focal length of the ocular lens. It is also shown that under optimal viewing and operating conditions, the visual accommodation of human observers has no meaningful impact on DOF. The new formulas reported are useful for accurately calculating the DOF of microscopes."

In this study, we explored the spatial and temporal evolution of white matter structures during early brain development using two geometrical diffusion measures, namely, linear (Cl) and planar (Cp) diffusion anisotropies, from 71 longitudinal datasets acquired from 29 healthy, full-term pediatric subjects. The growth trajectories were estimated with generalized estimating equations (GEE) using linear fitting with logarithm of age (days). The presence of the white matter structures in Cl and Cp was observed in neonates, suggesting that both the cylindrical and fanning or crossing structures in various white matter regions may already have been formed at birth. Moreover, we found that both Cl and Cp evolved in a temporally nonlinear and spatially inhomogeneous manner. The growth velocities of Cl in central white matter were significantly higher when compared to peripheral, or more laterally located, white matter: central growth velocity Cl=0.0465+/-0.0273/log(days), versus peripheral growth velocity Cl=0.0198+/-0.0127/log(days), p<10(-)(6). In contrast, the growth velocities of Cp in central white matter were significantly lower than that in peripheral white matter: central growth velocity Cp=0.0014+/-0.0058/log(days), versus peripheral growth velocity Cp=0.0289+/-0.0101/log(days), p<10(-)(6). Depending on the underlying white matter site which is analyzed, our findings suggest that ongoing physiologic and microstructural changes in the developing brain may exert different effects on the temporal evolution of these two geometrical diffusion measures. Thus, future studies utilizing DTI with correlative histological analysis in the study of early brain development are warranted."

While this often takes the form of areas of distinct differentiation into recognized histological subtypes, or different pathological grade, often there are more subtle differences in phenotype which defy accurate classification (Figure 1). Ultimately, since morphology is dictated by the underlying molecular phenotype, areas with visible differences are likely to be accompanied by differences in the expression of proteins which orchestrate cellular function and behavior, and therefore, appearance. The significance of visible and invisible (molecular) heterogeneity for prognosis is unknown, but recent evidence suggests that, at least at the genetic level, heterogeneity exists in the primary tumor(1,2), and some of these sub-clones give rise to metastatic (and therefore lethal) disease. Moreover, some proteins are measured as biomarkers because they are the targets of therapy (for instance ER and HER2 for tamoxifen and trastuzumab (Herceptin), respectively). If these proteins show variable expression within a tumor then therapeutic responses may also be variable. The widely used histopathologic scoring schemes for immunohistochemistry either ignore, or numerically homogenize the quantification of protein expression. Similarly, in destructive techniques, where the tumor samples are homogenized (such as gene expression profiling), quantitative information can be elucidated, but spatial information is lost. Genetic heterogeneity mapping approaches in pancreatic cancer have relied either on generation of a single cell suspension(3), or on macrodissection(4). A recent study has used quantum dots in order to map morphologic and molecular heterogeneity in prostate cancer tissue(5), providing proof of principle that morphology and molecular mapping is feasible, but falling short of quantifying the heterogeneity. Since immunohistochemistry is, at best, only semi-quantitative and subject to intra- and inter-observer bias, more sensitive and quantitative methodologies are required in order to accurately map and quantify tissue heterogeneity in situ. We have developed and applied an experimental and statistical methodology in order to systematically quantify the heterogeneity of protein expression in whole tissue sections of tumors, based on the Automated QUantitative Analysis (AQUA) system(6). Tissue sections are labeled with specific antibodies directed against cytokeratins and targets of interest, coupled to fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies. Slides are imaged using a whole-slide fluorescence scanner. Images are subdivided into hundreds to thousands of tiles, and each tile is then assigned an AQUA score which is a measure of protein concentration within the epithelial (tumor) component of the tissue. Heatmaps are generated to represent tissue expression of the proteins and a heterogeneity score assigned, using a statistical measure of heterogeneity originally used in ecology, based on the Simpson's biodiversity index(7). To date there have been no attempts to systematically map and quantify this variability in tandem with protein expression, in histological preparations. Here, we illustrate the first use of the method applied to ER and HER2 biomarker expression in ovarian cancer. Using this method paves the way for analyzing heterogeneity as an independent variable in studies of biomarker expression in translational studies, in order to establish the significance of heterogeneity in prognosis and prediction of responses to therapy."

Currently, assessed by semiquantitative analysis in the Banff classification, IF quantification is limited by pathologist's subjective interpretation. METHODS: We have designed algorithms dedicated to quantify IF by computerized color image analysis. This innovative and objective software automatically extracts the green areas characteristic of IF in Masson's trichrome based on color image segmentation followed by removal of nonspecific IF staining (capsula, sclerosis glomeruli and normal glomeruli, normal basement membrane) and computes an index. It also counts automatically the number of glomeruli. Sixty-seven Masson stained renal transplant biopsies at various IF stages were imaged using a digital color camera mounted on a microscope. We tested the robustness of the method against varying acquisition parameters. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the parameters do not have an impact on this quantification and that the algorithm is able to handle biopsy color variations. The intra- and interobserver reproducibility was good (P<0.003). The kappa coefficient that was performed on another set of 90 biopsies to evaluate the concordance of our method with an expert Banff quantification was 0.68, indicating a substantial agreement. Finally, the computerized IF correlated with renal function. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that computerized color image analysis is a reliable and reproducible method to evaluate renal IF in routine practice and in multi-centric studies."

Does a higher rate of excision of pigmented skin lesions (PSL) increase the rate of detected melanomas? MATERIAL AND METHODS: The DB-MIPS objective tool, able to evaluate mathematical defined variables, has been used to verify the variability of measurements among PSL stored by five different centres located in Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. RESULTS: The objective analysis showed low differences in terms of moles' features among the different groups, arguing for robustness of the dermatological patient's PSL inspection. Differences in terms of false positives and predictive positive values have been detected. The tendency to follow up a lesion was proportional to the percentage of thin MM (<0.75 mm tumour thickness), while the interventism was proportional to the percentage of dysplastic moles. Similar percentage of thin melanoma has been observed in all the centres, indicating a standardization in early diagnosing among experienced dermatologists. The main difference among the centres was their mode of action, i.e. to follow up or remove suspicious PSL. CONCLUSION: Interventism depends neither on the geographic site nor on the features of the observed moles. Higher removal rates do not correspond to higher MM detections: this means that an in-depth knowledge of melanoma patterns is required and follow-up of suspicious moles is highly suggested."

Various image processing routines that can help investigators evaluate the images are therefore useful. The critical aspect for a reliable automatic image analysis system is a robust segmentation algorithm that can perform accurate segmentation for different cell types. In this study, several image segmentation methods were therefore compared and evaluated in order to identify the most appropriate segmentation schemes that are usable with little new parameterization and robustly with different types of fluorescence-stained cells for various biological and biomedical tasks. The study investigated, compared, and enhanced four different methods for segmentation of cultured epithelial cells. The maximum-intensity linking (MIL) method, an improved MIL, a watershed method, and an improved watershed method based on morphological reconstruction were used. Three manually annotated datasets consisting of 261, 817, and 1,333 HeLa or L929 cells were used to compare the different algorithms. The comparisons and evaluations showed that the segmentation performance of methods based on the watershed transform was significantly superior to the performance of the MIL method. The results also indicate that using morphological opening by reconstruction can improve the segmentation of cells stained with a marker that exhibits the dotted surface of cells."

There have been only a few published reports assessing this disease. Furthermore, many of these reports are from a single institution and span several decades, which may lead to potentially misleading conclusions related to diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating thymoma and can help distinguish thymoma from other anterior mediastinal abnormalities. Tumor stage and extent of resection are the most important prognostic factors. Tumors that are encapsulated and are amenable to complete resection have a good prognosis, whereas invasive and unresectable tumors have a poor prognosis regardless of their histologic characteristics. Radiologists must be aware of the full spectrum of imaging findings of thymoma, the standard guidelines for diagnostic evaluation, and how imaging findings affect therapeutic decisions."

The differential diagnosis varies for each anatomic layer. Dermal lesions that are seen by breast imagers are usually benign skin cysts. Hypodermal lesions, although usually benign, may include lesions that arise from anterior terminal duct lobular units and include papilloma, adenosis, fibroadenoma, and breast cancer. To avoid misclassifying a small superficial breast cancer as a benign dermal lesion, it is necessary to understand superficial breast and skin anatomy and the mammographic, ultrasonographic (U.S.), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signs that indicate that a lesion is dermal. Mammography is the optimal modality for localizing calcifications to the dermis or hypodermis. However, U.S. typically has higher resolution for localizing masses than mammography and MR imaging. At US, a lesion may be categorized as dermal (a) if it is contained entirely within the dermis, (b) if a tract that extends from the lesion to the skin is seen, or (c) if a claw of tissue surrounding the margin of the lesion is present. As with other breast lesions, suspicious imaging features should be sought in addition to determining the anatomic origin. If histologic analysis is necessary to characterize lesions with an unknown cause or origin, precautions must be taken to decrease patient morbidity."

It has mostly been assessed by amplitude and height descriptors. Fractal analysis is derived from fractal geometry and is used to describe the organization of objects found in nature, quantifying their shape complexity with a value. Fractal dimension (Df?) is an index of the space-filling properties of an object and can be used as a parameter that describes the organization of surface roughness. The greater the Df value, the more chaotic the surface topography. The aim of this study was to assess the Df of implants with three different surface topographies to evaluate whether a novel method to measure roughness of implant surface topography could be developed. Forty-five disk-shaped samples (10 x 2 mm) with three different surface topographies were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy: group A, machined surface; group B, sandblasted and acid-etched surface; and group C, sandblasted, acid-etched, and neutralized surface. Images at 20,000x and 50,000x magnification were processed for quantitative analysis of Df using the box-counting method. Df values were correlated to the image magnification. At 20,000x magnification, Df for groups A, B, and C was 1.81, 1.67, and 1.59, respectively. At 50,000x magnification, Df was lower for all examined groups; more specifically, Df was 1.77, 1.59, and 1.42 for groups A, B, and C, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between groups A and C at both magnifications. Df is used widely and successfully as a measurement to characterize anatomical structures and physiologic and pathologic processes. Df not only provides an index of roughness size values, but also a measure of roughness spatial organization; therefore, it could be a promising method to differentiate between rough surfaces capable of supporting osseointegration."

The resulted vignetted image was replicated four times and in each replica a different method for vignetting correction was applied with fiji and gimp software tools. The highest peak signal-to-noise ratio from the comparison of each method to the original image was obtained from the prospective method in all tissues. The morphological filtering method provided the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio value amongst the retrospective methods. The prospective method is suggested as the method of choice for correction of vignetting and if it is not applicable, then the morphological filtering may be suggested as the retrospective alternative method."

The algorithm features an image standardization process that greatly reduces variation in luminance and chrominance between images due to variations in sample preparation. Segmentation of the epithelial regions of images uses an algorithm based on binary graph cuts where graph weights depend on probabilities obtained from colour histogram models of epithelium and stroma image regions. Algorithm training used a data set of 38 images of four types of odontogenic cyst and was tested using a separate data set of 35 images of the same four cyst types. The best parameters for the segmentation algorithm were determined using a response-surface optimizer. The best parameter set resulted in an overall mean (+/- std. dev.) sensitivity of 91.5 +/- 17% and overall mean specificity of 85.1 +/- 18.6% on the training set. Particularly good results were obtained for dentigerous and odontogenic keratocysts for which the mean sensitivities/specificities were 91.9 +/- 6.15%/97.4 +/- 2.15% and 96.1 +/- 1.98%/98.7 +/- 3.16%, respectively.

Such stacks are viewed by users by navigating them through the mouse wheel. We propose a new technique of visualizing 3D point, line or area markers in such focus stacks, by displaying them with a depth-dependent defocus, simulating the microscope's optics; this leverages on the microscopists' ability to continuously twiddle focus, while implicitly performing a shape-from-focus reconstruction of the 3D structure of the sample. User studies confirm that the approach is effective, and can complement more traditional techniques such as color-based cues. We provide two implementations, one of which computes defocus in real time on the GPU, and examples of their application."

The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns. We discuss our approach with respect to a cell probe containing lymphocytes and a prostate tissue section."

Enhanced acquisition speed, resolution, and automation of sample handling are enabling researchers to probe biological phenomena at an increasing rate and achieve intuitive image-based results. However, the rich image sets produced by these tools are massive, possessing potentially millions of frames with tremendous depth and complexity. As a result, the tools introduce immense computational requirements, and, more importantly, the fact that image analysis operates at a much lower speed than image acquisition limits its ability to play a role in critical tasks in biomedicine such as real-time decision making. In this work, we present our strategy for high-throughput image analysis on a graphical processing unit platform. We scrutinized our original algorithm for detecting, tracking, and analyzing cell morphology in high-speed images and identified inefficiencies in image filtering and potential shortcut routines in the morphological analysis stage. Using our ""grid method"" for image enhancements resulted in an 8.54x reduction in total run time, whereas origin centering allowed using a look up table for coordinate transformation, which reduced the total run time by 55.64x. Optimization of parallelization and implementation of specialized image processing hardware will ultimately enable real-time analysis of high-throughput image streams and bring wider adoption of assays based on new imaging technologies."

METHODS: Thirty-two root canals of permanent teeth were used. The angles of curvature of the canals were calculated on digital radiographs. The initial WL with K-files was transferred to the matched WaveOne Primary reciprocating files. After glide paths were established with PathFile (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), canals were shaped with WaveOne Primary referring to the initial WL. The difference between the postinstrumentation canal length and the initial canal length was analyzed by using a fiberoptic inspection microscope. Data were analyzed with a balanced 2-way factorial analysis of variance (P < .05). RESULTS: Referring to the initial WL, 24 of 32 WaveOne Primary files projected beyond the experimental apical foramen (minimum-maximum, 0.14-0.76 mm). A significant decrease in the canal length after instrumentation (95% confidence interval ranging from -0.34 mm to -0.26 mm) was detected. The canal curvature significantly influenced the WL variation (F(1) = 30.65, P < .001). The interaction between the initial canal length and the canal curvature was statistically significant (F(2) = 4.38, P = .014). CONCLUSIONS: Checking the WL before preparation of the apical third of the root canal is recommended when using the new WaveOne NiTi single-file system."

In this paper we will present such an approach, which we first used on the follicular lymphoma images. Lymphoma is a broad term encompassing a variety of cancers of the lymphatic system. Lymphoma is differentiated by the type of cell that multiplies and how the cancer presents itself. It is very important to get an exact diagnosis regarding lymphoma and to determine the treatments that will be most effective for the patient's condition. Our work was focused on the identification of lymphomas by finding follicles in microscopy images provided by the Laboratory of Pathology in the University Hospital of Tenerife, Spain. We divided our work in two stages: in the first stage we did image pre-processing and feature extraction, and in the second stage we used different symbolic machine learning approaches for pixel classification. Symbolic machine learning approaches are often neglected when looking for image analysis tools. They are not only known for a very appropriate knowledge representation, but also claimed to lack computational power. The results we got are very promising and show that symbolic approaches can be successful in image analysis applications."

APPROACH: Electronic publication in Pathology offers new features of scientific communication in pathology that cannot be obtained by conventional paper based journals. Most of these features are based upon completely open or partly directed interaction between the reader and the system that distributes the article. One of these interactions can be applied to microscopic images allowing the reader to navigate and magnify the presented images. VS and interactive Virtual Microscopy (VM) are a tool to increase the scientific value of microscopic images. TECHNOLOGY AND PERFORMANCE: The open access journal Diagnostic Pathology http://www.diagnosticpathology.org has existed for about five years. It is a peer reviewed journal that publishes all types of scientific contributions, including original scientific work, case reports and review articles. In addition to digitized still images the authors of appropriate articles are requested to submit the underlying glass slides to an institution (DiagnomX.eu, and Leica.com) for digitalization and documentation. The images are stored in a separate image data bank which is adequately linked to the article. The normal review process is not involved. Both processes (peer review and VS acquisition) are performed contemporaneously in order to minimize a potential publication delay. VS are not provided with a DOI index (digital object identifier). The first articles that include VS were published in March 2011. RESULTS AND PERSPECTIVES: Several logistic constraints had to be overcome until the first articles including VS could be published. Step by step an automated acquisition and distribution system had to be implemented to the corresponding article. The acceptance of VS by the reader is high as well as by the authors. Of specific value are the increased confidence to and reputation of authors as well as the presented information to the reader. Additional associated functions such as access to author-owned related image collections, reader-controlled automated image measurements and image transformations are in preparation.

Epub 2011 Jan 7.,Wang J,Eur J Radiol,2012,2011/01/11,,,10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.12.013,"BACKGROUND: The accurate evaluation of liver fibrosis stage is important in determining the treatment strategy. The limitations of percutaneous liver biopsy as the gold standard are obvious for invasion. Real-time elastography with conventional ultrasound probes and a new quantitative technology for diffuse histological lesion is a novel approach for staging of liver fibrosis. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the value of real-time tissue elastography with a new quantitative technology for the assessment of liver fibrosis stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time elastography was performed in 55 patients with liver fibrosis and chronic hepatitis B and in 20 healthy volunteers. Eleven parameters for every patient in colorcode image obtained from the real-time elastography were analyzed with principal components analysis. We analyzed the correlation between elasticity index and liver fibrosis stage and the accuracy of real-time elastography for liver fibrosis staging. Additionally, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index was also included in the analysis. RESULTS: The Spearman's correlation coefficient between the elasticity index and the histologic fibrosis stage was 0.81, which is highly significant (p<0.001). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves indicating diagnostic accuracy were 0.93 (F>/=F1, p<0.001) for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis, 0.92 (F>/=F2, p<0.001), 0.84 (F>/=F3, p<0.05) and 0.66 (F=F4, p>0.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time elastography with a new quantitative technology for diffuse histological lesion is a new and promising sonography-based noninvasive method for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B."

In a number of cases in surgical pathology, morphometric quantitation is already performed manually or semi-quantitatively, with this effort contributing to diagnostic workup. Digital whole slide imaging, coupled with emerging image analysis algorithms, offers great promise as an adjunctive tool for the surgical pathologist in areas of screening, quality assurance, consistency, and quantitation. We have recently reported such an algorithm, SIVQ (Spatially Invariant Vector Quantization), which avails itself of the geometric advantages of ring vectors for pattern matching, and have proposed a number of potential applications. One key test, however, remains the need for demonstration and optimization of SIVQ for discrimination between foreground (neoplasm- malignant epithelium) and background (normal parenchyma, stroma, vessels, inflammatory cells). Especially important is the determination of relative contributions of each key SIVQ matching parameter with respect to the algorithm's overall detection performance. Herein, by combinatorial testing of SIVQ ring size, sub-ring number, and inter-ring wobble parameters, in the setting of a morphologically complex bladder cancer use case, we ascertain the relative contributions of each of these parameters towards overall detection optimization using urothelial carcinoma as a use case, providing an exemplar by which this algorithm and future histology-oriented pattern matching tools may be validated and subsequently, implemented broadly in other appropriate microscopic classification settings."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant reader study obtained informed consent from all subjects. Four blinded Mammography Quality Standards Act-certified academic radiologists individually evaluated DBT images and MSVs of 67 masses (30 malignant, 37 benign) in 67 women (age range, 34-88 years). Images were viewed in random order at separate counterbalanced sessions and were rated for visibility (10-point scale), likelihood of malignancy (12-point scale), and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification. Differences in mass visibility were analyzed by using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. Reader performance was measured by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)) and partial area index above a sensitivity threshold of 0.90 (A(z)(0.90)) by using likelihood of malignancy ratings. Masses categorized as BI-RADS 4 or 5 were compared with histopathologic analysis to determine true-positive results for each modality. RESULTS: Mean mass visibility ratings were slightly better with DBT (range, 3.2-4.4) than with MSV (range, 3.8-4.8) for all four readers, with one reader's improvement achieving statistical significance (P = .001). The A(z) ranged 0.89-0.93 for DBT and 0.88-0.93 for MSV (P >/= .23). The A(z)((0.90)) ranged 0.36-0.52 for DBT and 0.25-0.40 for MSV (P >/= .20). The readers characterized seven additional malignant masses as BI-RADS 4 or 5 with DBT than with MSV, at a cost of five false-positive biopsy recommendations, with a mean of 1.8 true-positive (range, 0-3) and 1.3 false-positive (range, -1 to 4) assessments per reader. CONCLUSION: In this small study, mass characterization in terms of visibility ratings, reader performance, and BI-RADS assessment with DBT was similar to that with MSVs. Preliminary findings suggest that MSV might not be necessary for mass characterization when performing DBT."

Until today, only a few pathology institutions take use of this new technology, although it is available since several years. Why? DESIGN: Virtual microscopy requires a new workflow organisation in the pathologist's diagnostic procedure. At a first view, the laboratory workflow seems to remain untouched to a high degree. However, the used laboratory information system (LIS), which is commonly built in a hierarchic order, has to be adjusted at its highest levels, i.e., diagnosis statement, quality evaluation, submission to the clinician (hospital information system), and feedback to the laboratory. Therefore, the laboratory's workflow is involved at all levels too, and the LIS has to be changed or adjusted to the requirements of VM. VM systems are usually equipped with a viewer that mimics the viewing of a conventional microscope, and do not offer access to sensitive nodes of the LIS. Similar, LIS are usually closed and fixed systems because of data security and certification demands. Thus, VM systems have to possess communication access at different LIS levels together with steering commands for the LIS in close association with the diagnostic quality and efficiency (for example demands for additional stains, immunohistochemical or quantitative image methods, etc.), as well as expert consultation, or panel discussion. OUTCOME: An implementation of an open and active LIS - VM management system could significantly promote the introduction of VM into routine diagnostic surgical pathology. The management system has to coordinate and translate the demands of VM to LIS (and vice versa), and to assure the communication with HIS. Mandatory features include streaming of the laboratory workflow, feedback commands to LIS, as well as regulation of temporary priority levels. CONCLUSION: A successful implementation of VM systems in routine tissue-based diagnosis requires communicative management systems as long as VM is considered to be a ""stand alone system"" that just mimics a conventional microscope."

OBJECTIVES: To establish such a model, we studied the relationship between elastase dose and the severity of emphysema in female C57BL/6J mice. We compared alveolar fractal box dimension (D(B)), a new measure which is an assessment of the complexity of the tissue, with mean linear intercept (L(m)), which is commonly used to estimate airspace size, for sensitivity and efficiency of measurement. METHODS: Emphysema was induced in female C57BL/6J mice by administering increasing intratracheal doses of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). Changes in morphology and static lung compliance (C(L)) were examined 21 days later. Correlation of D(B) with L(m) was determined in histological sections of lungs exposed to PPE. The inverse relationship between D(B) and L(m) was supported by examining similar morphological sections from another experiment where the development of emphysema was studied 1 to 3 weeks after instillation of human neutrophil elastase (HNE). RESULTS: L(m) increased with PPE dose in a sigmoidal curve. C(L) increased after 80 or 120 U/kg body weight (P < 0.05), but not after 40 U/kg, compared with the control. D(B) progressively declined from 1.66 +/- 0.002 (standard error of the mean) in controls, to 1.47 +/- 0.006 after 120 U PPE/kg (P < 0.0001). After PPE or HNE instillation, D(B) was inversely related to L(m) (R = -0.95, P < 0.0001 and R = -0.84, P = 0.01, respectively), with a more negative slope of the relationship using HNE (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Intratracheal instillation of increasing doses of PPE yields a scale of progression from mild to severe emphysema. D(B) correlates inversely with L(m) after instillation of either PPE or HNE and yields a rapid, sensitive measure of emphysema after elastase instillation."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of adaptive nuclear texture features in early stage ovarian cancer. METHODS: 246 cases of early stage ovarian cancer were included in the analysis. Isolated nuclei (monolayers) were prepared from 50 mum tissue sections and stained with Feulgen-Schiff. Local gray level entropy was measured within small windows of each nuclear image and stored in gray level entropy matrices. A compact set of adaptive features was computed from these matrices. RESULTS: Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly better relapse-free survival (p < 0.001) for patients with low adaptive feature values compared to patients with high adaptive feature values. The 10-year relapse-free survival was about 78% for patients with low feature values and about 52% for patients with high feature values. Adaptive features were found to be of independent prognostic significance for relapse-free survival in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Adaptive nuclear texture features from entropy matrices contain prognostic information and are of independent prognostic significance for relapse-free survival in early stage ovarian cancer."

We propose and examine a computer-aided and fractal-based image analysis technique to quantify the microvascularity in histological specimens of WHO grade II and III gliomas. A computer-aided and fractal-based analysis was used to describe the microvessels and to quantify their geometrical complexity in histological specimens collected from 17 patients. The statistical analysis showed that the fractal-based indexes are the most discriminant parameters to describe the microvessels. The computer-aided quantitative analysis also showed that grade III gliomas are generally more vascularized than grade II gliomas. The fractal parameters are reliable quantitative indicators of the neoplastic microvasculature, making them potential surrogate biomarkers. The qualitative evaluation currently performed by the neuropathologist can be combined with the computer-assisted quantitative analysis of the microvascularity to improve the diagnosis and optimize the treatment of patients with brain cancer."

This demands high-throughput image processing to enable analysis of these tissue samples for diagnosis of cancer and other conditions. In this paper, we present a completely automated method for the accurate detection and localization of tissue cores that is based on geometric restoration of the core shapes without placing any assumptions on grid geometry. The method relies on hierarchical clustering in conjunction with the Davies-Bouldin index for cluster validation in order to estimate the number of cores in the image wherefrom we estimate the core radius and refine this estimate using morphological granulometry. The final stage of the algorithm reconstructs circular discs from core sections such that these discs cover the entire region of each core regardless of the precise shape of the core. The results show that the proposed method is able to reconstruct core locations without any evidence of localization. Furthermore, the algorithm is more efficient than existing methods based on the Hough transform for circle detection. The algorithm's simplicity, accuracy, and computational efficiency allow for automated high-throughput analysis of microarray images."

Here, we show the unusual finding of spontaneously mummified brain tissue from several individuals from the little known megalithic talaiotic culture of the island of Minorca, dating approximately 3,000 years before present and corresponding to the late Mediterranean Bronze Age. METHODS: These individuals were part of an intact burial site containing 66 subjects. Intracraneal samples were carefully rehydrated with Sandison's solution. We used classical histochemical as well as 2D and 3D (scanning) electron-microscopic techniques. RESULTS: We provide evidence of the nervous nature of the samples as well as a detailed description of the morphological features of these ancient tissues. The intracranial material consisted of well-preserved eosinophilic reticular tissue and, although mostly absent, some exceptional pigment-containing neurons were identified. CONCLUSIONS: We present a detailed morphological analysis which can provide valuable information and guidelines for the interpretation of this scarce type of mummified samples and provide explanations for this surprising preservation."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Histological samples from 104 patients of breast carcinoma were retrospectively studied by computerized nuclear DNA cytometry. Isolated nuclei from paraffin sections were stained with Feulgen stain and DNA was measured using a computer-assisted image analysis cytometry system. In each case, 200 nuclei were measured and the DNA histograms, S phase fraction (SPF) and number of cells above 5c and 9c were determined. We applied different approaches in the analysis of DNA to compare the DNA histograms with different clinicopathological features and survival. RESULTS: The mean of DNA ploidy mode for all tumors was 3.43; 82.7% of tumors were aneuploid and 17.3% were diploid. The median SPF was 3.5% for DNA diploid and 13.5% for DNA aneuploid tumors. DNA aneuploid tumors and high SPF were associated with advanced stage, distant metastasis, high histological grade and lymph node involvement. The SPF was also associated with large tumor size and with younger patients (<50 years). In the overall population (median follow-up 51 months), patients with aneuploid DNA histograms and high SPF values had shorter survival times than those with diploid DNA histograms and low SPF values (p = 0.001, p < 0.0001, respectively). Also, short survival was associated with a multiploid DNA histogram and with DNA aneuploid cells >/=5 cells (p < 0.0001, p = 0.001, respectively). In a Cox multivariate analysis, DNA ploidy (p = 0.010), age (p = 0.038) and clinical stage (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of overall survival, and DNA ploidy (p = 0.018) and clinical stage (p = 0.001) also proved to be independent predictors of disease-specific survival. The SPF cutoff point of 11% might be applied to separate patients into good and poor prognosis groups. CONCLUSIONS: DNA image cytometry with careful analysis of the histograms may provide valuable prognostic information in Libyan breast cancer, with potential clinical implications in patient management, particularly in predicting the patients at high risk for metastasis and recurrence who should be considered as candidates for combined adjuvant therapy."

This preliminary study investigated whether diagnostics for CIN can potentially be improved using semiautomatic colposcopic image analysis. METHODS: 198 women with unremarkable or abnormal smears underwent colposcopy examinations. 375 regions of interest (ROIs) were manually marked on digital screen shots of the streaming documentation, which we provided during our colposcopic examinations (39 normal findings, 41 CIN I, and 118 CIN II-III). These ROIs were classified into two groups (211 regions with normal findings and CIN I, and 164 regions with CIN II-III). We developed a prototypical computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) device based on image-processing methods to automatically characterize the color, texture, and granulation of the ROIs. RESULTS: Using n-fold cross-validation, the CAD system achieved a maximum diagnostic accuracy of 80% (sensitivity 85% and specificity 75%) corresponding to a correct assignment of abnormal or unremarkable findings. CONCLUSIONS: The CAD system may be able to play a supportive role in the further diagnosis of CIN, potentially paving the way for new and enhanced developments in colposcopy-based diagnosis."

In these systems, the first step is usually cell segmentation that greatly affects the success of the subsequent system steps. On the other hand, similar to other image segmentation problems, cell segmentation is an ill-posed problem that typically necessitates the use of domain-specific knowledge to obtain successful segmentations even by human subjects. The approaches that can incorporate this knowledge into their segmentation algorithms have potential to greatly improve segmentation results. In this work, we propose a new approach for the effective segmentation of live cells from phase contrast microscopy. This approach introduces a new set of ""smart markers"" for a marker-controlled watershed algorithm, for which the identification of its markers is critical. The proposed approach relies on using domain-specific knowledge, in the form of visual characteristics of the cells, to define the markers. We evaluate our approach on a total of 1,954 cells. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach, which uses the proposed definition of smart markers, is quite effective in identifying better markers compared to its counterparts. This will, in turn, be effective in improving the segmentation performance of a marker-controlled watershed algorithm."

These features are used to classify a gland segment into one of the three classes: artifact, normal gland and cancer gland. On a dataset of 48 images at 5x magnification (which includes 525 artifacts, 931 normal glands and 1,375 cancer glands), we achieved the following classification accuracies: 93% for artifacts v. true glands; 79% for normal v. cancer glands, and 77% for discriminating all three classes. The proposed method outperforms state of the art methods in terms of segmentation and classification accuracies and computational efficiency."

The method uses a representation of the image data set based on bag of features histograms built from visual dictionary of Haar-based patches and a novel visual latent semantic strategy for characterizing the visual content of a set of images.

The method was evaluated on a challenging problem involving automated discrimination of medulloblastoma tumors based on image derived attributes from whole slide images as anaplastic or non-anaplastic. The data set comprised 10 labeled histopathological patient studies, 5 for anaplastic and 5 for non-anaplastic, where 750 square images cropped randomly from cancerous region from whole slide per study. The experimental results show that the new method is competitive in terms of classification accuracy achieving 0.87 in average."

By employing the optical marker pHluorin, we are able to visualize synaptic vesicle release with a spatial resolution in the nm range in a non-invasive manner. We compute individual synaptic signals from automatically segmented regions of interest and detect peaks that represent synaptic activity using a continuous wavelet transform based algorithm. As opposed to standard peak detection algorithms, we employ multiple wavelets to match all relevant features of the peak. We evaluate our multiple wavelet algorithm (MWA) on real data and assess the performance on synthetic data over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios."

We find the global dense correspondence between the sections by SIFT Flow algorithm, evaluate the features of the corresponding pixels and use them to perform the segmentation. Our method is 3.6 and 6.4% more accurate in two different accuracy metrics than the algorithm with no context from other sections."

Though many papers propose means for improving color constancy, the vast majority assume image formation via reflective light instead of light transmission as in microscopy, and thus are inappropriate for histological analysis. Previously, we presented a novel Bayesian color segmentation algorithm for histological images that is highly robust to color nonstandardness; this algorithm employed the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to dynamically estimate for each individual image the probability density functions that describe the colors of salient objects. However, our approach, like most EM-based algorithms, ignored important spatial constraints, such as those modeled by Markov random field (MRFs). Addressing this deficiency, we now present spatially-constrained EM (SCEM), a novel approach for incorporating Markov priors into the EM framework. With respect to our segmentation system, we replace EM with SCEM and then assess its improved ability to segment nuclei in H&E stained histopathology. Segmentation performance is evaluated over seven (nearly) identical sections of gastrointestinal tissue stained using different protocols (simulating severe color nonstandardness). Over this dataset, our system identifies nuclear regions with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.838. If we disregard spatial constraints, the AUC drops to 0.748."

Due to the inherently weak fluorescence, CLSM images exhibit a low SNR. We present a novel model for the transfer of signal and noise in CLSM that is both theoretically sound as well as corroborated by a rigorous analysis of the pixel intensity statistics via measurement of the 3D noise power spectra, signal-dependence and distribution. Our model provides a better fit to the data than previously proposed models. Further, it forms the basis for (i) the simulation of the CLSM imaging process indispensable for the quantitative evaluation of CLSM image analysis algorithms, (ii) the application of Poisson denoising algorithms and (iii) the reconstruction of the fluorescence signal."

As a result, our algorithm successfully distinguishes synapses from the numerous other organelles that appear within an EM volume, including those whose local textural properties are relatively similar. This enables us to achieve very high detection rates with very few false positives."

The computational analysis was usually performed on patch level where only a small part of the slice is covered. However, slice-based classification is more realistic for histopathological diagnosis. The developed method combines both textural and structural features from patch images and proposes a two level classification scheme. In the first level, the patches in slices are classified into possible classes (adenomatous, inflamed, cancer and normal) and the distribution of the patches into these classes is considered as the information representing the slices. Then the slices are classified using a logistic linear classifier. In patch level, we obtain the correct classification accuracies of 94.36% and 96.34% for the cancer and normal classes, respectively. However, in slice level, the accuracies of the 79.17% and 92.68% are achieved for cancer and normal classes, respectively."

Epub 2012 Dec 5.,Kim HH,Comput Math Methods Med,2012,2013/01/11,PMC3523148,,10.1155/2012/893040,"A model with its conductivity varying highly across a very thin layer will be considered. It is related to a stable phantom model, which is invented to generate a certain apparent conductivity inside a region surrounded by a thin cylinder with holes. The thin cylinder is an insulator and both inside and outside the thin cylinderare filled with the same saline. The injected current can enter only through the holes adopted to the thin cylinder. The model has a high contrast of conductivity discontinuity across the thin cylinder and the thickness of the layer and the size of holes are very small compared to the domain of the model problem. Numerical methods for such a model require a very fine mesh near the thin layer to resolve the conductivity discontinuity. In this work, an efficient numerical method for such a model problem is proposed by employing a uniform mesh, which need not resolve the conductivity discontinuity. The discrete problem is then solved by an iterative method, where the solution is improved by solving a simple discrete problem with a uniform conductivity. At each iteration, the right-hand side is updated by integrating the previous iterate over the thin cylinder. This process results in a certain smoothing effect on microscopic structures and our discrete model can provide a more practical tool for simulating the apparent conductivity. The convergence of the iterative method is analyzed regarding the contrast in the conductivity and the relative thickness of the layer. In numerical experiments, solutions of our method are compared to reference solutions obtained from COMSOL, where very fine meshes are used to resolve the conductivity discontinuity in the model. Errors of the voltage in L(2) norm follow O(h) asymptotically and the current density matches quitewell those from the reference solution for a sufficiently small mesh size h. The experimental results present a promising feature of our approach for simulating the apparent conductivity related to changes in microscopic cellular structures."

In this paper, we develop a novel scale normalization model for histopathological images based on nuclear area distributions. Results indicate that the normalization model closely fits empirical values for two renal tumor datasets. We study the effect of scale normalization on classification of renal tumor images. Scale normalization improves classification performance in most cases. However, performance decreases in a few cases. In order to understand this, we propose two methods to filter extracted image features that are sensitive to image scaling and features that are uncorrelated with scaling factor. Feature filtering improves the classification performance of cases that were initially negatively affected by scale normalization."

It is responsible for up to one million deaths a year, a number that could rise due to increasing multi-drug resistance to all antimalarial drugs currently available. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the discovery of new drug therapies. Recently, our laboratory developed a simple one-step fluorescence-based live cell-imaging assay to integrate the complex biology of the human malaria parasite into drug discovery. Here we used our newly developed live cell-imaging platform to discover novel marine natural products and their cellular phenotypic effects against the most lethal malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: A high content live cell imaging platform was used to screen marine extracts effects on malaria. Parasites were grown in vitro in the presence of extracts, stained with RNA sensitive dye, and imaged at timed intervals with the BD Pathway HT automated confocal microscope. RESULTS: Image analysis validated our new methodology at a larger scale level and revealed potential antimalarial activity of selected extracts with a minimal cytotoxic effect on host red blood cells. To further validate our assay, we investigated parasite's phenotypes when incubated with the purified bioactive natural product bromophycolide A. We show that bromophycolide A has a strong and specific morphological effect on parasites, similar to the ones observed from the initial extracts. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results show that high-content live cell-imaging (HCLCI) can be used to screen chemical libraries and identify parasite specific inhibitors with limited host cytotoxic effects. All together we provide new leads for the discovery of novel antimalarials."

The aim of this study was to apply the FIB/SEM and SEM/EDS analysis to the interfaces of a metal-ceramic vs. two zirconia-ceramic systems. Plate samples of three different prosthetic systems were prepared in the dental lab following the manufacturers' instructions, where metal-ceramic was the result of a ceramic veneering (porcelain-fused-to-metal) and the two zirconia-ceramic systems were produced by the dedicated CAD-CAM procedures of the zirconia cores (both with final sintering) and then veneered by layered or heat pressed ceramics. In a FIB/SEM equipment (also called DualBeam), a thin layer of platinum (1 mum) was deposited on samples surface crossing the interfaces, in order to protect them during milling. Then, increasingly deeper trenches were milled by a focused ion beam, first using a relatively higher and later using a lower ion current (from 9 nA to 0.28 nA, 30KV). Finally, FEG-SEM (5KV) micrographs (1000-50,000X) were acquired. In a SEM the analysis of the morphology and internal microstructure was performed by 13KV secondary and backscattered electrons signals (in all the samples). The compositional maps were then performed by EDS probe only in the metal-ceramic system (20kV). Despite the presence of many voids in all the ceramic layers, it was possible to identify: (1) the grain structures of the metallic and zirconia substrates, (2) the thin oxide layer at the metal-ceramic interface and its interactions with the first ceramic layer (wash technique), (3) the roughness of the two different zirconia cores and their interactions with the ceramic interface, where the presence of zirconia grains in the ceramic layer was reported in two system possibly due to sandblasting before ceramic firing."

The correct identification of the epileptogenic hippocampus (the 'generator') vs the non-epileptogenic (the 'receiver') may lead to better surgical planning and results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 14 patients with MTLE (eight left and six right) who became seizure free after unilateral hippocampal resection, with hippocampal sclerosis confirmed by histology. Hippocampal tridimensional morphometry was performed comparing patients and healthy controls employing a voxel-wise Wilcoxon test. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons with the application of a False Discovery Rate (FDR)-corrected threshold for q < 0.05. RESULTS: Patients with MTLE showed atrophy involving the ipsilateral hippocampus and the contralateral hippocampus, more pronouncedly within the ipsilateral hippocampus in the anterior-inferior aspect of the hippocampal head (left MTLE, left hippocampus x = -28, y = -16, z = -24, Z = 3.6; right MTLE, right hippocampus x = 22, y = -11, z = -27, Z = 2.9). On the contralateral hippocampus, the atrophy was more noticeable in the posterior head and body areas. CONCLUSION: The epileptogenic hippocampal atrophy has an anatomically distinct pattern compared with the contralateral hippocampus. This information may help guide the presurgical assessment of MTLE."

METHODS: This was a prospective study of fetal hearts between 9 and 14 weeks' gestation. For ex-vivo 3D analysis, 30 human fetal hearts (at 9 + 0 to 14 + 6 weeks) were retrieved from surgical terminations of pregnancy. The specimens were embedded in resin and episcopic ('block-face') imaging was used to obtain a digital volume dataset (HREM) using 3-micron slicing. 4D-HRTVS was performed in 28 separate pregnancies at 10 + 2 to 14 + 0 weeks using a Voluson E8 ultrasound machine with volumetric transvaginal RIC 6-12-MHz transducers. Heart volumes obtained by both methods were compared to assess their ability to demonstrate first-trimester cardiac morphology. Comparisons were made in the transverse and sagittal planes, and using volume rendering. RESULTS: All hearts were structurally normal, although abdominal situs was not examined in the isolated hearts that underwent HREM. 4D-HRTVS demonstrated each of the complete five transverse cardiac views in 32-86% of cases. HREM showed four features unique to the first-trimester human heart: prominent atrial appendages, spiral ventricular arrangement, prominent coronary arteries and thickened arterial walls. 4D-HRTVS could demonstrate the first two, but ultrasound resolution was too poor to quantify wall thickness and demonstrate coronary arteries in the 3-5-mm diameter heart. CONCLUSIONS: 4D-HRTVS showed limited morphological features of the first-trimester fetal heart compared with HREM. HREM provides a gold standard of ex-vivo imaging against which developments in ultrasound resolution could be compared."

Histopathological images have widely been used in the differential diagnosis of normal, oral precancerous (oral sub-mucous fibrosis (OSF)) and cancer lesions. However, this technique is limited by subjective interpretations and less accurate diagnosis. The objective of this work is to improve the classification accuracy based on textural features in the development of a computer assisted screening of OSF. The approach introduced here is to grade the histopathological tissue sections into normal, OSF without Dysplasia (OSFWD) and OSF with Dysplasia (OSFD), which would help the oral onco-pathologists to screen the subjects rapidly. The biopsy sections are stained with H&E. The optical density of the pixels in the light microscopic images is recorded and represented as matrix quantized as integers from 0 to 255 for each fundamental color (Red, Green, Blue), resulting in a MxNx3 matrix of integers. Depending on either normal or OSF condition, the image has various granular structures which are self similar patterns at different scales termed ""texture"". We have extracted these textural changes using Higher Order Spectra (HOS), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Laws Texture Energy (LTE) from the histopathological images (normal, OSFWD and OSFD). These feature vectors were fed to five different classifiers: Decision Tree (DT), Sugeno Fuzzy, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) to select the best classifier. Our results show that combination of texture and HOS features coupled with Fuzzy classifier resulted in 95.7% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 94.5% and 98.8% respectively. Finally, we have proposed a novel integrated index called Oral Malignancy Index (OMI) using the HOS, LBP, LTE features, to diagnose benign or malignant tissues using just one number. We hope that this OMI can help the clinicians in making a faster and more objective detection of benign/malignant oral lesions."

Simultaneous or consecutive image acquisition of a single specimen, using multiple techniques, increases the amount of measurable information available. In order to benefit from each modality, it is necessary to accurately co-register data sets. Intrinsic differences in the image formation process employed by each modality result in images which possess different characteristics. In addition, as a result of using different measurement devices, images often differ in size and can suffer relative geometrical deformations including rotation, scale and translation, making registration a complex problem. Current methods generally rely on manual input and are therefore subject to human error. Here, we present an automated image registration tool for fluorescence microscopy. We show that it successfully registers images obtained via total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), or epi-fluorescence, and confocal microscopy. Furthermore, we provide several other applications including channel merging following image acquisition through an emission beam splitter, and lateral stage drift correction. We also discuss areas of membrane trafficking which could benefit from application of Auto-Align. Auto-Align is an essential item in the advanced microscopist's toolbox which can create a synergy of single or multi-modality image data."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We prospectively compared images obtained during compression with an ultrasound probe and noncompressed ultrasound images of 180 pathologically proven thyroid masses (51 malignant, 129 benign) smaller than 2 cm in 169 patients (127 women, 42 men; mean age, 51.2 years). The size (anteroposterior and transverse dimensions) and shape (ratio of anteroposterior to transverse dimension) of the selected lesions were measured on both noncompressed and compressed ultrasound images at a computer workstation, and the compressibility (anteroposterior-to-transverse ratio on noncompressed images minus anteroposterior-to-transverse ratio on compressed images) was calculated. Compressibility was analyzed to determine its association with histopathologic results (benign versus malignant) and the characteristics of the thyroid mass (involved lobe, location in lobe, halo, and composition). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used as an indicator of performance. RESULTS: The mean anteroposterior-to-transverse ratio of a thyroid mass on compressed ultrasound images was significantly lower than that on noncompressed images (0.78 +/- 0.28 vs 0.92 +/- 0.30; p < 0.001). The compressibility of masses was greater for benign than for malignant lesions (0.19 +/- 0.16 vs 0.05 +/- 0.12; p < 0.001). No statistically significant association was identified between compressibility and other characteristics of a lesion. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for compressibility of thyroid masses was 0.78. On the basis of a cutoff value for malignancy of compressibility less than 0.10, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 72.5%, 72.9%, and 72.8%. CONCLUSION: Compressibility with an ultrasound probe is a useful criterion for differentiating benign from malignant lesions of the thyroid."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained. Surgical resection specimens of 74 malignant breast lesions in 74 women (mean age, 55 years; age range, 32-78 years) who had undergone contrast-enhanced US were included. Different contrast enhancement patterns (enhancement degree, order, and margin; internal homogeneity; perfusion defect; and radial or penetrating vessels) and parameters (wash-in time, peak intensity, time to peak, area under the time-intensity curve, ascending slope, and descending slope) were evaluated. Pathologic prognostic factors, including histologic grade, lymph node status, tumor diameter, microvessel density (MVD), estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and c-erb-B2, p53, and Ki-67 expression were determined. Correlation of enhancement patterns and parameters with prognostic factors was analyzed with the Pearson chi2 test, Spearman rank correlation test, and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Some enhancement features were associated, albeit not significantly, with prognostic factors. Perfusion defect was the most accurate enhancement criterion for higher histologic grade (grade III) (P=.016), negative estrogen receptor expression (P=.006), positive c-erb-B2 expression (P=.013), larger tumor diameter (>/=2 cm) (P=.016), and increased MVD (P=.019). Radial or penetrating vessels were associated with lymph node status (P=.010). Hyperenhancement may be useful in reflecting increased MVD (P=.008) and positive p53 expression (P=.037). For contrast enhancement parameters, ascending slope was the best discrimination criterion for proliferative activity (P=.003). CONCLUSION: Enhancement patterns and parameters of contrast-enhanced US may be useful in the noninvasive prediction of prognostic factors of breast cancers."

Completeness of resection of brain tumors improves quality of life and survival; however, that is often difficult to accomplish. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using multimodal confocal imaging for intraoperative detection of brain neoplasms. We have imaged different types of benign and malignant, primary and metastatic brain tumors. We correlated optical images with histopathology and evaluated the possibility of interpreting confocal images in a manner similar to pathology. Surgical specimens were briefly stained in 0.05 mg/ml aqueous solution of methylene blue (MB) and imaged using a multimodal confocal microscope. Reflectance and fluorescence signals of MB were excited at 642 nm. Fluorescence emission of MB was registered between 670 and 710 nm. After imaging, tissues were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histopathology. The results of comparison demonstrate good correlation between fluorescence images and histopathology. Reflectance images provide information about morphology and vascularity of the specimens, complementary to that provided by fluorescence images. Multimodal confocal imaging has the potential to aid in the intraoperative detection of microscopic deposits of brain neoplasms. The application of this technique may improve completeness of resection and increase patient survival."

The image processing algorithm is based on an optimized Hough transform, applied to the external border of the aggregate. This achieves a significant data reduction by decomposing the particle border into fragments, which are assumed to be spheres in the present application, consistent with the known morphology of soot aggregates. Unlike traditional techniques, which are ultimately reliant on manual (human) measurement of a small sample of primary particles from a subset of aggregates, this method gives a direct measurement of the sizes of the aggregates and the size distributions of the primary particles of which they are composed. The current version of the algorithm allows processing of high-resolution TEM images by a conventional laptop computer at a rate of 1-2 ms per aggregate. The results were validated by comparison with manual image processing, and excellent agreement was found."

Biological samples are spatially, morphologically, and metabolically complex. Multimodal molecular imaging is an emerging approach that is capable of dealing with this complexity. In a multimodal approach, different imaging modalities can provide precise information about the local molecular composition of the surfaces. Images obtained by MSI can be coregistered with images obtained by other molecular imaging techniques such as microscopic images of fluorescent protein expression or histologically stained sections. In order to properly coregister images from different modalities, each tissue section must contain points of reference, which are visible in all data sets. Here, we report a newly developed coregistration technique using fiducial markers such as cresyl violet, Ponceau S, and bromophenol blue that possess a combination of optical and molecular properties that result in a clear mass spectrometric signature. We describe these fiducial markers and demonstrate an application that allows accurate coregistration and 3-dimensional reconstruction of serial histological and fluorescent microscopic images with MSI images of thin tissue sections from a breast tumor model."

METHODS: A high-resolution microendoscope (HRME) was used to image intact, resected oral squamous carcinoma specimens. HRME images were reviewed and classified as non-neoplastic or neoplastic by expert clinicians. An algorithm based on quantitative morphologic features was also used to classify each image. Results were compared to the histopathologic diagnosis. RESULTS: HRME images were obtained from 141 sites in resected specimens from 13 patients. Subjective image interpretation yielded sensitivity and specificity of 85% to 90% and 80% to 85%, respectively, whereas the objective classification algorithm achieved sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 77%, respectively. CONCLUSION: High-resolution microendoscopy of intact oral mucosa can provide images with sufficient detail to classify oral lesions by both subjective image interpretation and objective image analysis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Woowa (polymer coating; Dany Harvest) and BioForce High Aesthetic Archwire (metal coating; Dentsply GAC) with cross-section dimensions of 0.016 x 0.022 inches were selected. Noncoated posterior regions of the anterior-coated Woowa and uncoated Sentalloy were used for comparison. Nominal coating compositions were determined by x-ray fluorescence (JSX-3200, JOEL). Cross-sectioned and external surfaces were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM; SSX-550, Shimadzu) and an atomic force microscope (SPM-9500J2, Shimadzu). A three-point bending test (12-mm span) was carried out using a universal testing machine (EZ Test, Shimadzu). Hardness and elastic modulus of external and cross-sectioned surfaces were obtained by nanoindentation (ENT-1100a, Elionix; n  =  10). RESULTS: Coatings on Woowa and BioForce High Aesthetic Archwire contained 41% silver and 14% gold, respectively. The coating thickness on Woowa was approximately 10 microm, and the coating thickness on BioForce High Aesthetic Archwire was much smaller. The surfaces of both coated wires were rougher than the noncoated wires. Woowa showed a higher mean unloading force than the noncoated Woowa, although BioForce High Aesthetic Archwire showed a lower mean unloading force than Sentalloy. While cross-sectional surfaces of all wires had similar hardness and elastic modulus, values for the external surface of Woowa were smaller than for the other wires. CONCLUSIONS: The coating processes for Woowa and BioForce High Aesthetic Archwire influence bending behavior and surface morphology."

Here we present a detailed retrospective clinical, neuroimaging and histopathological analysis of a C9ORF72 mutation case series in relation to other forms of genetically determined frontotemporal lobar degeneration ascertained at a specialist centre. Eighteen probands (19 cases in total) were identified, representing 35% of frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases with identified mutations, 36% of cases with clinical evidence of motor neuron disease and 7% of the entire cohort. Thirty-three per cent of these C9ORF72 cases had no identified relevant family history. Families showed wide variation in clinical onset (43-68 years) and duration (1.7-22 years). The most common presenting syndrome (comprising a half of cases) was behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, however, there was substantial clinical heterogeneity across the C9ORF72 mutation cohort. Sixty per cent of cases developed clinical features consistent with motor neuron disease during the period of follow-up. Anxiety and agitation and memory impairment were prominent features (between a half to two-thirds of cases), and dominant parietal dysfunction was also frequent. Affected individuals showed variable magnetic resonance imaging findings; however, relative to healthy controls, the group as a whole showed extensive thinning of frontal, temporal and parietal cortices, subcortical grey matter atrophy including thalamus and cerebellum and involvement of long intrahemispheric, commissural and corticospinal tracts. The neuroimaging profile of the C9ORF72 expansion was significantly more symmetrical than progranulin mutations with significantly less temporal lobe involvement than microtubule-associated protein tau mutations. Neuropathological examination in six cases with C9ORF72 mutation from the frontotemporal lobar degeneration series identified histomorphological features consistent with either type A or B TAR DNA-binding protein-43 deposition; however, p62-positive (in excess of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive) neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in hippocampus and cerebellum were a consistent feature of these cases, in contrast to the similar frequency of p62 and TAR DNA-binding protein-43 deposition in 53 control cases with frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TAR DNA-binding protein. These findings corroborate the clinical importance of the C9ORF72 mutation in frontotemporal lobar degeneration, delineate phenotypic and neuropathological features that could help to guide genetic testing, and suggest hypotheses for elucidating the neurobiology of a culprit subcortical network."

In terms of accuracy, results have shown an overall high performance by most of the methods. However, we included in the evaluation study other criteria such as computational cost and focusing curve shape which are crucial for real-time applications and were used to highlight the best practices."

The proposed scheme is composed of collagen fibres segmentation, its textural feature extraction and selection, screening perfomance enhancement under Gaussian transformation and finally classification. In this study, collagen fibres are segmented on R,G,B color channels using back-probagation neural network from 60 normal and 59 OSF histological images followed by histogram specification for reducing the stain intensity variation. Henceforth, textural features of collgen area are extracted using fractal approaches viz., differential box counting and brownian motion curve . Feature selection is done using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence criterion and the screening performance is evaluated based on various statistical tests to conform Gaussian nature. Here, the screening performance is enhanced under Gaussian transformation of the non-Gaussian features using hybrid distribution. Moreover, the routine screening is designed based on two statistical classifiers viz., Bayesian classification and support vector machines (SVM) to classify normal and OSF. It is observed that SVM with linear kernel function provides better classification accuracy (91.64%) as compared to Bayesian classifier. The addition of fractal features of collagen under Gaussian transformation improves Bayesian classifier's performance from 80.69% to 90.75%. Results are here studied and discussed."

About the research data set, DCE-MRIs of 132 solid breast masses with definite histopathologic diagnosis (63 benign and 69 malignant) were used in this study. At first, the tumor region was automatically segmented using the region growing method based on the integrated color map formed by the combination of kinetic and area under curve color map. Then, the FCM clustering was used to identify the time-signal curve with the larger initial enhancement inside the segmented region as the representative kinetic curve, and then the parameters of the Tofts pharmacokinetic model for the representative kinetic curve were compared with conventional curve analysis (maximal enhancement, time to peak, uptake rate and washout rate) for each mass. The results were analyzed with a receiver operating characteristic curve and Student's t test to evaluate the classification performance. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the combined model-based parameters of the extracted kinetic curve from FCM clustering were 86.36% (114/132), 85.51% (59/69), 87.30% (55/63), 88.06% (59/67) and 84.62% (55/65), better than those from a conventional curve analysis. The A(Z) value was 0.9154 for Tofts model-based parametric features, better than that for conventional curve analysis (0.8673), for discriminating malignant and benign lesions. In conclusion, model-based analysis of the characteristic kinetic curve of breast mass derived from FCM clustering provides effective lesion classification. This approach has potential in the development of a CAD system for DCE breast MRI."

However, denervation of the sphincter potentially affects anal function after rectal surgery for cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the location and type (nitrergic, adrenergic, and cholinergic) of nerve fibers in the internal anal sphincter and to provide a 3-dimensional representation of their structural relationship in the human fetus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: serial transverse sections were obtained from 14 human fetuses (7 male, 7 female, 15-31 weeks of gestation) and were studied histologically and immunohistochemically; digitized serial sections were used to construct a 3-dimensional representation of the pelvis. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The location and type of internal anal sphincter nerves were assessed qualitatively. RESULTS: Posteroinferior fibers originating from the inferior hypogastric plexus posteroinferior angle projected to the posterolateral and posterior rectal wall and internal anal sphincter, forming the inferior rectal plexus. The inferior rectal plexus contained vesicular acetylcholine transporter-positive (cholinergic), tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (adrenergic/sympathetic), and neural nitric oxide synthase-positive (nitrergic) fibers. The intrasphincteric vesicular acetylcholine transporter-positive fibers included both neural nitric oxide synthase-negative fibers and neural nitric oxide synthase-positive fibers (nitrergic-parasympathetic). LIMITATIONS: The study focused on topographic and functional anatomy, so that quantitative data were not obtained. A small number of fetal specimens were available. CONCLUSIONS: We report the precise location and distribution of the autonomic neural supply to the internal anal sphincter. This description contributes to the understanding of neurogenic postoperative sphincteric dysfunction. Three-dimensional cartography of pelvic-perineal neurotransmitters provides an anatomical and physiological basis for the selection and development of pharmacological agents to be used in the treatment of primary or postoperative continence and evacuation disorders."

As part of this process, routine diagnostics of breast tumours includes histological typing and grading, as well as profiling by use of an immunohistochemistry panel of antibodies, probes and in situ hybridization. This will, as a minimum, include assessment of oestrogen receptor (OR) and HER2. The individual preparation and staining of many breast tumours in a large laboratory with this standard panel is thus time consuming and costly. Herein, we show that in breast cancer routine diagnostics the use of the tissue microarray technique in combination with digitalization of the stained multi-slides is not only economical, with a considerable cost reduction, but it also enhances standardization of tumour profiling. We demonstrate that 2 mm breast tumour cores correlate with the corresponding tumour on whole mount slides, regarding staining/hybridizing results with the biomarkers in our panel consisting of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, OR and Topiomerase IIa. Furthermore, we show that simultaneous staining/hybridizing of multiple breast tumour specimens reduces variation of staining/hybridizing quality, hereby increasing reliability of interpretation. By scanning and digitalization of the stained and hybridized multi-slides, we could optimize documentation and filing of the results. Our work is an example of translational research by implementing a tool in daily diagnostics originally developed for high throughput analyses in the search for prognostic and predictive markers in targeted medicine."

METHODS: One trained examiner assessed 105 occlusal surfaces by using the LF device, LF pen, FC, International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) criteria and bitewing (BW) radiographic methods. After tooth extraction, the authors assessed the teeth histologically. They determined the optimal clinical cutoffs by means of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: The specificities and sensitivities for enamel and dentin caries detection versus only dentin caries detection thresholds were 0.60 and 0.93 and 0.77 and 0.52 (ICDAS), 1.00 and 0.29 and 0.97 and 0.44 (BW radiography), 1.00 and 0.85 and 0.77 and 0.81 (LF device), 0.80 and 0.89 and 0.71 and 0.85 (LF pen) and 0.80 and 0.74 and 0.49 and 0.85 (FC), respectively. The accuracy values were higher for ICDAS, the LF device and the LF pen than they were for BW radiography and the FC. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical cutoffs for sound teeth, enamel carious lesions and dentin carious lesions were, respectively, 0 through 4, 5 through 27 and 28 through 99 (LF device); 0 through 4, 5 through 32 and 33 through 99 (LF pen); and 0 through 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 through 5.0 (FC). The ICDAS, the LF device and the LF pen demonstrated good performance in helping detect occlusal caries in vivo. The ICDAS did not seem to perform as well at the D(3) threshold (histologic scores 3 and 4) as at the D(1) threshold (histologic scores 1-4). BW radiography and the FC had the lowest performances in helping detect lesions at the D(1) and D(3) thresholds, respectively. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Occlusal caries detection should be based primarily on visual inspection. Fluorescence-based methods may be used to provide a second opinion in clinical practice."

This work describes a new application of the CLSM technique. The system used was the OLS3100-USS, LEXT model (Olympus(R)). CLSM was used for the surface analysis of the extraction site. The measurements taken with CLSM were: (1) mesio-distal distance, (2) alveolar ridge thickness, and (3) vestibular and lingual alveolar ridge height. Results of study cast scanning at baseline, 1 and 3 months after tooth extraction, with CLSM are well-detailed images of postextraction areas. The CLSM technique used in study casts is a valid method to measure the dimensional changes that happen in the edentulous area after tooth extraction. This technique allows the evaluation of changes in mesio-distal distance, thickness of the alveolar ridge and alveolar ridge height based on the measurements on the alveolar contours."

On H&E stains, the most discriminatory features between LRN, HGDN and HCC were volume fraction and the number of hepatocyte nuclei in unit volume and hepatocyte nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. On immunohistochemistry, volume fractions of capillarised sinusoids, capillary units and isolated arteries were significantly different among all groups and highest in HCC; surface fraction of reticulin was markedly decreased in HCC. Our morphometric model is an objective method for quantification of the morphological changes of the nodular lesions, and it could be applied to studies involving histological evaluation of the spectrum of nodular lesions arising in the cirrhotic liver."

METHODS: Viable human ex vivo explants of the anterior chamber angle containing the aqueous humor drainage tissue in situ were imaged by TPEF to localize AF and Hoechst 33342 nuclear fluorescence. An autofluorescent marker in Schlemm's Canal (SC) aided SC situ visualization. En face and orthogonal views of the TM were generated. RESULTS: In the innermost uveal TM, AF signals outlined an intricate 3-D network of fine branching beams with large openings between the beams. In the adjacent corneoscleral TM, beams were thicker and coalesced as plate-like structures with pore-like openings. Linear and coiled AF fibers were visible on the background AF of beams. Deeper, in the external TM, this organization changed to fine fiber arrays orientated in the tissue's longitudinal axis, reminiscent of the cribriform plexus of the juxtacanalicular TM (JCT). In the outermost JCT, AF of fine fibers was sparse, then undetectable as optical sections approached the inner wall of SC. Cell nuclei were closely associated with the TM structural extracellular matrix. CONCLUSIONS: We have used TPEF and optical sectioning to exploit AF as a useful method to visualize the structure of the human conventional aqueous drainage pathway in situ. Ancillary nuclear staining allowed cell association with the AF structures to be seen. This approach revealed a unique 3-D perspective of the TM that is consistent with known TM structural characteristics."

A typical montage contains several hundred images to be quality checked and manually arranged. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate software for off-line montaging of IVCM images of the living human cornea. METHODS: The software was developed and tested using four large data sets of IVCM images from normal human corneas. Two of the data sets were used for calibration purposes, the remaining images served as a validation set. Techniques utilized included image binarization, clustering, key-point generation, and feature-based stitching. A range of tests involving computer processing and visual inspection were applied to audit and compare the automated montages with manually constructed montages. RESULTS: The original IVCM images (N = 2565) from four corneas were processed into image groups, reducing the number of effective images by 68% to 86%. Each data set contained a large primary grouping. A clustering strategy was used to reduce the total potential workload by 57%. Both programmatic and visual inspection confirmed the method was robust to errors, with a specificity of 100% (i.e., no falsely matched images). The time taken to complete the montage varied from 1.5 to 3 hours.

Epub 2011 Aug 3.,Mourtada F,Brachytherapy,2012,2011/08/06,,,10.1016/j.brachy.2011.06.002,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the dosimetric parameters of the AgX100, a new (125)I brachytherapy seed model, using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations according to the protocol specified by the updated American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group No. 43 Report (TG-43U1) and compare these parameters with those of the established brachytherapy (125)I seed models 6711 and I25.S06. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Independent verification of the new seed geometry was performed using high-resolution digital radiography and scanning electron microscopy. MCNPX v.2.5 MC simulations of the AgX100 seed were performed to derive its TG-43U1 parameters, the dose rate constant, the radial dose function, and the two- and one-dimensional anisotropy functions in liquid water. A dosimetric error propagation analysis was also performed to include uncertainty because of seed manufacturing tolerances and physics parameters. RESULTS: The MC-calculated dose rate constant for the AgX100 seed was 0.943cGy.h(-1).U(-1)+/-2.6% (k=1) based on the air kerma strength for a simulated point detector. Tabulated results of the radial dose function for line and point source approximations and the two-dimensional anisotropy function are also reported. CONCLUSIONS: The MC-predicted dose distribution of the AgX100 seed was found to be comparable with that of the model 6711 seed but much different from the dose distribution of the model I25.S06 seeds. However, at shallow distances, there were some dosimetric differences between the AgX100 and 6711 seed, which warrant separate TG-43U1 parameters for use in clinical treatment planning systems."

Epub 2011 Sep 6.,Wu X,Scanning,2012,2011/09/08,,,10.1002/sca.20285,"Assessment of skin lymphatic vessels is of great significance in understanding their roles in many pathological conditions. Our aim was to identify the optimal approach for investigation of cutaneous lymphatic system. We performed comparative studies on skin lymphatic vessels using immunohistochemistry of tissue sections, computer graphic reconstruction method together with immunohistochemically stained serial sections and whole mount fluorescence in human lower limb. Lymphatic vessels were identified with podoplanin antibody. The relative merits and drawbacks of each method in evaluation of structure, spatial organization, and distribution of cutaneous lymphatic vessels were described. Immunohistology of tissue sections enabled the investigation of the structure and distribution of the whole cutaneous lymphatic system in two-dimensional slices, whereas three-dimensional morphology of only the most superficial lymph capillary network immediately under the epidermis could be evaluated with the whole mount technique. Meanwhile, only little segmentation of skin lymphatic vessel from five immunohistochemically stained serial sections was reconstructed and evaluated due to expense and special skills required using computer graphic three-dimensional reconstruction. Furthermore, a great number of artifacts and special skills required in its processes leaded to less accurate structure of skin lymphatic vessels. Our findings demonstrated that the use of either of the proposed techniques alone could not allow a comprehensive analysis of the skin lymphatic system due to their relative drawbacks. Combination of immunohistology of tissue sections and three-dimensional whole-mount preparations appears to be the best candidate for comprehensive evaluation of skin lymphatic system."

The purpose of this study is to present a technique for quantifying the number of random central corneal images required to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy in the measurement of corneal nerve fiber length and branch density. METHODS: Every possible combination of 2 to 16 images (where 16 was deemed the true mean) of the central corneal subbasal nerve plexus, not overlapping by more than 20%, were assessed for nerve fiber length and branch density in 20 subjects with type 2 diabetes and varying degrees of functional nerve deficit. Mean ratios were calculated to allow comparisons between and within subjects. RESULTS: In assessing nerve branch density, eight randomly chosen images not overlapping by more than 20% produced an average that was within 30% of the true mean 95% of the time. A similar sampling strategy of five images was 13% within the true mean 80% of the time for corneal nerve fiber length. CONCLUSIONS: The ""sample combination analysis"" presented here can be used to determine the sample size required for a desired level of accuracy of quantification of corneal subbasal nerve parameters. This technique may have applications in other biological sampling studies."

Epub 2012 Mar 16.,Loeffler M,J Urol,2012,2012/03/20,,,10.1016/j.juro.2011.12.054,"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer is routinely graded according to the Gleason grading scheme. This scheme is predominantly based on the textural appearance of aberrant glandular structures. Gleason grade is difficult to standardize and often leads to discussion due to interrater and intrarater disagreement. Thus, we investigated whether digital image based automated quantitative histomorphometry could be used to achieve a more standardized, reproducible classification outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a proof of principle study we developed a method to evaluate digitized histological images of single prostate cancer regions in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. Preprocessed color images were subjected to color deconvolution, followed by the binarization of obtained hematoxylin related image channels. Highlighted neoplastic epithelial gland related objects were morphometrically assessed by a classifier based on 2 calculated quantitative and objective geometric measures, that is inverse solidity and inverse compactness. The procedure was then applied to the prostate cancer probes of 125 patients. Each probe was independently classified for Gleason grade 3, 4 or 5 by an experienced pathologist blinded to image analysis outcome. RESULTS: Together inverse compactness and inverse solidity were adequate discriminatory features for a powerful classifier that distinguished Gleason grade 3 from grade 4/5 histology. The classifier was robust on sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that quantitative and interpretable measures can be obtained from image based analysis, permitting algorithmic differentiation of prostate Gleason grades. The method must be validated in a large independent series of specimens."

Prior analyses, however, have focused on estimating mean fractional anisotropy (FA) within two large pre-defined callosal tracts only. Additional effects might exist in other, non-explored callosal regions and/or with respect to callosal attributes not captured by estimates of FA. To further explore callosal features in the framework of meditation, we analyzed 30 meditators and 30 controls, carefully matched for sex, age, and handedness. We applied a multimodal imaging approach using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in combination with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Callosal measures of tract-specific FA were complemented with other global (segment-specific) estimates as well as extremely local (point-wise) measures of callosal micro- and macro-structure. Callosal measures were larger in long-term meditators compared to controls, particularly in anterior callosal sections. However, differences achieved significance only when increasing the regional sensitivity of the measurement (i.e., using point-wise measures versus segment-specific measures) and were more prominent for microscopic than macroscopic characteristics (i.e., callosal FA versus callosal thickness). Thicker callosal regions and enhanced FA in meditators might indicate greater connectivity, possibly reflecting increased hemispheric integration during cerebral processes involving (pre)frontal regions. Such a brain organization might be linked to achieving characteristic mental states and skills as associated with meditation, though this hypothesis requires behavioral confirmation. Moreover, longitudinal studies are required to address whether the observed callosal effects are induced by meditation or constitute an innate prerequisite for the start or successful continuation of meditation."

Fluorescent markers attached to proteins/intracellular structures of interest in conjunction with 3D fluorescent microscopy are frequently exploited for functional analysis. Despite the central role of morphology comparisons in cell biological approaches, few statistical tools are available that allow biological scientists without a high level of statistical training to quantify the similarity or difference of fluorescent images containing multifactorial information. We transform intracellular structures into kernels and develop a multivariate two-sample test that is nonparametric and asymptotically normal to directly and quantitatively compare cellular morphologies. The asymptotic normality bypasses the computationally intensive calculations used by the usual resampling techniques to compute the P-value. Because all parameters required for the statistical test are estimated directly from the data, it does not require any subjective decisions. Thus, we provide a black-box method for unbiased, automated comparison of cell morphology. We validate the performance of our test statistic for finite synthetic samples and experimental data. Employing our test for the comparison of the morphology of intracellular multivesicular bodies, we detect changes in their distribution after disruption of the cellular microtubule cytoskeleton with high statistical significance in fixed samples and live cell analysis. These results demonstrate that density-based comparison of multivariate image information is a powerful tool for automated detection of cell morphology changes. Moreover, the underlying mathematics of our test statistic is a general technique, which can be applied in situations where two data samples are compared."

For all biological activity, the basal cells of the surface epithelium form the proliferative compartment and therefore their morphometric changes will spell the intricate biological behavior pertaining to normal cellular functions as well as in premalignant and malignant status. In view of this, the changes in shape, size and intensity of staining of the nuclei in the basal cell layer of the NOM and OSFD have been studied. Geometric, Zernike moments and Fourier descriptor (FD) based as well as intensity based features are extracted for histomorphometric pattern analysis of the nuclei. All these features are statistically analyzed along with 3D visualization in order to discriminate the groups. Results showed increase in the dimensions (area and perimeter), shape parameters and decreasing mean nuclei intensity of the nuclei in OSFD in respect to NOM. Further, the selected features are fed to the Bayesian classifier to discriminate normal and OSFD. The morphometric and intensity features provide a good sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 98.53% and positive predicative accuracy of 97.35%. This comparative quantitative characterization of basal cell nuclei will be of immense help for oral onco-pathologists, researchers and clinicians to assess the biological behavior of OSFD, specially relating to their premalignant and malignant potentiality. As a future direction more extensive study involving more number of disease subjects is observed."

Epub 2012 Jan 26.,Rosenkrantz AB,J Magn Reson Imaging,2012,2012/01/28,,,10.1002/jmri.23590,"PURPOSE: To assess the utility of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values obtained from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in distinguishing high-grade bladder cancer with and without metastatic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with histologically confirmed high-grade bladder cancer who underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5T including DWI using b-values of 0, 400, and 800 sec/mm(2) were assessed. Histologic findings and follow-up imaging were used to establish the reference standard in terms of metastatic disease. Two radiologists independently recorded ADC of all lesions following a training session, with their results averaged. Mann-Whitney U-test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Metastatic disease was characterized as present or absent in eight and nine patients, respectively. ADC was significantly lower among cases with metastatic disease than among cases without metastatic disease, both within the entire cohort (1.07 +/- 0.18 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs. 1.45 +/- 0.22 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s; P = 0.002) and within the subset of patients with muscle-invasive tumor (1.06 +/- 0.19 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs. 1.45 +/- 0.23 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s; P = 0.017). Area under the ROC curve for identifying metastatic disease using ADC was 0.944, with optimal threshold of 1.21 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, which was associated with a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 90.0%. Interreader agreement for ADC was excellent (ICC = 0.91). CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, ADC was significantly different between cases of high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with and without metastatic disease. These results may have value in assessing the metastatic potential of patients with localized high-grade tumors of the bladder."

Epub 2012 Mar 23.,Simsek AC,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,2012,2012/04/07,,,10.1109/TBME.2012.2191784,"This paper presents a new approach for unsupervised segmentation of histopathological tissue images. This approach has two main contributions. First, it introduces a new set of high-level texture features to represent the prior knowledge of spatial organization of the tissue components. These texture features are defined on the tissue components, which are approximately represented by tissue objects, and quantify the frequency of two component types being cooccurred in a particular spatial relationship. As they are defined on components, rather than on image pixels, these object cooccurrence features are expected to be less vulnerable to noise and variations that are typically observed at the pixel level of tissue images. Second, it proposes to obtain multiple segmentations by multilevel partitioning of a graph constructed on the tissue objects and combine them by an ensemble function. This multilevel graph partitioning algorithm introduces randomization in graph construction and refinements in its multilevel scheme to increase diversity of individual segmentations, and thus, improve the final result. The experiments on 200 colon tissue images reveal that the proposed approach--the object cooccurrence features together with the multilevel segmentation algorithm--is effective to obtain high-quality results. The experiments also show that it improves the segmentation results compared to the previous approaches."

METHODS: Eighteen patients with intractable MTLE/HS and 30 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. All of the patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MTLE/HS and underwent anteromedial temporal resection. VBM without a modulation step was applied to the magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain. Statistical parametric maps were used to compare structural characteristics such as gray matter concentration (GMC) within the temporal pole among patients and controls separately. The acquired data were then statistically analyzed to determine the congruency between visually inspected MR imaging (MRI) scans and VBM results in the detection of morphologic abnormalities in the temporal pole compared to postoperative histopathologic findings of cortical dysplasia. KEY FINDINGS: Histopathologic examination revealed cortical dysplasia within the temporal pole in 11 patients. In detail, according to Palmini's classification, mild malformations of cortical development (mMCDs) were disclosed in three patients, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type Ia in three patients, and FCD type Ib in five patients. Some type of structural temporal pole abnormality was suggested by VBM in 14 patients and by visually inspected MRI scans in 11 patients. The results of VBM were in agreement with the presence/absence of cortical dysplasia in 13 patients (72.2%); this correspondence was significant (p = 0.047). In one case, VBM was false negative and in four cases it was false positive. There was congruence between the results of visual analysis and histologic proof in 55.6% of examined patients, which was not significant. SIGNIFICANCE: We found that VBM made a superior contribution to the detection of temporopolar structural malformations (cortical dysplasia) compared to visual inspection. The agreement with postoperative histopathologic proof was clearly significant for VBM results and nonsignificant for visual inspection."

Qualitative differences in morphologic features and quantitative measurement of pathological lung tissues at different time points are characterized. We find that combined with morphological features, the quantitative parameters, such as the intensity ratio of MAF and SHG between pathological tissue and normal tissue and the MAF to SHG index versus depth clearly shows the tissue physiological changes during the process of pulmonary melanoma metastasis.

Fluorescence microscopy approaches to determine localization distribution have proved to be an essential tool in the characterization of unknown proteins, and are now particularly pertinent as a result of the wide availability of fluorescently-tagged constructs and antibodies. However, there are currently very few image analysis options able to effectively discriminate proteins with apparently similar distributions in cells, despite this information being important for protein characterization. FINDINGS: We have developed a novel method for combining two existing image analysis approaches, which results in highly efficient and accurate discrimination of proteins with seemingly similar distributions. We have combined image texture-based analysis with quantitative co-localization coefficients, a method that has traditionally only been used to study the spatial overlap between two populations of molecules. Here we describe and present a novel application for quantitative co-localization, as applied to the study of Rab family small GTP binding proteins localizing to the endomembrane system of cultured cells. CONCLUSIONS: We show how quantitative co-localization can be used alongside texture feature analysis, resulting in improved clustering of microscopy images. The use of co-localization as an additional clustering parameter is non-biased and highly applicable to high-throughput image data sets."

The subcellular pattern of a protein is typically represented as the set of cellular components in which it is located, and an important task is to determine this set from microscope images. In this article, we address this classification problem using confocal immunofluorescence images from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project. The HPA contains images of cells stained for many proteins; each is also stained for three reference components, but there are many other components that are invisible. Given one such cell, the task is to classify the pattern type of the stained protein. We first randomly select local image regions within the cells, and then extract various carefully designed features from these regions. This region-based approach enables us to explicitly study the relationship between proteins and different cell components, as well as the interactions between these components. To achieve these two goals, we propose two discriminative models that extend logistic regression with structured latent variables. The first model allows the same protein pattern class to be expressed differently according to the underlying components in different regions. The second model further captures the spatial dependencies between the components within the same cell so that we can better infer these components. To learn these models, we propose a fast approximate algorithm for inference, and then use gradient-based methods to maximize the data likelihood. RESULTS: In the experiments, we show that the proposed models help improve the classification accuracies on synthetic data and real cellular images. The best overall accuracy we report in this article for classifying 942 proteins into 13 classes of patterns is about 84.6%, which to our knowledge is the best so far. In addition, the dependencies learned are consistent with prior knowledge of cell organization. AVAILABILITY: http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software/."

Epub 2012 Mar 23.,Deb P,Microvasc Res,2012,2012/04/03,,,10.1016/j.mvr.2012.03.004,"INTRODUCTION: Alterations of microvasculature are integral to CNS neoplasia, and a diagnostic feature of high-grade gliomas. The objectives of this study were two fold: First, to correlate morphometrically measured microvessel density (MVD), microvessel caliber (VC), and percentage of total microvessel area (%TVA) with WHO histologic grade in various types of primary CNS tumors. Second, to evaluate if such a correlation could be further refined by using mathematical derivatives of measured parameters namely coefficient of variation of VC (COofVC), microvessel cross-sectional area (VCSA), and percentage of total VCSA (%TVCSA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various microvessel parameters were assessed in a variety of 30 primary CNS tumors as consecutively encountered in routine surgical pathology practice including gliomas, meningiomas and others by image morphometry using CD34-immunostained sections. We introduced a novel method of effectively determining VC. Results were correlated with tumor type and grade. Appropriate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Microvessel characteristics, especially VC (p<0.0022), VCSA (p<0.0164), CVofVC (p<0.0001), %TVCSA (p<0.0002) and %TVA (p<0.0003) of tumors were significantly greater than normal tissue. MVD increased in all tumors, excepting meningiomas, and was significantly higher in gliomas (p<0.0062). MVD showed negative correlation with VC (r=-0.808) and VCSA (r=-0.848) in the normal brain but was less significant in tumors. Unlike tumors, caliber distribution of microvessels in normal brain was noted to follow a Gaussian pattern. Histological grades of tumors showed positive correlation with MVD (r=0.547), VC (r=0.606), CVofVC (r=0.623), VCSA (r=0.485), %TVCSA (r=0.783) and %TVA (r=0.603). Calculated scores, estimated from multiple regressions of vessel parameters, correlated well with histological grade, with S2 (calculated using all measured as well as mathematically derived microvessel parameters) being better than S1 (calculated using measured parameters: MVD and VC). CONCLUSION: Tumor grades positively correlated with all microvessel parameters, with %TVCSA displaying the best. The correlation of %TVA with tumor grade was weaker than %TVCSA mainly due to the impact of MVD. These findings emphasize the value of VC as effectively measured using our novel method and best illustrated by its derivative %TVCSA (an indicator of blood flow), in addition to the well-recognized value of MVD in tumor prognostication. Multiple regressions of microvessel parameters provided the best correlation with grade. Morphometric analysis of microvessels in CNS tumor facilitates a better understanding of the tumor grade, tumor progression and overall prognosis."

Subsequently, histological assessment was undertaken in all specimens to correlate the observations of T2* mapping with histological analyses. According to the Mankin score, four grades of histological changes were determined: grade 0 (Mankin scores of 0-4), grade I (scores of 5-8), grade II (scores of 9-10), and grade III (scores of 11-14). For reliability assessment, cartilage T2* measurements were repeated after 4 weeks in 10 randomly selected femoral head specimens. RESULTS: T2* values decreased significantly with increasing cartilage degeneration (total P-values <0.001) ranging from 36.3 +/- 4.3 ms in grade 0 regions to 22.8 +/- 4.3 ms in regions with grade III changes. Pearson correlation analysis proved a fair correlation between T2* values and Mankin score (correlation coefficient = -0.362) that was statistically significant (P-value <0.001). Intra-class correlation (ICC) analysis demonstrated high intra-observer reproducibility for the T2* measurement (ICC: 0.949, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Given the advantages of the T2* mapping technique with no need for contrast medium, high image resolution and ability to perform 3D biochemically sensitive imaging, T2* mapping may be a strong addition to the currently evolving era of cartilage biochemical imaging."
22498689,"An integrated region-, boundary-, shape-based active contour for multiple object overlap resolution in histological imagery","Ali S, Madabhushi A.",IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2012 Jul;31(7):1448-60. doi: 10.1109/TMI.2012.2190089. Epub 2012 Apr 5.,Ali S,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2012,2012/04/14,,,10.1109/TMI.2012.2190089,"Active contours and active shape models (ASM) have been widely employed in image segmentation. A major limitation of active contours, however, is in their 1) inability to resolve boundaries of intersecting objects and to 2) handle occlusion. Multiple overlapping objects are typically segmented out as a single object. On the other hand, ASMs are limited by point correspondence issues since object landmarks need to be identified across multiple objects for initial object alignment. ASMs are also are constrained in that they can usually only segment a single object in an image. In this paper, we present a novel synergistic boundary and region-based active contour model that incorporates shape priors in a level set formulation with automated initialization based on watershed. We demonstrate an application of these synergistic active contour models using multiple level sets to segment nuclear and glandular structures on digitized histopathology images of breast and prostate biopsy specimens. Unlike previous related approaches, our model is able to resolve object overlap and separate occluded boundaries of multiple objects simultaneously. The energy functional of the active contour is comprised of three terms. The first term is the prior shape term, modeled on the object of interest, thereby constraining the deformation achievable by the active contour. The second term, a boundary-based term detects object boundaries from image gradients. The third term drives the shape prior and the contour towards the object boundary based on region statistics. The results of qualitative and quantitative evaluation on 100 prostate and 14 breast cancer histology images for the task of detecting and segmenting nuclei and lymphocytes reveals that the model easily outperforms two state of the art segmentation schemes (geodesic active contour and Rousson shape-based model) and on average is able to resolve up to 91% of overlapping/occluded structures in the images."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (mean [SD] age, 30.8 [8.8] years) with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement and suspected cartilage damage (study group) and 35 healthy, asymptomatic volunteers (mean [SD] age, 24.9 [2.1] years) with no obvious history of hip diseases or abnormalities (control group) were included. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 T using a 3-dimensional (3D) double-echo steady-state sequence for grading cartilage morphologically and a 3D multiecho data image combination sequence for T2* assessment. Statistical assessment included the Student t test to reveal differences between mean T2* values of the study group and the control group. One-way analysis of variance was used to identify any statistically significant differences between the T2* values in various grades (modified Outerbridge score system) of cartilage damage within the study group. RESULTS: Significant differences were noted between the T2* values in the study group and the control group (P < 0.001). We also noted a significant drop in T2* in accordance with the morphologic damage in the study group (P < 0.001). The largest drop in T2* was found between morphologically normal-appearing cartilage (grade 0; T2*, 25.2 milliseconds) and grade I changes (T2*, 18.1 milliseconds) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In combination with a 3-T system, T2* mapping offers unique advantages such as high image resolution and the ability of 3D biochemically sensitive cartilage evaluation in the hip joint without the need for contrast medium. Given these advantages, we believe that T2* mapping is another welcome addition to the rapidly evolving era of hip cartilage biochemical imaging. Further studies are necessary that involve a diagnostic histological analysis as gold standard for comparison."

METHODS: Echo-planar diffusion weighted images (DWI) and standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were reviewed retrospectively in patients with PA (n=34) and PMA (n=8). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on ADC maps within tumor parts with lowest ADC values. Apparent diffusion coefficient values in tumor were normalized to those in cerebrospinal fluid (ADC/CSF). The ratio of T2 signal intensity in solid tumor parts to CSF (T2/CSF) was registered. Myxoid matrix was histologically quantified retrospectively in 8 PMAs and 17 PAs and correlated with imaging findings. RESULTS: Mean ADC/CSF for PA and PMA was 0.53+/-0.10 and 0.69+/-0.10 (p<0.01). Mean T2/CSF for PA and PMA was 0.78+/-0.19 and 0.93+/-0.09 (p<0.01). Mean proportion of myxoid tumor matrix in PA was 50% (range, 10-100%) and 93% (range, 90-100%) in PMA (p=0.004). Eight patients (32%; all PA) had less than 50% myxoid content and 17 (68%; 8 PA; 9 PMA) had more. There was positive correlation of ADC/CSF, T2/CSF and ADC (r2=0.61, 0.65 and 0.60 respectively) and significant difference between the groups with more and less than 50% myxoid content (p=0.01 for ADC/CSF and T2/CSF and p=0.02 for ADC). CONCLUSIONS: General imaging features of PA and PMA are non-specific, ADC values and T2 signal intensity are generally higher in the latter, reflecting the proportion of myxoid matrix in these tumors."

METHODS: Liver biopsies, blood testing, and real-time elastography were performed in 71 patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. The ratio of the elastic strain of liver tissue to that of muscle tissue was determined and correlated with the histologic fibrosis stages and laboratory examination results. RESULTS: There was a highly negative correlation between the elastic strain ratio and the histologic fibrosis stage (Spearman r = -0.702; P < .001). There was a high correlation observed between a decreasing elastic strain ratio and an increasing fibrosis stage. With substantial liver fibrosis (Scheuer score >/= S2) and cirrhosis (S4) as diagnostic criteria, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the elastic strain ratios were 0.863 and 0.797, respectively. The AUC for substantial fibrosis was higher than the AUC for the blood parameters used to diagnose substantial liver fibrosis. Elastic strain ratio cutoff values of 1.10 and 0.60 were identified as diagnostic of substantial fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively, with sensitivities of 77.8% and 50.0%, respectively, and specificities of 80.0% and 96.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time elastography is a new clinically promising and noninvasive method for quantitative assessment of liver fibrosis."

Morphological changes in the white blood cells can be an indicator of the nature and severity of the disease. Manual techniques are labor intensive, slow, error prone and costly. A computerized system can be used as a supportive tool for the specialist in order to enhance and accelerate the morphological analysis process. This research present a new method that integrates color features with the morphological reconstruction to localize and isolate lymphoblast cells from a microscope image that contains many cells. The localization and segmentation are conducted using a proposed method that consists of an integration of several digital image processing techniques. 180 microscopic blood images were tested, and the proposed framework managed to obtain 100% accuracy for the localization of the lymphoblast cells and separate it from the image scene. The results obtained indicate that the proposed method can be safely used for the purpose of lymphoblast cells localization and segmentation and subsequently, aiding the diagnosis of leukemia."

Interstitial cells have several subtypes based on site, morphology and differential expression of markers such as anti-vimentin and anti-KIT. We examined whether a subpopulation of interstitial cells immunopositive for PDGFRalpha exists in human and guinea pig bladders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human and guinea pig bladder tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry and examined by bright field or confocal microscopy. Whole mount tissues and paraffin sections were labeled with antibodies to PDGFRalpha, vimentin, KIT and PGP9.5. Protein expression was assessed by Western blot. RESULTS: PDGFRalpha(+) cells were present in human and guinea pig bladders. In the guinea pig PDGFRalpha(+) cells had a branched stellate morphology and formed networks in the lamina propria. In human and guinea pig detrusors PDGFRalpha(+) cells were elongated on the boundary of smooth muscle bundles or were seen as groups of stellate cells in the interbundle spaces. PDGFRalpha(+) cells were located close to nerves labeled by PGP9.5. Double labeling revealed that PDGFRalpha(+) cells were a subgroup of the vimentin(+) population. A significant proportion of PDGFRalpha(+) cells were also KIT(+). Bands corresponding to PDGFRalpha, KIT and vimentin proteins were detected on Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this study is the first to identify PDGFRalpha(+)/KIT(+) cells in the bladder lamina propria and detrusor layers. These cells are a subgroup of the vimentin(+) population, showing the complexity of bladder interstitial cells. PDGFRalpha(+) cells are apparently structurally associated with intramural nerves, indicating integration with bladder control mechanisms."

We also sought to categorize the appearance of brain tumor-related WM tract changes. METHODS: A total of 18 inpatients with intracranial neoplasms were enrolled. MRI examinations were performed at 3 T using an 8-channel phased array coil. DTT was reconstruction from the raw data of diffusion tensor imaging. WM tract-based analysis of the mean diffusivity (MD), eigenvalues (lambda(1) , lambda(2) , lambda(3) ), and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed by the manual placement of regions of interest (ROIs) on the color-coded FA maps using DTIStudio software. The axial diffusivity (DA, namely lambda(1) ) and the tensor shape (Cl, namely (lambda(1) -lambda(2) )/3 (lambda)) were also compared between groups. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In cases of low-grade glioma (LGG), the tracts adjacent to the tumors displayed the highest levels of invasion. Tract disruption was mainly observed in cases of high-grade glioma (HGG). We found significant differences regarding the FA, MD, DA, and radial diffusivity between ROIs in patients with LGG or HGG. There were also significant differences in DA and tensor shape (Cl) between patients with LGG and HGG. CONCLUSION: Axial diffusivity and Cl may be useful early markers for differentiating between LGG and HGG."

Such a graph is derived from a vectorized representation of anatomical data, provides a map of all vessels as vertices and segments, and may include the location of nonvascular components, such as neuronal and glial somata. Yet vectorized data sets typically contain erroneous gaps, spurious endpoints, and spuriously merged strands. Current methods to correct such defects only address the issue of connecting gaps and further require manual tuning of parameters in a high dimensional algorithm. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a supervised machine learning method that (1) connects vessel gaps by ""learned threshold relaxation""; (2) removes spurious segments by ""learning to eliminate deletion candidate strands""; and (3) enforces consistency in the joint space of learned vascular graph corrections through ""consistency learning."" Human operators are only required to label individual objects they recognize in a training set and are not burdened with tuning parameters. The supervised learning procedure examines the geometry and topology of features in the neighborhood of each vessel segment under consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on four sets of microvascular data, each with >800(3) voxels, obtained with all optical histology of mouse tissue and vectorization by state-of-the-art techniques in image segmentation. Through statistically validated sampling and analysis in terms of precision recall curves, we find that learning with bagged boosted decision trees reduces equal-error error rates for threshold relaxation by 5-21% and strand elimination performance by 18-57%. We benchmark generalization performance across datasets; while improvements vary between data sets, learning always leads to a useful reduction in error rates. Overall, learning is shown to more than halve the total error rate, and therefore, human time spent manually correcting such vectorizations."

Though nuclei of isolated cells in high-quality acquisitions often are easy to segment, the problem lies in the segmentation of large numbers of nuclei with various characteristics under differing acquisition conditions in high-resolution scans of the complete microscope slides. We implemented a system that enables processing of full resolution images, and proposes a new algorithm for segmenting the nuclei under adequate control of the expert user. The system can work automatically or interactively guided, to allow for segmentation within the whole range of slide and image characteristics. It facilitates data storage and interaction of technical and medical experts, especially with its web-based architecture. The proposed algorithm localizes cell nuclei using a voting scheme and prior knowledge, before it determines the exact shape of the nuclei by means of an elastic segmentation algorithm. After noise removal with a mean-shift and a median filtering takes place, edges are extracted with a Canny edge detection algorithm. Motivated by the observation that cell nuclei are surrounded by cytoplasm and their shape is roughly elliptical, edges adjacent to the background are removed. A randomized Hough transform for ellipses finds candidate nuclei, which are then processed by a level set algorithm. The algorithm is tested and compared to other algorithms on a database containing 207 images acquired from two different microscope slides, with promising results."

As in other biomedical imaging areas such as radiology, many computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems have been implemented to aid histopathologists and clinicians in cancer diagnosis and research, which have been attempted to significantly reduce the labor and subjectivity of traditional manual intervention with histology images. The task of automated histology image analysis is usually not simple due to the unique characteristics of histology imaging, including the variability in image preparation techniques, clinical interpretation protocols, and the complex structures and very large size of the images themselves. In this paper we discuss those characteristics, provide relevant background information about slide preparation and interpretation, and review the application of digital image processing techniques to the field of histology image analysis. In particular, emphasis is given to state-of-the-art image segmentation methods for feature extraction and disease classification. Four major carcinomas of cervix, prostate, breast, and lung are selected to illustrate the functions and capabilities of existing CAD systems."

The skin of the superior part of the upper lip region from human cadavers were fixed, processed using routine histological methods, serially sectioned at a thickness of 10 mum, and then stained with Masson's trichrome. The serial sections were reconstructed three-dimensionally using 'Reconstruct' software. The present study confirmed skeletal muscle fibers in this area, but they did not attach to the follicle of the human mustache. Although the follicle of the mustache was surrounded with some muscle fibers, they just ran obliquely to the skin surface from the deeper orbicularis oris muscle regardless of the follicle. There was no muscle associated with the human mustache. The voluntary or involuntary mobility of the human mustache has been lost evolutionally forever."

It constitutes less than 1 % of all intracranial tumors and approximately 2-4 % of all meningeal tumors. The authors present our institute's experience in combined modality management of 15 successive patients of HPC. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients of HPC treated in our institute from 2001 to 2011. Clinical characteristics and treatment modality, in the form of surgery and radiotherapy, were noted. Statistical analysis was done with regards to recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 40.0 years. Nine patients were males and six patients were females. The median duration of symptoms was six months. Headache was the most common presenting symptom followed by vomiting, motor weakness and seizures. Twelve patients underwent total excision while three had subtotal excision. Seven patients had WHO grade II histology tumors and eight patients had grade III histology. Thirteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Median RT dose delivered was 50 Gy. Five patients developed local recurrence. One patient had distant metastases. Median duration of RFS was 68 months. CONCLUSIONS: HPCs are aggressive tumors. The mainstay of therapy is gross total resection at the initial surgery. Postoperative adjuvant RT should be offered to all patients, regardless of the degree of resection achieved. Long-term follow-up is important as local recurrences and distant metastases can develop years after the initial treatment."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients with 83 HCCs (3 cm or less in diameter) were included in this study. All patients underwent 4-phase MDCT imaging and subsequent surgery within eight weeks. Two independent radiologists blinded to the histologic findings retrospectively classified the HCCs as either typical (showing increased enhancement on arterial phase images followed by washout in late phase images) or atypical lesions demonstrating any other enhancement pattern. From the original pathologic reports, various histologic characteristics including gross morphology, nuclear histologic grades, presence of capsule formation, and capsule infiltration when a capsule was present, were compared among the two groups. RESULTS: An atypical enhancement pattern was seen in 30 (36.2%) of the 83 HCCs. The mean size of atypical HCCs (1.71 +/- 0.764) was significantly smaller than that of typical HCCs (2.31 +/- 0.598, p < 0.001). Atypical HCCs were frequently found to be vaguely nodular in gross morphology (n = 13, 43.3%) and to have grade I nuclear grades (n = 17, 56.7%). Capsule formation was significantly more common in typical HCCs (p < 0.001). Capsular infiltration was also more common in typical HCCs (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: HCCs showing atypical dynamic enhancement on MDCT imaging are usually smaller than typical HCCs, vaguely nodular type in gross morphology in most cases, and well-differentiated in nuclear grades, and they lack of capsule formation or capsular infiltration."

AQP4 is expressed as a short isoform (M23) that forms large OAPs, and a long isoform (M1) that does not form OAPs by itself but can mingle with M23 to form relatively small OAPs. AQP4 OAPs were imaged with ~20 nm spatial precision by photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM) in cells expressing chimeras of M1- or M23-AQP4 with photoactivatable fluorescent proteins. Native AQP4 was imaged by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) using a primary anti-AQP4 antibody and fluorescent secondary antibodies. We found that OAP area increased from 1878+/-747 to 3647+/-958 nm(2) with decreasing M1:M23 ratio from 1:1 to 1:3, and became elongated. Two-color dSTORM indicated that M1 and M23 co-assemble in OAPs with a M1-enriched periphery surrounding a M23-enriched core. Native AQP4 in astrocytes formed OAPs with an area of 2142+/-829 nm(2), which increased to 5137+/-1119 nm(2) with 2-bromopalmitate. PALM of AQP4 OAPs in live cells showed slow diffusion (average ~10(-12) cm(2)/s) and reorganization. OAP area was not altered by anti-AQP4 IgG autoantibodies (NMO-IgG) that cause the neurological disease neuromyelitis optica. Super-resolution imaging allowed elucidation of novel nanoscale structural and dynamic features of OAPs."

Furthermore, the precise detection of the nerve fibres nature is not possible by means of dissection. The combination of immunohistochemistry and three-dimensional reconstruction could be used to resolve these limitations of morphological sciences. Our aim is to describe the evolution of computer-assisted anatomic dissection (CAAD), which is an original method applied to study the distribution of intra-pelvic nerves in anatomic research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serial transverse sectioning of the pelvic region in rabbit, human fetus, infant and adult cadaver was performed. Sections were immuno-histochemically stained and digitized with a high optical resolution scanner. Photoshop 7 software was used in regrouping of the adult cadaver sections then a tri-dimensional reconstruction was achieved using WinSurf software. RESULTS: The 3D reconstruction of the immuno-histochemically stained histologic sections of the pelvis allowed for precise structural identification of the prostate and its innervations (in fetus, infant and adult). In addition, we reconstructed the entire intra-pelvic organs with accurate demonstration of the location of both adrenergic and cholinergic pathways. Moreover, we performed a virtual dissection of each of the pelvic structures with description of the exact location of the inferior hypogastric plexus, as well as the nature and the distribution of its fibres. CONCLUSION: The CAAD is an original method in anatomic research, which illustrates the fact that descriptive anatomy is still a dynamic science. This method allows for a 3D presentation of the intra-organic innervation, the nature of the nerve fibres, and the distribution of receptors and their neurotransmitters. This technique improves the understanding of the complex anatomic regions such as the pelvis from both surgical and educational point of view."

PROCEDURES: Green fluorescent protein-labeled, human glioma LN-229 cells were implanted into mouse brain. At 20-38 days, cryo-imaging gave whole brain, 4-GB, 3D microscopic images of bright field anatomy, including vasculature, and fluorescent tumor. Image analysis/visualization methods were developed. RESULTS: Vessel visualization and segmentation methods successfully enabled analyses. The main tumor mass volume, the number of dispersed clusters, the number of cells/cluster, and the percent dispersed volume all increase with age of the tumor. Histograms of dispersal distance give a mean and median of 63 and 56 mum, respectively, averaged over all brains. Dispersal distance tends to increase with age of the tumors. Dispersal tends to occur along blood vessels. Blood vessel density did not appear to increase in and around the tumor with this cell line. CONCLUSION: Cryo-imaging and software allow, for the first time, 3D, whole brain, microscopic characterization of a tumor from a particular cell line. LN-229 exhibits considerable dispersal along blood vessels, a characteristic of human tumors that limits treatment success."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics approval for the study was granted. Women recalled for assessment following routine screening with screen-film mammography were invited to participate. Participants underwent bilateral, two-view FFDM and two-view DBT. Readers scored each lesion separately for probability of malignancy on screen-film mammography, FFDM, and then DBT. The scores were compared with the presence or absence of malignancy based on the final histopathology outcome. RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-eight women participated (93.2% recruitment rate). Following assessment 204 (26.8%) were diagnosed as malignant (147 invasive and 57 in-situ tumours), 286 (37.68%) as benign, and 269 (35.4%) as normal. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by using receiving operating characteristic (ROC) and measurement of area under the curve (AUC). The AUC values demonstrated a significant (p = 0.0001) improvement in the diagnostic accuracy with the addition of DBT combined with FFDM and film-screen mammography (AUC = 0.9671) when compared to FFDM plus film-screen mammography (AUC = 0.8949) and film-screen mammography alone (AUC = 0.7882). The effect was significantly greater for soft-tissue lesions [AUC was 0.9905 with the addition of DBT and AUC was 0.9201 for FFDM with film-screen mammography combined (p = 0.0001)] compared to microcalcification [with the addition of DBT (AUC = 0.7920) and for FFDM with film-screen mammography combined (AUC = 0.7843; p = 0.3182)]. CONCLUSION: The addition of DBT increases the accuracy of mammography compared to FFDM and film-screen mammography combined and film-screen mammography alone in the assessment of screen-detected soft-tissue mammographic abnormalities."

This algorithm is called variational stationary noise remover. It can be interpreted both as a restoration method in a Bayesian framework and as a cartoon+texture decomposition method. In numerous denoising applications, the white noise assumption fails. For example, structured patterns such as stripes appear in the images. The model described here addresses these cases. Applications are presented with images acquired using different modalities: scanning electron microscope, FIB-nanotomography, and an emerging fluorescence microscopy technique called selective plane illumination microscopy."

They can be applied on the diagnosis of various diseases and the assessment of treatment effects. Osteoporosis is an aging disease that reduces the density of bones and increases the risk of bone fracture. Literatures indicate that osteoporosis is associated with the ratio of trabecular bone tissues and bone marrow cells, and bones in osteoporosis patients consist of a significantly higher marrow fat content. Interactive segmentation of bone tissue and different types of bone marrow cells in high-resolution histological images, however, is a very tedious and labor-intensive process. The aim of this study is to develop an automatic algorithm to quantify the areas of different tissues such as the trabecular bones and yellow and red marrow cells. This image segmentation method consists of a series of mathematical morphological operation steps based on both the color and morphology features of tissues and was implemented in Matlab. The results obtained from the proposed method have been verified by comparing with those obtained interactively from an experienced histotechnician (Pearson correlation coefficient > 0.94, P < 0.001). The result suggests that the proposed algorithm can effectively assist physicians to quantify stained bone histological images."

Epub 2012 Sep 5.,Basaruddin KS,Med Biol Eng Comput,2012,2012/09/06,,,10.1007/s11517-012-0951-3,"Trabecular bone has a complicated porous microstructure and consists of interconnected plates and rods known as trabeculae. The microarchitecture of the trabeculae contributes to load distribution capacity and, particularly, the optimal bone strength. Many previous studies have shown that morphological parameters are used to characterize the microarchitecture of trabecular bone, but little is known about the mechanical role of trabecular morphology in the context of load-bearing behavior. Therefore, this study proposes a new segmentation method for examining the morphology of trabecular structure foci of load-bearing capability. A micro-finite element model of trabecular bone was obtained from the fourth lumbar vertebra on the basis of a three-dimensionally reconstructed micro-computed tomography (CT) image. We used an asymptotic homogenization method to determine microscopic stress by applying three unidirectional compressive loads in the vertical, anteroposterior, and right-left axes of two trabecular bone volumes. We then classified the complicated trabecular microstructure into three segments: primary and secondary trabeculae and trabeculae of no contribution. Next, a dynamic analysis was conducted by applying a force impulse load. The result indicated that 1/3 of the trabecular volume functions as primary trabecula. The morphology of the trabecular network could be visualized successfully highlighting the percolation of the stress wave in the primary trabecular segment. Further, we found that the role of the plate-like structures was that of a hub in the trabecular network system."

In this study, IVUS/IVPA imaging of atherosclerotic rabbit aortas following systemic injection of gold nanorods (AUNRs) with peak absorbance within the tissue optical window is performed. Ex vivo imaging results reveal a high photoacoustic signal from localized AUNRs in regions with atherosclerotic plaques. Corresponding histological staining further confirms the preferential extravasation of AUNRs in atherosclerotic regions with compromised luminal endothelium and acute inflammation. The ability to detect AUNRs using combined IVUS and photoacoustic imaging in the presence of luminal saline and luminal blood is evaluated using both spectroscopic and single wavelength IVPA imaging techniques. Results demonstrate that AUNR detection within the arterial wall can be achieved using both methods, even in the case of imaging through luminal blood."

The specimens were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, stained with hematoxylin-eosin and immunostained with anti-PSA antibody and DAB-based detection system. The ImageJ software was used as an image analysis system. With this system the images of glandular tissue were divided into individual cells using the Voronoi tessellation method. The crude and standardized optical densities as well as the basic morphometric features of cells were measured. RESULTS: There is a strong statistically significant correlation between the value of optical density of anti-PSA immunostained prostate cancer cells and the level of histological differentiation (Gleason's pattern). Gleason pattern 5 cell optical density histogram was bimodal, which means that there are 2 cell populations which are statistically significantly different. CONCLUSION: The Voronoi tessellation is an effective method for dividing the immunostained images with cytoplasmically-located antigens into single cells."

SUMMARY ANSWER: Compared with normal BMI patients, severe obesity was associated with a greater prevalence of spindle anomalies and non-aligned chromosomes in failed fertilized oocytes. WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Obesity is associated with poor reproductive outcomes, but little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms. To address potential mechanisms, our study compared the cytoskeletal and chromosome organization in failed fertilized oocytes from severely obese and normal BMI patients. DESIGN: The study population was drawn from IVF patients treated in a hospital-based infertility clinic between February 2010 and July 2011. The prevalence of meiotic spindle and chromosome alignment anomalies in failed fertilized oocytes from patients with severe obesity (i.e. Class II and III; BMI 35.0-50.1 kg/m(2)) was compared with those from patients with normal BMI (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). Oocytes were fixed and then labeled for tubulin, actin and chromatin. Spindle number and integrity, as well as chromosome alignment, were assessed using immunofluorescence microscopy and, in some cases, confocal microscopy. Generalized estimating equations were applied, which account for the correlation among oocytes from the same patient to estimate odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and two-sided Wald P-values. Models were adjusted for continuous age at cycle start, cycle type (IVF or ICSI) and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) a priori. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: University-affiliated infertility clinic. A total of 276 oocytes that failed to fertilize from 137 patients were evaluated: 105 oocytes from severely obese women (n = 47) and 171 oocytes from normal BMI patients (n = 90). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: (i) Significantly more oocytes from the severely obese group exhibited two spindles compared with those from the normal BMI group (58.9 versus 35.1%; OR = 2.68, CI = 1.39-5.15, P-value = 0.003). (ii) Among oocytes with a single spindle, those from severely obese patients showed a significantly higher prevalence of disarranged spindles with non-aligned chromosomes compared with those from normal BMI patients (28.6 versus 8.6%; OR = 4.58, CI = 1.05-19.86, P-value = 0.04). BIAS, CONFOUNDING AND OTHER REASONS FOR CAUTION: Inclusion of only failed fertilized oocytes, small sample size, unknown factors such as non-PCOS comorbidity. GENERALIZABILITY TO OTHER POPULATIONS: For this study, by design, it is unclear whether the findings are generalizable to successfully fertilized oocytes, and whether this oocyte-level influence of obesity is generalizable to infertile women who do not undergo stimulation or, more broadly, to spontaneous conceptions in fertile women. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): none. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: n/a."

This quantification is often hampered by low signal to noise ratio, in particular when complex substrates are employed to emulate in vivo cell migration in geometrically complex environments. Moreover, information about the cell motion, readily available inside the migrating cell layers, is not usually harvested. We introduce Cell Image Velocimetry (CIV), a combination of cell layer segmentation and image velocimetry algorithms, to drastically enhance the quantification of cell migration by wound healing assays. The resulting software analyses the speed of the interface as well as the detailed velocity field inside the cell layers in an automated fashion. CIV is shown to be highly robust for images with low signal to noise ratio, low contrast and frame shifting and it is portable across various experimental settings. The modular design and parametrization of CIV is not restricted to wound healing assays and allows for the exploration and quantification of flow phenomena in any optical microscopy dataset. Here, we demonstrate the capabilities of CIV in wound healing assays over topographically engineered surfaces and quantify the relative merits of differently aligned gratings on cell migration."

For this study, 40 patients with LN and 40 age-matched patients with minimal change disease (controls) were included. Their clinical features were noted, renal biopsy changes classified according to the modified World Health Organization classification of LN and activity and chronicity indices were calculated. Arteriolar morphometric parameters were obtained using manual tracing and an image analysis software. Appropriate statistical tests were applied to assess significance of difference between various groups. Arteriolar wall thickness as well as circumference was significantly higher in all classes of LN as compared with controls (P <0.05). However, no difference was observed in the wall-to-lumen ratio between the two groups (P >0.05). An inter-class analysis of LN did not show any significant difference for any of the arteriolar morphometric parameters (P >0.05). No correlation was found between activity or chronicity indices and the various arteriolar morphometric parameters. This study demonstrates morphometric evidence of arteriolar wall changes in LN. Although no correlation was found with the histological features, further studies are required in this area."

Motivated by various animal species with polarization vision as well as by the prospect of improving the image quality of the imaging systems, we are exploring the potential of polarization for microscope imaging. The most powerful techniques for molecule monitoring requires complex preprocessing for labeling the sample with different dyes. In this paper, we propose a cell detection method using polarization imaging without any need for staining target cell samples with any chemical dye. The motivation for this work is to develop an optical imaging technique that is simple and that can be used on live cells. The polarization sensitivity of cell samples is studied in this paper. A definition for the quantity called ""polarization deviation"" is proposed in order to identify clearer the difference between target cells and the background. Based on the polarization deviation detection method, a three-parameter polarization imaging method is employed to further simplify the image capture procedure for the proposed label-free cell detection. A color imaging methodology based on the well-known color space is utilized in order to represent the captured polarization information using computer graphics."

We propose a prototype application for performing thalamus target map individualization by fusing patient-specific thalamus geometric information and diffusion tensor tractography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Previously, our workgroup developed a thalamus atlas by fusing anatomic information from 7 histologically processed thalami. Thalamocortical connectivity maps were generated from DTI scans of 40 subjects by using a previously described procedure and were mapped to a standard neuroimaging space. These data were merged into a statistical shape model describing the morphologic variability of the thalamic outline, nuclei, and connectivity landmarks. This model was used to deform the atlas to individual images. Postmortem MR imaging scans were used to quantify the accuracy of nuclei predictions. RESULTS: Reliable tractography-based markers were located in the ventral lateral thalamus, with the somatosensory connections coinciding with the VPLa and VPLp nuclei; and motor/premotor connections, with the VLpv and VLa nuclei. Prediction accuracy of thalamus outlines was higher with the SSM approach than the ACPC alignment of data (0.56 mm versus 1.24; Dice overlap: 0.87 versus 0.7); for individual nuclei: 0.65 mm, Dice: 0.63 (SSM); 1.24 mm, Dice: 0.4 (ACPC). CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have already applied DTI to the thalamus. As a further step in this direction, we demonstrate a hybrid approach by using statistical shape models, which have the potential to cope with intersubject variations in individual thalamus geometry."

Commercially available programs that measure histomorphometric parameters can be cost-prohibitive. In this study, we compared an inexpensive method of histomorphometry to a current proprietary software program. METHODS AND RESULTS: Image J and Adobe Photoshop((R)) were used to measure static and kinetic bone histomorphometric parameters. Photomicrographs of Goldner's trichrome-stained femurs were used to generate black-and-white image masks, representing bone and non-bone tissue, respectively, in Adobe Photoshop((R)) . The masks were used to quantify histomorphometric parameters (bone volume, tissue volume, osteoid volume, mineralizing surface and interlabel width) in Image J. The resultant values obtained using Image J and the proprietary software were compared and differences found to be statistically non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: The wide-ranging use of histomorphometric analysis for assessing the basic morphology of tissue components makes it important to have affordable and accurate measurement options available for a diverse range of applications. Here we have developed and validated an approach to histomorphometry using commonly and freely available software that is comparable to a much more costly, commercially available software program."

SGS and labial salivary gland biopsy were performed on 95 SS patients and 36 healthy age-matched and sex-matched volunteers. Uptake ratios at 15 min (UR(15)) and stimulated excretion fraction (EF) of each parotid and submandibular gland were calculated automatically from SGS; histopathologic grades were classified based on focal lymphocytic infiltration, and biopsy focus scores were calculated simultaneously. As a result, the UR(15) and EF of each salivary gland in SS patients were significantly lower than that in controls. Multivariate logistic regression equation was: logit p = 6.965 - 1.680 x UR(15) of left submandibular gland - 0.040 x EF of left parotid gland - 0.050 x EF of right submandibular gland. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve validated high efficiency of this model with the area under curve of 0.911. And logistic regression analysis on combined original and validation cohorts confirmed its diagnostic value. Moreover, the EF of right parotid gland and both submandibular glands was correlated with histopathologic changes. Consequently, the semi-quantitative parameters of SGS may be helpful for diagnosing SS; UR(15) of left submandibular gland, EF of left parotid gland, and EF of right submandibular gland are more powerful predictor of SS. Besides, SGS parameters reflect the degree of salivary gland involvement, severe patients with low parameters would have high histopathologic grades and biopsy focus scores."

Subsequently, the solution is formulated within a multireference level set framework. This approach has been validated on manually annotated samples and then applied to the TCGA glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) dataset consisting of 440 whole mount tissue sections scanned with either a 20 x or 40 x objective, in which, each tissue section varies in size from 40k x 40k pixels to 100k x 100k pixels. Experimental results show a superior performance of the proposed method in comparison with present state of art techniques."

This system discriminated pulmonary tissue components and demonstrated distinct acoustic images of the lung; these results corresponded well to those obtained using the conventional microscope. SAM provides the following benefits: (1) images are acquired in only few minutes without requirement for staining, (2) basic data is obtained for low-frequency ultrasonic examination, and (3) speed of sound from each lesion is digital and comparable among diseases. Comparative analysis of cancer invasion, post-inflammatory fibrosis, and deposition disease was possible using the data obtained with the system, and the results showed good correlation with those using the conventional microscope and by clinical diagnosis. The SAM system is applicable not only to pulmonary diseases but also to various diseases in other organs."

Epub 2012 Sep 30.,Veyrieres JB,Eur J Radiol,2012,2012/10/04,,,10.1016/j.ejrad.2012.09.002,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the ability of a threshold value in ShearWave elastography to rule out malignant thyroid nodules while studying its pertinence in association with morphological signs. EQUIPMENT AND METHODS: 148 patients (110 women and 38 men; 52.5 y.o. 15.8) referred for surgery of thyroid nodules underwent standard ultrasound as well as elastography. Characteristics of the morphological signs and maximum elastographic index were calculated in relation to histology. Association of morphological signs alone and then of elastography was also evaluated. One hundred and fifty one nodules were studied on a double-blind basis. RESULTS: 297 nodules were studied. Thirty-five cancers were detected (11.6%). Elastographic index was higher in malignant nodules (115 kPa 60.4) than in benign nodules (41 kPa 25.8) (p<0.001, Student's t-test). Cut off value of 66 kPa was the best to discriminate malignant nodules with a sensitivity of 80% (CI 95%, 62.5; 90.9) and a specificity of 90.5% (CI 95%, 86.1; 93.6) (p=0.0001). Association of elastography and morphological ultrasound signs presented a sensitivity of 97% (CI 95%, 83.3; 99.8) and a negative predictive value of 99.5% (CI 95%, 95.6; 99.9). Interobserver reproducibility proved to be excellent with an interclass correlation of 0.97 (CI 95%, 0.96; 0.98) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The 66 kPa threshold in Shear Wave elastography is the best ultrasound sign to rule out malignant thyroid nodules. The method is simple, quantitative, reproducible and usable in the study of nodules larger than 3 cm. Progress must still be made in the study of calcified nodules and follicular tumors."

Epub 2012 Oct 2.,Bluekens AM,Radiology,2012,2012/10/04,,,10.1148/radiol.12111461,"PURPOSE: To compare screen-film mammography with digital mammography in a breast cancer screening program, with a focus on the clinical relevance of detected cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the regional medical ethics review board. Informed consent was not required. Before the nationwide transition to digital mammography in the Dutch biennial screening program, the performance of digital mammography was studied in three screening regions. For initial screening examinations, mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views were obtained of each breast. In subsequent examinations, the mediolateral oblique view was standard. A craniocaudal view was added if indicated. Screening outcomes obtained with screen-film mammography and digital mammography, including radiologic and pathologic characteristics, were compared for initial and subsequent examinations. RESULTS: A total of 1,198,493 screening examinations were performed between 2003 and 2007. Recall was indicated in 18 896 cases (screen-film mammography: 2.6% at initial examinations, 1.3% at subsequent examinations; digital mammography: 4.4% at initial examinations, 2.1% at subsequent examinations; P < .001 for both). Breast cancer was diagnosed in 6410 women (detection rate per 1000 women with screen-film mammography: 5.6 at initial examinations, 5.2 at subsequent examinations; detection rate per 1000 women with digital mammography: 6.8 at initial examinations, 6.1 at subsequent examinations; P = .02 and P < .001, respectively). Digital mammography depicted significantly more ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions, irrespective of screening round. Invasive carcinoma was detected significantly more often in subsequent examinations, particularly when associated with microcalcifications (P = .047). The distribution of the histopathologic differentiation grades for DCIS and invasive carcinoma were similar with both modalities. However, with digital mammography more high-grade DCIS lesions were detected at subsequent examinations (P = .013). CONCLUSION: In a population-based breast screening program, the performance of digital mammography in the detection of DCIS and invasive carcinoma was substantially better than that of screen-film mammography. There is no sign of an increase in detection of low-grade DCIS lesions-indicative of possible overdiagnosis-with digital breast cancer screening. Rather, digital mammography appears to add to the detection of high-grade DCIS."
23304815,A robust automatic nuclei segmentation technique for quantitative histopathological image analysis,"Lu C, Mahmood M, Jha N, Mandal M.",Anal Quant Cytopathol Histpathol. 2012 Dec;34(6):296-308.,Lu C,Anal Quant Cytopathol Histpathol,2012,2013/01/12,,,,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a computer-aided robust nuclei segmentation technique for quantitative histopathological image analysis. STUDY DESIGN: A robust nuclei segmentation technique for histopathological image analysis is proposed. The proposed technique uses a hybrid morphological reconstruction module to reduce the intensity variation within the nuclei regions and suppress the noise in the image. A local region adaptive threshold selection module based on local optimal threshold is used to segment the nuclei. The technique incorporates domain-specific knowledge of skin histopathological images for more accurate segmentation results. RESULTS: The technique is compared to the manually labeled nuclei locations and nuclei boundaries for the performance evaluations. On different histopathological images of skin epidermis with complex background, containing more than 3000 nuclei, the technique provides a good nuclei detection performance: 88.11% sensitivity rate, 80.02% positive prediction rate and only 5.34% under-segmentation rate compared to the manually labeled nuclei locations. Compared to the 110 manually segmented nuclei regions, the proposed technique provides a good segmentation performance (in terms of the nucleus area, perimeter, and form factor). CONCLUSION: The proposed technique is able to provide more accurate segmentation performance compared to the existing techniques and can be employed for quantitative analysis of the histopathological images."

METHODS: A total of 38 patients were prospectively examined using 1.5-T MRI. Data were acquired from regions of interest in the liver and spleen by using time series of single-breath-hold symmetrically sampled two-point Dixon 3D images (non-enhanced, arterial and venous portal phase; 3, 10, 20 and 30 min) following a bolus injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA (0.025 mmol/kg). The signal intensity (SI) values were reconstructed using a phase-sensitive technique and normalised using multiscale adaptive normalising averaging (MANA). Liver-to-spleen contrast ratios (LSC_N) and the contrast uptake rate (K (Hep)) were calculated. Liver biopsy was performed and classified according to the Batts and Ludwig system. RESULTS: Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.71, 0.80 and 0.78, respectively, were found for K (Hep), LSC_N10 and LSC_N20 with regard to severe versus mild fibrosis. Significant group differences were found for K (Hep) (borderline), LSC_N10 and LSC_N20. CONCLUSIONS: Liver fibrosis stage strongly influences the hepatocyte-specific uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA. Potentially the normalisation technique and K (Hep) will reduce patient and system bias, yielding a robust approach to non-invasive liver function determination."

METHODS AND RESULTS:   A VR microscope was designed and implemented by combining ultra-high-resolution displays with VR technology, techniques for fast interaction, and high usability. It was evaluated using a mixed factorial experimental design with technology and task as within-participant variables and grade of histopathologist as a between-participant variable. Time to diagnosis was similar for the conventional and VR microscopes. However, there was a significant difference in the mean magnification used between the two technologies, with participants working at a higher level of magnification on the VR microscope. CONCLUSIONS:   The results suggest that, with the right technology, efficient use of digital pathology for routine practice is a realistic possibility. Further work is required to explore what magnification is required on the VR microscope for histopathologists to identify diagnostic features, and the effect on this of the digital slide production process."

Epub 2012 Aug 10.,Savage A,Dis Model Mech,2013,2012/08/14,PMC3529355,,10.1242/dmm.009886,"In cancer, morphological assessment of histological tissue samples is a fundamental part of both diagnosis and prognosis. Image analysis offers opportunities to support that assessment through quantitative metrics of morphology. Generally, morphometric analysis is carried out on two-dimensional tissue section data and so only represents a small fraction of any tumour. We present a novel application of three-dimensional (3D) morphometrics for 3D imaging data obtained from tumours grown in a culture model. Minkowski functionals, a set of measures that characterise geometry and topology in n-dimensional space, are used to quantify tumour topology in the absence of and in response to therapeutic intervention. These measures are used to stratify the morphological response of tumours to therapeutic intervention. Breast tumours are characterised by estrogen receptor (ER) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 status and tumour grade. Previously, we have shown that ER status is associated with tumour volume in response to tamoxifen treatment ex vivo. Here, HER2 status is found to predict the changes in morphology other than volume as a result of tamoxifen treatment ex vivo. Finally, we show the extent to which Minkowski functionals might be used to predict tumour grade. Minkowski functionals are generalisable to any 3D data set, including in vivo and cellular systems. This quantitative topological analysis can provide a valuable link among biomarkers, drug intervention and tumour morphology that is complementary to existing, non-morphological measures of tumour response to intervention and could ultimately inform patient treatment."

Three different patterns of Gag distribution could be distinguished. A major type of assembly observed was in accordance with previous electron microscopy analyses revealing ~140 nm-sized HIV-1 buds at the plasma membrane of virus-producing cells. The distribution of Gag molecules in the 2D projection at these sites was consistent with a semi-spherical 3D assembly. We compared different methods of cluster analysis and demonstrated that we can reliably distinguish different distribution patterns of the Gag polyprotein. These methods were applied to extract information on the properties of the different Gag clusters.

The electrical activation sequence of the ventricles depends strongly on the cardiac conduction system (CCS). Its morphology and function cannot be observed in vivo, and therefore data available come from histological studies. We present a review on data available of the peripheral CCS including new experiments. In order to build a realistic model of the CCS we designed a procedure to extract morphological characteristics of the CCS from stained calf tissue samples. A CCS model personalized with our measurements has been built using L-systems. The effect of key unknown parameters of the model in the electrical activation of the left ventricle has been analyzed. The CCS models generated share the main characteristics of observed stained Purkinje networks. The timing of the simulated electrical activation sequences were in the physiological range for CCS models that included enough density of PMJs. These results show that this approach is a potential methodology for collecting knowledge-domain data and build improved CCS models of the heart automatically."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight radiologists who specialized in breast imaging retrospectively reviewed 217 consecutively accrued lesions by using protocols that were HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved in 182 patients aged 31-60 years (mean, 50 years) who underwent diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis. The lesions in the cohort included 33% (72 of 217) cancers and 67% (145 of 217) benign lesions. Eighty-four percent (182 of 217) of the lesions were masses, 11% (25 of 217) were asymmetries, and 5% (10 of 217) were distortions that were initially detected at clinical examination in 8% (17 of 217), at mammography in 80% (173 of 217), at ultrasonography (US) in 11% (25 of 217), or at magnetic resonance imaging in 1% (2 of 217). Histopathologic examination established truth in 191 lesions, US revealed a cyst in 12 lesions, and 14 lesions had a normal follow-up. Each lesion was interpreted once with tomosynthesis and once with supplemental mammographic views; both modes included the mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views in a fully crossed and balanced design by using a five-category Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment and a probability-of-malignancy score. Differences between modes were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model for BI-RADS-based sensitivity and specificity and with modified Obuchowski-Rockette approach for probability-of-malignancy-based area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Average probability-of-malignancy-based area under the ROC curve was 0.87 for tomosynthesis versus 0.83 for supplemental views (P < .001). With tomosynthesis, the false-positive rate decreased from 85% (989 of 1160) to 74% (864 of 1160) (P < .01) for cases that were rated BI-RADS category 3 or higher and from 57% (663 of 1160) to 48% (559 of 1160) for cases rated BI-RADS category 4 or 5 (P < .01), without a meaningful change in sensitivity. With tomosynthesis, more cancers were classified as BI-RADS category 5 (39% [226 of 576] vs 33% [188 of 576]; P = .017) without a decrease in specificity. CONCLUSION: Tomosynthesis significantly improved diagnostic accuracy for noncalcified lesions compared with supplemental mammographic views."

The results of experimental studies using xenografted tumors to evaluate novel cancer treatments may therefore vary considerably depending on the blood supply of the specific tumor model being used. Mechanisms underlying intertumor heterogeneity in the blood supply of xenografted tumors derived from same tumor line are poorly understood, and were investigated here by using intravital microscopy to assess tumor blood supply and vascular morphology in human melanomas growing in dorsal window chambers in BALB/c nu/nu mice. Two melanoma lines, A-07 and R-18, were included in the study. These lines differed substantially in angiogenic profiles. Thus, when the expression of 84 angiogenesis-related genes was investigated with a quantitative PCR array, 25% of these genes showed more than a 10-fold difference in expression. Furthermore, A-07 tumors showed higher vascular density, higher vessel tortuosity, higher vessel diameters, shorter vessel segments, and more chaotic vascular architecture than R-18 tumors. Both lines showed large intertumor heterogeneity in blood supply. In the A-07 line, tumors with low microvascular density, long vessel segment, and high vessel tortuosity showed poor blood supply, whereas in the R-18 line, poor tumor blood supply was associated with low tumor arteriolar diameters. Thus, tumor-line specific causes of intertumor heterogeneity in blood supply were identified in human melanoma xenografts, and these tumor-line specific mechanisms were possibly a result of tumor-line specific angiogenic profiles."

In content based image retrieval, feature combination plays a key role. It aims at enhancing the descriptive power of visual features corresponding to semantically meaningful queries. It is particularly valuable in histology image analysis where intelligent mechanisms are needed for interpreting varying tissue composition and architecture into histological concepts. This paper presents an approach to automatically combine heterogeneous visual features for histology image retrieval. The aim is to obtain the most representative fusion model for a particular keyword that is associated to multiple query images. The core of this approach is a multi-objective learning method, which aims to understand an optimal visual-semantic matching function by jointly considering the different preferences of the group of query images. The task is posed as an optimisation problem, and a multi-objective optimisation strategy is employed in order to handle potential contradictions in the query images associated to the same keyword. Experiments were performed on two different collections of histology images. The results show that it is possible to improve a system for content based histology image retrieval by using an appropriately defined multi-feature fusion model, which takes careful consideration of the structure and distribution of visual features."

Knowing the carotid plaque characteristics by analyzing the plaque composition only at the minimum lumen site will facilitate plaque diagnosis using VH IVUS. PURPOSE: To detect the relationship between the VH IVUS volumetric analysis of the entire plaque responsible for carotid artery stenosis and the VH IVUS cross-section plaque analysis at the minimum lumen site. METHODS: Forty-eight atherosclerotic cervical carotid stenoses in 45 consecutive patients were included in the study. VH IVUS was obtained during the carotid artery stenting procedure. RESULTS: Simple regression analysis revealed that the volumetric proportion of each plaque type correlated significantly with the corresponding plaque-type area at the minimum lumen site. The adjusted coefficients of determination of the simple regression analyses were .782 (P < .001) for fibrous tissue, .741 (P < .001) for fibrofatty tissue, .864 (P < .001) for dense calcium, and .918 (P < .001) for necrotic core. CONCLUSION: The plaque composition at the minimum lumen site represents the volumetric composition of the entire carotid plaque that causes atherosclerotic cervical carotid artery stenosis."

METHODS: The local institutional review board approved the study, and all patients provided written informed consent. We examined 168 thyroid nodules (52 malignant and 116 benign) with freehand elastography. The elastogram was performed with both the five-degree elastography score system and thyroid tissue-to-nodule strain ratio before core biopsies as standard reference. The area under the curve (AUC) and the best cut-off point were both obtained using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both techniques were compared with the chi(2) test. Furthermore, strain ratio distribution was also compared with histopathological result. P<.05 was considered to indicate significance. RESULTS: The strain ratio distribution of malignant thyroid nodules significantly differed from that of benign nodules (all P<.001). The AUC of strain ratio was higher than that of the elastography score system (0.907 vs. 0.829; P<.05). By applying the best cut-off point of 3.855 for strain ratio and 3.5 for the elastography score system, strain ratio had significantly higher specificity (P<.05) in detecting malignant thyroid nodules. However, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity in distinguishing malignant thyroid nodules from benign ones between strain ratio and the elastography score system (P>.05). CONCLUSION: Strain ratio is more specific than conventional elastography score system in differentiating malignant from benign thyroid nodules."

Molars with either NEC or NE were quantitatively analyzed regarding the mineral, organic and water volumes (considered as effective pore volume), opacity (predicted in 94% of cases by water volume in NEC), and water volume more easily available for diffusion, alphad (squared water volume divided by the nonmineral volume; related to permeability). NEC presented lower mineral volumes and higher organic volumes, effective pore volume and opacity than NE. External origin of organic volume in NEC was evidenced by an organic gradient decreasing from the surface inward (R2 = -0.7), which was not detected in teeth with NE only; alphad values of the SL and NE were similar and both were lower (p < 0.0001) than that of the BL. Comparing the SL from both NEC and artificial enamel caries (AEC; published data; n = 71), with similar mineral volumes, against developing enamel (published data), AEC showed more effective pore volume (3 times higher), higher alphad and opacity than NEC mainly due to differences in organic volumes. Our results reasonably matched widely known features of NEC histological zones, and confirmed the organic volume as the main variable for explaining optical properties and alphad (related to permeability)."

In this manuscript, we report a comparison of immunohistochemical (IHC), histopathological and spectral histopathological results for colon cancer tissue sections. A supervised algorithm, based on the ""random forest"" methodology, was trained using classical histopathology, and used to automatically identify colon tissue types, and areas of colon adenocarcinoma. The SHP images subsequently were compared to IHC-based images. This comparison revealed excellent agreement between the methods, and demonstrated that label-free SHP detects compositional changes in tissue that are the basis of the sensitivity of IHC."

Computer-assisted classification of cancer cells can alleviate the burden of manual labeling and help cancer research. In this paper, we present a novel computerized method for cancer cell line image classification. The aim is to automatically classify 14 different classes of cell lines including 7 classes of breast and 7 classes of liver cancer cells. Microscopic images containing irregular carcinoma cell patterns are represented by subwindows which correspond to foreground pixels. For each subwindow, a covariance descriptor utilizing the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-[Formula: see text]WT) coefficients and several morphological attributes are computed. Directionally selective DT-[Formula: see text]WT feature parameters are preferred primarily because of their ability to characterize edges at multiple orientations which is the characteristic feature of carcinoma cell line images. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel is employed for final classification. Over a dataset of 840 images, we achieve an accuracy above 98%, which outperforms the classical covariance-based methods. The proposed system can be used as a reliable decision maker for laboratory studies. Our tool provides an automated, time- and cost-efficient analysis of cancer cell morphology to classify different cancer cell lines using image-processing techniques, which can be used as an alternative to the costly short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. The data set used in this manuscript is available as supplementary material through http://signal.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/cancerCellLineClassificationSampleImages.html."

In addition to the enhancement in the x and y directions, it also allows enhancement of resolution in the z- direction by the same factor of two (to approximately 220 nm), making it a powerful tool for 3-D morphology studies of fluorescently labeled cells or thin tissue sections. In this report, we applied this technique to several types of blood cells that are commonly seen in hematopathology. Compared with standard brightfield and ordinary fluorescence microscopy images, the 3-D morphology results clearly reveal the morphological features of different types of normal blood cells. We have also used this technique to evaluate morphologies of abnormal erythrocytes and compare them with those recorded on normal cells. The results give a very intuitive presentation of morphological structures of erythrocytes with great details. This research illustrates the potential of this technique to be used in hematology and cyto-pathology studies aimed at identifying nanometer-sized features that cannot be distinguished otherwise with conventional optical microscopy."

In vivo, extracellular HMGB1 can bind Toll-like receptor 4 on the surface of dendritic cells, de facto operating as a danger-associated molecular pattern and alarming the organism to the presence of stressful conditions. Recent results indicate that the release of HMGB1 is one of the key features for cell death to be perceived as immunogenic, i.e., to be capable of triggering a cognate immune response in vivo. Thus, only anticancer agents that-among other features-allow for the release of HMGB1 as they induce cell death are expected to stimulate anticancer immune responses. To investigate the immunogenic potential of conventional anticancer agents and novel cell death inducers on a high-throughput scale, we engineered human osteosarcoma U2OS cells to express HMGB1 fused at the N-terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Coupled to fluorescence microscopy workstations for automated image acquisition and analysis, this HMGB1-GFP-based biosensor is amenable for the identification of potential inducers of immunogenic cell death among large chemical libraries."

For this purpose, 14 mammal and seven poultry samples and a total of 1081 bone fragment lacunae were analysed by combining the microscopic methods with computer image analysis. The distribution of 30 different measured size and shape bone lacunae variables were studied both within and between the two zoological classes. In all cases a considerable overlap between classes meant that classification of individual lacunae was problematic, though a clear separation in the means did allow successful classification of samples on the basis of averages. The variables most useful for classification were those related to size, lacuna area for example. The approach shows considerable promise but will need further study using a larger number of samples with a wider range."

Electronic imaging with a CCD involves three stages--interaction of a photon with the photosensitive surface, storage of the liberated charge, and readout or measurement of the stored charge. The most demanding applications in fluorescence microscopy may require as much as four orders of greater magnitude sensitivity. The image in the present-day light microscope is usually acquired with a CCD camera. The CCD is composed of a large matrix of photosensitive elements (often referred to as ""pixels"" shorthand for picture elements, which simultaneously capture an image over the entire detector surface. The light-intensity information for each pixel is stored as electronic charge and is converted to an analog voltage by a readout amplifier. This analog voltage is subsequently converted to a numerical value by a digitizer situated on the CCD chip, or very close to it. Several (three to six) amplifiers are required for each pixel, and to date, uniform images with a homogeneous background have been a problem because of the inherent difficulties of balancing the gain in all of the amplifiers. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensors also exhibit relatively high noise associated with the requisite high-speed switching. Both of these deficiencies are being addressed, and sensor performance is nearing that required for scientific imaging."

Correlative microscopy provides a unique platform to combine the particular strength of each microscopic approach and compensate for its specific limitations. As an example, we report results of a correlative microscopic study exploring features of the nuclear landscape in HeLa cells. We present a detailed protocol to first investigate distinct structural features of a living cell in space and time (4D) using spinning disk laser scanning microscopy (SDLSM). Then, after fixation and staining of selected structures (e.g., by means of immunodetection), details of these structures are explored at increasingly higher resolution using three-dimensional (3D) confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM); super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, such as three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM); and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We discuss problems involved in the comparison of images of a given cell nucleus recorded with different microscopic approaches, which requires not only a compensation for different resolutions but also for various distortions."

We examined each optical characteristic and change in intraoperative visibility using brilliant blue G (BBG) staining with various sharp cut filters (SCFs). METHOD: This was a retrospective and observational study. The system was composed of several filters attached to the operating microscope. Six eyes from 6 patients who presented with macular hole and underwent surgery using this system were studied. As a clinical examination, the intraoperative visibility of BBG staining intensities was compared for 4 kinds of SCFs during vitrectomy. Quantitative evaluation was calculated using the International Commission on Illumination 1976 (L*, a*, b*) color space (CIELAB) method. Furthermore, we evaluated each optical characteristic of 4 types of SCFs using extracted porcine eyes and a spectroradiometer as a clinical simulation. RESULTS: Suitable filter selection was possible for this system. The observed color tone and spectral irradiance changes with SCF insertion changed dynamically. In macular hole cases, the color intensities between BBG-stained and nonstained areas were improved using SCF-455 and SCF-520, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05) by CIELAB. CONCLUSION: The system improved BBG staining intensity with the use of selective SCFs."

The main causes are thought to be the complexity of morphological details varying from tumor to tumor and from patient to patient, variations in the technical histopathological procedures like staining protocols, and finally the individual experience of the diagnosing pathologist. Thus, to raise astrocytoma grading to a more objective standard, this paper proposes a methodology based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) derived images made from histopathological samples in combination with data mining techniques. By comparing AFM images with corresponding light microscopy images of the same area, the progressive formation of cavities due to cell necrosis was identified as a typical morphological marker for a computer-assisted analysis. Using genetic programming as a tool for feature analysis, a best model was created that achieved 94.74% classification accuracy in distinguishing grade II tumors from grade IV ones. While utilizing modern image analysis techniques, AFM may become an important tool in astrocytic tumor diagnosis. By this way patients suffering from grade II tumors are identified unambiguously, having a less risk for malignant transformation. They would benefit from early adjuvant therapies."

The deformation displacements were measured by an established testing device, and the viscoelasticity was estimated from the measured displacements and Voigt model. The occupancy, density or average size of sebaceous glands was compared with the viscoleasticity. There were three major findings in the comparisons. First, the occupancy of sebaceous gland showed negative correlation with the elasticity. Second, the density of sebaceous glands showed positive correlation with the viscosity. Third, the average size of sebaceous glands showed negative correlation with the viscosity. In conclusion, viscoelastic property of human skin is strongly influenced by the morphology of the sebaceous glands."

The aim of this study is to assess the value of the peri-tumor tissue elasticity in the classification of breast tumors. SWE images of 106 breast tumors (65 benign, 41 malignant) were collected from 82 consecutive patients. By applying the image processing method, 5 elastographic features of the peri-tumor area (elasticity modulus mean, maximum, standard deviation, hardness degree and elasticity ratio) were computed to represent peri-tumor tissue elasticity. B-mode Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) were used for comparing the diagnostic performances between the grayscale US and color SWE images. Histopathologic results were used as the reference standard. The t-test, point biserial correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed for statistical analysis. As a result, the Az values (area under ROC curve) were 0.92, 0.95, 0.94, 0.91, and 0.98 for the classifiers using the five elastographic features respectively, and 0.91 for BI-RADS assessment. The results showed that the peri-tumor tissue elasticity could provide valuable information for breast tumor classification."

In this paper, we present a new approach for the segmentation of severely clustered overlapping nuclei. The proposed approach first involves applying a combined global and local threshold method to extract foreground regions. In order to segment clustered overlapping nuclei in the foreground regions, seed markers are obtained by utilizing morphological filtering and intensity based region growing. Seeded watershed is then applied and clustered nuclei are separated. As pixels corresponding to stained cellular cytoplasm can be falsely identified as belonging to nuclei, a post processing step identifying positive nuclei pixels is added to eliminate these false pixels. This new approach has been tested on a set of manually labeled Tissue Microarray (TMA) and Whole Slide Images (WSI) colorectal cancers stained for the biomarker P53. Experimental results show that it outperformed currently available state of the art methods in nuclei segmentation."

This process is of great biological and clinical interest but is still poorly understood for two main reasons. On the one hand, the existing imaging modalities for investigating EHM suffered from either limited penetration depth or limited spatial resolution. On the other hand, current works typically adopted manual segmentation, which was tedious, subjective, and time consuming considering the complexity of developing heart geometry and the large size of images. In this paper, we propose to utilize confocal microscopy imaging with tissue optical immersion clearing technique to image the heart at different stages of development for EHM study. The imaging method is able to produce high spatial resolution images and achieve large penetration depth at the same time. Furthermore, we propose a novel convex active contour model for automatic image segmentation. The model has the ability to deal with intensity fall-off in depth which is characterized by confocal microscopy images. We acquired the images of embryonic quail hearts from day 6 to day 14 of incubation for EHM study. The experimental results were promising and provided us with an insight view of early heart growth pattern and also paved the road for data-driven heart growth modeling."

Traditionally, graph algorithms (with cell/nuclei as node) have been used to characterize the spatial arrangement of these cells. However, these graphs inherently extract only global features of cell or nuclear architecture and, therefore, important information at the local level may be left unexploited. Additionally, since the graph construction does not draw a distinction between nuclei in the stroma or epithelium, the graph edges often traverse the stromal and epithelial regions. In this paper, we present a new spatially aware cell cluster (SpACC1) graph that can efficiently and accurately model local nuclear interactions, separately within the stromal and epithelial regions alone. SpACC1 is built locally on nodes that are defined on groups/clusters of nuclei rather than individual nuclei. Local nodes are connected with edges which have a certain probability of connectedness. The SpACC1 graph allows for exploration of (a) contribution of nuclear arrangement within the stromal and epithelial regions separately and (b) combined contribution of stromal and epithelial nuclear architecture in predicting disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. In a cohort of 160 p16+ oropharyngeal tumors (141 non-progressors and 19 progressors), a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in conjunction with 7 graph features extracted from the SpACC1 graph yielded a mean accuracy of over 90% with PPV of 89.4% in distinguishing between progressors and non-progressors. Our results suggest that (a) stromal nuclear architecture has a role to play in predicting disease aggressiveness and that (b) combining nuclear architectural contributions from the stromal and epithelial regions yields superior prognostic accuracy compared to individual contributions from stroma and epithelium alone."

The main objective of this work is to employ COrE to quantitatively model disorder of cell/nuclear orientation within local neighborhoods and evaluate whether these measurements of directional disorder are correlated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) in prostate cancer (CaP) patients. COrE has a number of novel attributes that are unique to digital pathology image analysis. Firstly, it is the first rigorous attempt to quantitatively model cell/nuclear orientation. Secondly, it provides for modeling of local cell networks via construction of subgraphs. Thirdly, it allows for quantifying the disorder in local cell orientation via second order statistical features. We evaluated the ability of 39 COrE features to capture the characteristics of cell orientation in CaP tissue microarray (TMA) images in order to predict 10 year BCR in men with CaP following radical prostatectomy. Randomized 3-fold cross-validation via a random forest classifier evaluated on a combination of COrE and other nuclear features achieved an accuracy of 82.7 +/- 3.1% on a dataset of 19 BCR and 20 non-recurrence patients. Our results suggest that COrE features could be extended to characterize disease states in other histological cancer images in addition to prostate cancer."

Here we propose a novel technique of labeling individual glands as malignant or benign. In the first step, the gland and nuclei objects of the images are automatically segmented. Individual gland units are segmented out by consolidating their lumina with the surrounding layers of epithelium and nuclei. The nuclei objects are segmented by using a marker controlled watershed algorithm. Two new features, Number of Nuclei Layer (N(NL)) and Ratio of Epithelial layer area to Lumen area (R(EL)) have been extracted from the segmented units. The main advantage of this approach is that it can detect individual malignant gland units, irrespective of neighboring histology and/or the spatial extent of the cancer. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 40 histopathology scenes taken from 10 high resolution whole mount images and achieved a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.81 in a leave-75%-out cross-validation."

Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) is an autoantibody produced by the immune system directed against the self body tissues or cells, which plays an important role in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Indirect ImmunoFluorescence (IIF) method with HEp-2 cells provides the major screening method to detect ANA for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Fluorescence patterns at present are usually examined laboriously by experienced physicians through manually inspecting the slides with the help of a microscope, which usually suffers from inter-observer variability that limits its reproducibility. Previous researches only provided simple segmentation methods and criterions for cell segmentation and recognition, but a fully automatic framework for the segmentation and recognition of HEp-2 cells had never been reported before. This study proposes a method based on the watershed algorithm to automatically detect the HEp-2 cells with different patterns. The experimental results show that the segmentation performance of the proposed method is satisfactory when evaluated with percent volume overlap (PVO: 89%). The classification performance using a SVM classifier designed based on the features calculated from the segmented cells achieves an average accuracy of 96.90%, which outperforms other methods presented in previous studies. The proposed method can be used to develop a computer-aided system to assist the physicians in the diagnosis of auto-immune diseases."

Subsequently, integration of these indices in whole slide images (WSI), from a large cohort, can provide predictive models of the clinical outcome. However, the performance of the existing histology-based classification techniques is hindered as a result of large technical and biological variations that are always present in a large cohort. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for classification of tissue histology based on predictive sparse decomposition (PSD) and spatial pyramid matching (SPM), which utilize sparse tissue morphometric signatures at various locations and scales. The method has been evaluated on two distinct datasets of different tumor types collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The novelties of our approach are: (i) extensibility to different tumor types; (ii) robustness in the presence of wide technical and biological variations; and (iii) scalability with varying training sample size."

Due to the curse of dimensionality, building classifiers with large numbers of features requires feature selection (which may require a large training set) or dimensionality reduction (DR). DR methods map the original high-dimensional features in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which limits the potential for feature transparency or interpretability. Although methods exist for variable selection and ranking on embeddings obtained via linear DR schemes (e.g., principal components analysis (PCA)), similar methods do not yet exist for nonlinear DR (NLDR) methods. In this work we present a simple yet elegant method for approximating the mapping between the data in the original feature space and the transformed data in the kernel PCA (KPCA) embedding space; this mapping provides the basis for quantification of variable importance in nonlinear kernels (VINK). We show how VINK can be implemented in conjunction with the popular Isomap and Laplacian eigenmap algorithms. VINK is evaluated in the contexts of three different problems in digital pathology: (1) predicting five year PSA failure following radical prostatectomy, (2) predicting Oncotype DX recurrence risk scores for ER+ breast cancers, and (3) distinguishing good and poor outcome p16+ oropharyngeal tumors. We demonstrate that subsets of features identified by VINK provide similar or better classification or regression performance compared to the original high dimensional feature sets."

This paper presents a novel feature design with two main contributions. First, prior to computing the feature descriptors, we propose to transform the images with learning-based filters to obtain more representative feature descriptors. Second, we propose to transform the computed descriptors with another set of learning-based filters to further improve the classification accuracy. In this way, while generic feature descriptors are used, data-adaptive information is integrated into the feature extraction process based on the optimization objective to enhance the discriminative power of feature descriptors. The feature design is applicable to different application domains, and is evaluated on both lung tissue classification in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images and apoptosis detection in time-lapse phase contrast microscopy image sequences. Both experiments show promising performance improvements over the state-of-the-art."

Our method quickly finds a coarse approximation of the solution by exploring a reduced set of partial matches using an approach to which we refer to as Active Testing Search (ATS). We apply the method to registration of graph structures by branching point matching. It is based solely on the geometric position of the points, no additional information is used nor the knowledge of an initial alignment. In the second stage, we use dynamic programming to refine the solution. We tested our algorithm on angiography, retinal fundus, and neuronal data gathered using electron and light microscopy. We show that our method solves cases not solved by most approaches, and is faster than the remaining ones."

Epub 2011 Nov 9.,Turner NJ,J Tissue Eng Regen Med,2013,2011/11/11,,,10.1002/term.508,"Bioprosthetic devices, constructed from a variety of materials, are routinely implanted in a variety of anatomical locations. Essential to their success is the formation of a non-destructive interface with the host tissue and appropriate tissue remodelling. Traditionally, the main method of assessing the host-material interface has been qualitative histological evaluation, using pattern recognition and comparative assessment to identify changes in the normal tissue architecture that are characteristic of scar tissue. In the present study, the recently developed technique of multispectral imaging was used to revisit a little-described histological stain, Herovici's polychrome, which is capable of distinguishing between types I and III collagen. Combined, these techniques allowed quantification of collagen content and distribution of collagen types within a tissue sample. Samples of rat tail and human scar tissue were used to optimize the staining, while comparison with immunolabelled samples was used to develop a reproducible quantification system, based on the specific colour profiles for types I and III collagen. Finally the remodelling of rat abdominal wall defects repaired with crosslinked or non-crosslinked extracellular matrix scaffolds derived from porcine urinary bladder was assessed with this technique. Compared to standard histological assessment, the combination of multispectral imaging and Herovici's polychrome staining presents a quick, simple, reliable technique that can provide accurate quantification of tissue remodelling and specifically identify the expression and distribution of types I and III collagen."

However, the current computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems for classification between malignant and nevus lesions using the ABCD criteria are imperfect due to use of ineffective computerized techniques. METHODS: In this study, a novel melanoma recognition system (MRS) is presented by focusing more on extracting features from the lesions using ABCD criteria. The complete MRS system consists of the following six major steps: transformation to the CIEL*a*b* color space, preprocessing to enhance the tumor region, black-frame and hair artifacts removal, tumor-area segmentation, quantification of feature using ABCD criteria and normalization, and finally feature selection and classification. RESULTS: The MRS system for melanoma-nevus lesions is tested on a total of 120 dermoscopic images. To test the performance of the MRS diagnostic classifier, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) is utilized. The proposed classifier achieved a sensitivity of 88.2%, specificity of 91.3%, and AUC of 0.880. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results show that the proposed MRS system can accurately distinguish between malignant and benign lesions. The MRS technique is fully automatic and can easily integrate to an existing CAD system. To increase the classification accuracy of MRS, the CASH pattern recognition technique, visual inspection of dermatologist, contextual information from the patients, and the histopathological tests can be included to investigate the impact with this system."

In addition to TDP-43-positive neuronal and glial inclusions, C9ORF72-linked FTLD-TDP has characteristic TDP-43-negative neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions as well as dystrophic neurites in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These lesions are immunopositive for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding proteins, such as sequestosome-1/p62 and ubiquilin-2. Studies examining the frequency of the C9ORF72 mutation in clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) have found a small proportion of AD cases with the mutation. This prompted us to systematically explore the frequency of Alzheimer-type pathology in a series of 17 FTLD-TDP cases with mutations in C9ORF72 (FTLD-C9ORF72). We identified four cases with sufficient Alzheimer-type pathology to meet criteria for intermediate-to-high-likelihood AD. We compared AD pathology in the 17 FTLD-C9ORF72 to 13 cases of FTLD-TDP linked to mutations in the gene for progranulin (FTLD-GRN) and 36 cases of sporadic FTLD (sFTLD). FTLD-C9ORF72 cases had higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage than FTLD-GRN. Increased tau pathology in FTLD-C9ORF72 was assessed with thioflavin-S fluorescent microscopy-based neurofibrillary tangle counts and with image analysis of tau burden in temporal cortex and hippocampus. FTLD-C9ORF72 had significantly more neurofibrillary tangles and higher tau burden compared with FTLD-GRN. The differences were most marked in limbic regions. On the other hand, sFTLD and FTLD-C9ORF72 had a similar burden of tau pathology. These results suggest FTLD-C9ORF72 has increased propensity for tau pathology compared to FTLD-GRN, but not sFTLD. The accumulation of tau as well as lesions immunoreactive for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding proteins (p62 and ubiquilin-2) suggests that mutations in C9ORF72 may involve disrupted protein degradation that favors accumulation of multiple different proteins."

Epub 2012 Oct 22.,Hughes C,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,2013,2012/11/13,,,10.1109/TBME.2012.2225835,"No current imaging technique is capable of detecting with precision tumors in the prostate. To evaluate each technique, the histology data must be precisely mapped to the imaged data. As the histology slices cannot be assumed to be cut along the same plane as the imaged data were acquired, the registration must be considered as a 3-D problem. This requires the prior alignment of the histology slices. We propose a protocol in which three needles are inserted into the fresh prostate, creating internal fiducial markers visible in the histology slices. Our algorithm then automatically detects and identifies these markers, enabling the automatic rigid alignment of each slice. The accuracy of the algorithm was quantified in simulated images, a beef liver sample in which a validation marker had been created, and ten prostate specimens. The simulated images showed that the algorithm has no associated residual error for a situation where there is no deformation. In the beef liver images, the average accuracy of the alignment was 0.12 +/- 0.09 mm at the fiducial markers, and 0.62 +/- 0.46 mm at a validation marker positioned approximately 20 mm from the fiducial markers. Concerning the ten prostates, there were 19.2 histology slices on average per specimen. On average, 93.7% of the fiducial markers created were visible in the slices, of which 96.1% were then automatically and correctly detected and identified, enabling an alignment of average accuracy 0.18 +/- 0.13 mm at the fiducial markers. As a cancer of volume <0.5 cm(3) is classified as clinically insignificant, the accuracy achieved justified the choice of a rigid registration. An attractive feature of this method is the time required, less than 6 min on average per prostate specimen."

This process is currently performed manually by highly trained operators and is characterized as a laborious task with low success rate. Therefore, automation is desired to increase the efficiency and consistency of the operations. This research offers a contribution to this procedure through the development of a vision system for a robotic microinjection setup. Its goals are to automatically locate adherent cells in a culture dish and target them for a microinjection. Here the major concern was the achievement of an error-free targeting system to guarantee high consistency in microinjection experiments. To accomplish this, a novel visual targeting algorithm integrating different image processing techniques was proposed. This framework employed defocusing microscopy to highlight cell features and improve cell segmentation and targeting reliability. Three main image processing techniques, operating at three different focus levels in a bright field (BF) microscope, were used: an anisotropic contour completion (ACC) method, a local intensity variation background-foreground classifier, and a grayscale threshold-based segmentation. The proposed framework combined information gathered by each of these methods using a validation map and this was shown to provide reliable cell targeting results. Experiments conducted with sets of real images from two different cell lines (CHO-K1 and HEK), which contained a total of more than 650 cells, yielded flawless targeting results along with a cell detection ratio greater than 50%."

To eliminate interobserver variations on diagnoses and help doctors providing correct treatments, the authors developed an objective computer-aided diagnostic scheme without requiring manually selecting representative images for diagnosis. METHODS: About 112 histological-proven lesions including 66 benign and 46 malignant tumors were involved as the material database. Suspicious lesions were automatically segmented on the first B-mode images on each captured dynamic elastography. Tissue strains inside lesions on elastograms were classified by utilizing the fuzzy c-means algorithm. In order to reduce the influence of image quality, important tumor characteristics were computed from every strain images in elastography and regressed to a probability of being malignant. Since tumor boundaries changed slightly between adjacent slices, a tumor boundary tracking scheme based on template matching was applied on slices excepting the first one. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value are 85.71% (96∕112), 86.96% (40∕46), 84.85% (56∕66), 80.00% (40∕50), and 90.32% (56∕62). In addition, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.9016. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' proposed study provides a reliable computer-aided system which helps physicians to make diagnoses according to features computed from entire elastographic sequence. Experimental results illustrate that the diagnostic scheme is sufficient in distinguishing benign and malignant tumors. It is not necessary for physicians to spend a lot of time to determine the most suitable image for diagnosis. The tumor boundary tracking mechanism effectively eliminates the computation time since it slightly adjusts tumor boundaries between neighboring slices instead of segmenting the tumor contour on each image in the dynamic elastography. The system sufficiently reduces the variations of diagnosis caused by operator dependencies and image qualities and furthermore save physicians' workloads."

Typically, 3D patient-specific arterial models are reconstructed by interpolating between cross sectional contour data which have a certain axial sampling, or image, resolution. The influence of the axial sampling resolution on computed stresses, as well as the comparison of 3D with 2D simulations, is quantified in this study. A set of histological data of four atherosclerotic human coronary arteries was used which were reconstructed in 3D with a high sampling (HS) and low sampling (LS) axial resolution, and 4 slices were treated separately for 2D simulations. Stresses were calculated using finite element analysis (FEA). High stresses were found in thin cap regions and regions of thin vessel walls, low stresses were found inside the necrotic cores and media and adventitia layers. Axial sampling resolution was found to have a minor effect on general stress distributions, peak plaque/cap stress locations and the relationship between peak cap stress and minimum cap thickness. Axial sampling resolution did have a profound influence on the error in computed magnitude of peak plaque/cap stresses (+/-15.5% for HS vs. LS geometries and +/-24.0% for HS vs. 2D geometries for cap stresses). The findings of this study show that axial under sampling does not influence the qualitative stress distribution significantly but that high axially sampled 3D models are needed when accurate computation of peak stress magnitudes is required."

OBJECTIVE: To compare acoustic radiation force impulse imaging with biopsy results in the evaluation of liver fibrosis in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with chronic liver disease and healthy children underwent acoustic radiation force impulse imaging liver measurements. ARFI gives a shear-wave velocity corresponding to tissue elasticity. In 39 children with liver disease, the values obtained were correlated with biopsy results. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the reliability of ARFI in estimating liver fibrosis in children. RESULTS: ARFI mean value was 1.12 in the healthy group and 1.99 in children with chronic liver disease. ROC curves show that an ARFI cutoff of 1.34 m/s is predictive of both METAVIR and SSS scores with a sensitivity of SSS > 2:0.85; METAVIR > F0:0.82. A cutoff of 2 m/s yielded a sensitivity of 100% to detect SSS > 4 or METAVIR > F2. CONCLUSION: Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging is a reliable, noninvasive and rapid method to estimate moderate to severe liver fibrosis in children. It might prove useful to clinicians for fibrosis monitoring in children with liver disease and postpone the time of liver biopsy."

Recent studies using intravoxel incoherent motion-derived parameters did not show differences for structural diffusion constant D between these 2 diseases. The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that D correlates with the histopathological grade of fibrosis in pancreatic lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 15 patients with histopathologically proven pancreatic carcinoma and 9 patients with histopathologically proven focal chronic pancreatitis. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed using 10 b values between 25 and 800 s/mm(2) before surgery. We calculated the apparent diffusion coefficient and the intravoxel incoherent motion-derived parameters D and f within tumors and focal chronic pancreatitis. The resected tissue was evaluated with regard to the grade of fibrosis. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were found to have moderate fibrosis and 10 patients had severe fibrosis. The difference between the D values for the moderate and severe fibrosis was significant with mean (SD) D value of 1.02 x 10(-)(3) (0.48 x 10(-)(3) mm/s) and mean (SD) D of 1.22 x 10(-)(3) (0.76 x 10(-)(3)) mm(2)/s. There were no significant differences for the f and ADC values. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, D rises from moderate to severe fibrosis. It seems that cellular complexes surrounded by fibrosis provide more structural limitations than does fibrosis alone. Our data suggest that D is not intuitively related to the degree of fibrosis. Compared with healthy tissue, D is reduced in moderate fibrosis but increases when severe fibrosis is present."

Previous studies propose textural and morphological features for such systems. These features capture patterns in histological images that are useful for both cancer grading and subtyping. However, because many of these features lack a clear biological interpretation, pathologists may be reluctant to adopt these features for clinical diagnosis. METHODS: We examine the utility of biologically interpretable shape-based features for classification of histological renal tumor images. Using Fourier shape descriptors, we extract shape-based features that capture the distribution of stain-enhanced cellular and tissue structures in each image and evaluate these features using a multi-class prediction model. We compare the predictive performance of the shape-based diagnostic model to that of traditional models, i.e., using textural, morphological and topological features. RESULTS: The shape-based model, with an average accuracy of 77%, outperforms or complements traditional models. We identify the most informative shapes for each renal tumor subtype from the top-selected features. Results suggest that these shapes are not only accurate diagnostic features, but also correlate with known biological characteristics of renal tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Shape-based analysis of histological renal tumor images accurately classifies disease subtypes and reveals biologically insightful discriminatory features. This method for shape-based analysis can be extended to other histological datasets to aid pathologists in diagnostic and therapeutic decisions."

We aimed to compare, for the first time, atrophy patterns, as well as white matter tract degeneration, between these two syndromes. METHODS: Sixteen primary progressive apraxia of speech subjects were age- and gender-matched to 16 progressive supranuclear palsy subjects and 20 controls. All subjects were prospectively recruited, underwent neurological and speech evaluations and 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Grey and white matter atrophy was assessed using voxel-based morphometry and atlas-based parcellation, and white matter tract degeneration was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging. RESULTS: All progressive supranuclear palsy subjects had typical oculomotor/gait impairments, but none had speech apraxia. Both syndromes showed grey matter loss in supplementary motor area, white matter loss in posterior frontal lobes and degeneration of the body of the corpus callosum. Whilst lateral grey matter loss was focal, involving superior premotor cortex, in primary progressive apraxia of speech, loss was less focal extending into prefrontal cortex in progressive supranuclear palsy. Caudate volume loss and tract degeneration of superior cerebellar peduncles were also observed in progressive supranuclear palsy. Interestingly, area of the midbrain was reduced in both syndromes compared to controls, although this was greater in progressive supranuclear palsy. CONCLUSIONS: Although neuroanatomical differences were identified between these distinctive clinical syndromes, substantial overlap was also observed, including midbrain atrophy, suggesting these two syndromes may have common pathophysiological underpinnings."

Epub 2012 Oct 29.,Stachs A,Ultraschall Med,2013,2012/10/31,,,10.1055/s-0032-1313168,"PURPOSE: We compared strain ratio vs. qualitative elastography for the further differentiation of focal breast lesions, with special focus on limiting factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 215 patients with 224 histologically proven breast masses (116 malignant, 108 benign) were prospectively examined using a high-end ultrasound system (Philips iU22) with serial elastography function. B-mode scans and available mammograms were reviewed according to the BIRADS classification, raw elastogram data was analyzed qualitatively using the Tsukuba score and semiquantitatively by calculating the strain ratio (fat to lesion ratio). For diagnostic performance, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was obtained. A sub-group analysis regarding breast density, lesion size, lesion depth and histological subtypes was performed. RESULTS: Mean strain ratio values were 3.04 +/- 0.9 for malignant and 1.91 +/- 0.75 for benign lesions (p < 0,001). The areas under the ROC curve values were 0.832 (95 % CI 0.777; 0.888) for strain ratio, 0.869 (95 % CI 0.822; 0.917) for Tsukuba score, 0.822 (95 % CI 0.768; 0.876) for B-mode ultrasound and 0.853 (95 % CI 0.799; 0.907) for mammography. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the strain ratio were 90.7 %, 58.2 %, 70.3 % and 85.1 %, when a cutoff point of 2.0 was used. Only lesion depth </= 4 mm was associated with diagnostic failure in the multivariate analysis of factors influencing accuracy, whereas no significant correlation between breast density and lesion size and the accuracy of the strain ratio could be found. CONCLUSION: The addition of strain ratio to B-mode ultrasound increases specificity without loss of sensitivity in differentiating between malignant and benign breast tumors. Strain ratio measurements should not be carried out on tumors with a lesion depth </= 4 mm."

METHODS: Perpendicular central corneal volume scans from healthy volunteers were obtained via laser in vivo confocal microscopy. The layer in each volume scan that contained the nerve plexus was detected by applying software operators to analyze image features on the basis of their size, shape, and contrast. Dendritic immune cells were detected in the nerve image on the basis of cellular size, lack of elongation, and brightness relative to the nerves. Images that were 20 mum anterior to the best nerve layer images were used for the analysis of epithelial wing cells; wing cell detection was based on extended regional minima and a watershed transformation. RESULTS: The software successfully detected the best nerve layer images in 15 scans from 15 eyes. Manual and automatic analyses were 81.8% in agreement for dendritic immune cells (for 11 cells in a representative image) and 94.4% in agreement for wing cells (for 466 cells in the image). Within 10 seconds per scan, the software calculated the number, mean length, and mean density of immune cells; the number, mean size, and mean density of wing cells; and the number and mean length of nerves. Factors defining the shape and position of cells and nerves also were available. CONCLUSIONS: The software rapidly and accurately analyzed the in vivo confocal micrographs of the healthy central corneas, yielding quantitative results to describe the nerves, dendritic immune cells, and wing cells."

METHODS: One hundred twelve patients with cervical cancer and 67 control subjects underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in addition to routine MR imaging at 3.0-T MRI before therapy. All ADCs were calculated from b = 0, 600 s/mm(2) and b = 0, 1,000 s/mm(2). RESULTS: The ADCs of cervical cancer were significantly lower than those of normal cervix for both ADC maps. There was a statistically significant difference between the ADCs of well-/moderately differentiated (G1/2) tumours and poorly differentiated (G3) tumours, between the ADCs of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, between the pretherapy ADCs of tumour recurrence or metastasis and tumour free patients after radical hysterectomy for both ADC maps. There was no significant difference among the ADCs of cervical cancer when divided by other features (FIGO, lymph node status, tumour size and age groups) for both ADC maps. CONCLUSION: ADC values were reliable for differentiating cervical cancer from normal cervix with high diagnostic accuracy. The ADCs can be used to indicate the degree and histological type of cervical cancer, although there is some overlap. G3 tumours and lower ADCs may indicate poor prognosis. The diagnostic accuracy was equal for both ADC maps."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging with b-values of 0 and 500 s/mm(2) before the Whipple procedure. Two radiologists independently recorded the ADC values of the tumour and benign pancreas for all cases. ADC values were compared with histopathological findings following the Whipple procedure. RESULTS: The intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.689 for benign pancreas and 0.695 for tumours, indicating good inter-reader agreement for ADC values. The mean ADC value was significantly lower in tumours than in benign pancreas for both readers (reader 1: 1.74 +/- 0.34 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s versus 2.08 +/- 0.48 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively, p = 0.006; reader 2: 1.69 +/- 0.41 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s versus 2.11 +/- 0.54 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively, p < 0.001).

The area under the curve (AUC) for differentiation of poorly and well/moderately differentiated tumours was 0.611 and 0.596 for readers 1 and 2, respectively, and was not significantly better than an AUC of 0.500 for either reader (p >/= 0.306). In addition, ADC was not significantly different for either reader between tumours with stage T3 versus stage T1/T2, between tumours with and without metastatic peri-pancreatic lymph nodes, or between tumours located in the pancreatic head versus other pancreatic regions (p >/= 0.413). CONCLUSION: No associations between ADC values of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and tumour grade or other adverse pathological features were observed."

Histopathological studies found malignant cells in macroscopically unsuspicious brain parenchyma remote from the primary tumor, even affecting the contralateral hemisphere. In early stages, diffuse interneural infiltration with changes of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) is suspected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of DTI as a possible instrument of depicting evidence of tumor invasion into the corpus callosum (CC). Preoperatively, 31 patients with high-grade brain tumors (8 AA and 23 GBM) were examined by MRI at 3 T, applying a high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequence. ADC- and FA-values were analyzed in the tumor-associated area of the CC as identified by fiber tracking, and were compared to matched healthy controls. In (MR-)morphologically normal appearing CC the ADC values were elevated in the tumor patients (n = 22; 0.978 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) compared to matched controls (0.917 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, p < 0.05), and the corresponding relative FA was reduced (rFA: 88 %, p < 0.01). The effect was pronounced in case of affection of the CC visible on MRI (n = 9; 0.978 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, p < 0.05; rFA: 72 %, p < 0.01). Changes in diffusivity and anisotropy in the CC can be interpreted as an indicator of tumor spread into the contralateral hemisphere not visible on conventional MRI."

Model trachea scaffolds with variable wall thickness, interconnected pores, and various degrees of porosity were designed. Photocurable polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer was used with 3D photocuring technology. Thermoplastic polylactide (PLA) and PCL were used with FDM. Cell cultivations were performed for biocompatibility studies. RESULTS: Scaffolds of various sizes and porosities were successfully produced. Both thermoplastic PLA and PCL and photocurable PCL could be used effectively with additive manufacturing technologies to print high-quality tubular porous biodegradable structures. Optical microscopic and SEM images showed the viability of cells. The cells were growing in multiple layers, and biocompatibility of the structures was shown."

Epub 2013 Mar 7.,Rastogi A,Histopathology,2013,2013/03/09,,,10.1111/his.12070,"AIMS: To correlate cirrhosis histology and Laennec fibrosis scoring with portal pressure, as determined by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and four patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis and known HVPG were included in the study. Semiquantitative scoring of 12 histological parameters and quantitative assessment by morphometry for septal thickness and nodule diameter and image analysis for fibrosis were performed. Laennec histological subgrading and clinical staging of cirrhosis were also performed. There were significant positive correlations between HVPG and Laennec histological grade of cirrhosis (P < 0.001), micronodularity (P < 0.001), the presence of thick fibrous septa (P = 0.015), the amount of collagen in the space of Disse (P < 0.001), and the extent of fibrosis by image analysis (P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis, to predict high HVPG (>/=16 mmHg), showed that degree of collagen in the space of Disse [P = 0.007, odds ratio (OR) 19.3], histological grade of cirrhosis (P = 0.017, OR 3.9) and micronodularity (P = 0.02, OR 3.5) independently predicted high HVPG. CONCLUSIONS: Histological subclassification of cirrhosis, collagen in the space of Disse and micronodularity are independent predictors of high portal pressure. The Laennec histological subclassification of cirrhosis correlates well with clinical severity of cirrhosis, and can provide useful prognostic information."

The main clinical, neuroimaging, and pathologic features of these lesions are described according to the last updated classification of the World Health Organization for central nervous system tumors. We provide some useful clues, based on the direct correlation of the imaging appearance with its gross pathologic and histologic appearance, for a comprehensive diagnostic approach. Embryonic tumors (medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor), cavernoma, lymphoma, hemangioblastoma, and ganglionic and mixed tumors as long as lesions affecting the central nervous system by external compression (arising from the skull, cerebrospinal fluid spaces, or extraaxial nervous and vascular elements) are included.

To circumvent the problems inherent in comparing VBM data in vivo with tissue samples that must generally be obtained post-mortem, we chose to consider GABAA receptors, measured using (18)F-flumazenil PET (18F-FMZ-PET), as non-invasive neural markers to be compared with VBM data. Consistent with previous cortical thickness findings, GABAA receptor binding potential (BPND) was found to correlate positively across regions with grey matter (GM) density. These findings confirm that there is a general positive relationship between MRI-based GM density measures and GABAA receptor BPND on a region-by-region basis (i.e., regions with more GM tend to also have higher BPND)."

Although novel optical microscopy methods have been developed to probe cellular features beyond the diffraction limit, nanometer-scale quantification remains still inaccessible for in situ tissue. Here we demonstrate that, without actually resolving specific geometrical feature, OCT can be sensitive to tissue structural properties at the nanometer length scale. The statistical mass-density distribution in tissue is quantified by its autocorrelation function modeled by the Whittle-Matern functional family. By measuring the wavelength-dependent backscattering coefficient mub(lambda) and the scattering coefficient mus, we introduce a technique called inverse spectroscopic OCT (ISOCT) to quantify the mass-density correlation function. We find that the length scale of sensitivity of ISOCT ranges from ~30 to ~450 nm. Although these sub-diffractional length scales are below the spatial resolution of OCT and therefore not resolvable, they are nonetheless detectable. The sub-diffractional sensitivity is validated by 1) numerical simulations; 2) tissue phantom studies; and 3) ex vivo colon tissue measurements cross-validated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, the 3D imaging capability of ISOCT is demonstrated with ex vivo rat buccal and human colon samples."

However, one of the main limitations of the VH-IVUS relates to its dependence to the Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a robust image-based approach for characterization of the plaques using IVUS images. The proposed method consists of three main steps of (1) shadow detection: as an efficient preprocessing step to identify and remove acoustic shadow regions; (2) feature extraction: a combination of gray-scale based features and textural descriptors; and (3) classification: to classify each pixel into one of the three classes (calcium, necrotic core and fibro-fatty). In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm two in-vivo and ex-vivo data sets are considered. The kappa values of 0.639 on in-vivo and 0.628 on ex-vivo tests with VH-IVUS and the histology images labeled by the experts respectively indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

We demonstrate the application of our method to segmenting nuclei from a variety of imaging modalities, and quantitatively compare our results to several other methods. Quantitative results using both simulated and real image data show that, while certain methods may work well for certain imaging modalities, our software is able to obtain high accuracy across several imaging modalities studied. Results also demonstrate that, relative to several existing methods, the template-based method we propose presents increased robustness in the sense of better handling variations in illumination, variations in texture from different imaging modalities, providing more smooth and accurate segmentation borders, as well as handling better cluttered nuclei."

METHODS: From April 2008 to April 2012, 21 patients with biopsy or clinically proven juxtapleural pulmonary tuberculomas underwent contrast-enhanced sonography with an intravenous bolus injection of 4.8 mL of a sulfur hexafluoride-filled microbubble contrast agent. Enhancement patterns and functional parameters (time to enhancement, time to peak enhancement, and peak signal intensity) derived from a time-intensity curve were evaluated. Enhancement patterns were correlated with their histologic findings. RESULTS: A rim enhancement pattern was presented in 12 (57.1%), a homogeneous enhancement pattern in 5 (23.8%), and a heterogeneous enhancement pattern in 4 (19.1%) of 21 tuberculomas. A pathologic study confirmed that the nonenhancing center of the rim enhancement pattern corresponded to caseous or liquefied necrosis, and homogeneously enhanced portions corresponded to granulomatous inflammation. The medians (25th-75th interquartile ranges) for the time to enhancement, time to peak enhancement, and peak signal intensity were 14 seconds (9-14 seconds), 22 seconds (21-26 seconds), and 83 dB (55-92 dB), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced sonography of juxtapleural pulmonary tuberculoma is feasible. Juxtapleural pulmonary tuberculomas usually show rim, homogeneous, or heterogeneous enhancement. Enhancement patterns of juxtapleural pulmonary tuberculomas are well correlated with their pathologic features."

The pathologic diagnosis of RPOC is made based on the presence of chorionic villi, which indicates persistent placental or trophoblastic tissue. In the setting of postpartum hemorrhage, however, distinguishing RPOC from bleeding related to normal postpartum lochia or uterine atony can be clinically challenging. Ultrasonographic (US) evaluation can be particularly helpful in these patients, and a thickened endometrial echo complex (EEC) or a discrete mass in the uterine cavity is a helpful gray-scale US finding that suggests RPOC. However, gray-scale US findings alone are inadequate for accurate diagnosis. Detection of vascularity in a thickened EEC or an endometrial mass at color or power Doppler US increases the positive predictive value for the diagnosis of RPOC. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful when US findings are equivocal and typically demonstrates an enhancing intracavitary mass in patients with RPOC. Diagnostic pitfalls are rare but may include highly vascular RPOC, which can be mistaken for a uterine arteriovenous malformation; true arteriovenous malformations of the uterus; invasive moles; blood clot; and subinvolution of the placental implantation site."

The grating-based x-ray interferometry technique can produce absorption, differential phase contrast (DPC) and scattering signals of the sample, in parallel, and works well with conventional X-ray sources; thus, it constitutes a promising method for more reliable breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Recently, our team proved that this novel technology can provide images superior to conventional mammography. This new technology was used to image whole native breast samples directly after mastectomy. The images acquired show high potential, but the noise level associated to the DPC and scattering signals is significant, so it is necessary to remove it in order to improve image quality and visualization. The noise models of the three signals have been investigated and the noise variance can be computed. In this work, a wavelet-based denoising algorithm using these noise models is proposed. It was evaluated with both simulated and experimental mammography data. The outcomes demonstrated that our method offers a good denoising quality, while simultaneously preserving the edges and important structural features. Therefore, it can help improve diagnosis and implement further post-processing techniques such as fusion of the three signals acquired."

Tedious manual assessment of immunohistochemically stained tissue needs to be fully automated to take full advantage of the potential for high throughput analyses enabled by tissue microarrays and digital pathology. Such automated tools also need to be reproducible for different experimental conditions and biomarker targets. In this study we present a novel supervised melanoma specific pattern recognition approach that is fully automated and quantitative. METHODS AND RESULTS: Melanoma samples were immunostained for the melanocyte specific target, Melan-A. Images representing immunostained melanoma tissue were then digitally processed to segment regions of interest, highlighting Melan-A positive and negative areas. Color deconvolution was applied to each region of interest to separate the channel containing the immunohistochemistry signal from the hematoxylin counterstaining channel. A support vector machine melanoma classification model was learned from a discovery melanoma patient cohort (n = 264) and subsequently validated on an independent cohort of melanoma patient tissue sample images (n = 157). CONCLUSION: Here we propose a novel method that takes advantage of utilizing an immuhistochemical marker highlighting melanocytes to fully automate the learning of a general melanoma cell classification model. The presented method can be applied on any protein of interest and thus provides a tool for quantification of immunohistochemistry-based protein expression in melanoma."

A cube beamsplitter splits the object wave into two copies within the two arms. The reference wave is rebuilt by low-pass filtering with a pinhole-masked mirror. Both object and reference waves are split into two beams by a grating in a 4f imaging system; thus, two interferograms with quadrature phase-shift can be acquired simultaneously with the aid of polarization elements. The approach has the merit of nanometers-scale phase stability over hours due to its quasi-common-path geometry. It can make full use of camera spatial bandwidth while its temporal resolution is as fast as the camera frame rate. Phase imaging on microscale specimen is implemented, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is suitable for investigating dynamic processes."

Epub 2012 Oct 6.,Filipe JP,MAGMA,2013,2012/10/12,,,10.1007/s10334-012-0348-1,"OBJECT: By measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of liver parenchyma and focal hepatic lesions (FHL) we proposed to investigate the utility of ADC in the differential diagnosis of hepatic disease and to determine the influence of region of interest (ROI) characteristics in those measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with at least one supracentimetric FHL, or parenchymal abnormality, were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnosis was based on histopathologic data or, alternatively, on a combination of consensus between imaging methods and 24 months of follow-up. Ninety lesions were evaluated with respiratory-triggered diffusion-weighted imaging (b values: 50 and 700 s/mm(2)): 14 hepatocellular carcinomas, 18 metastases, 10 focal nodular hyperplasias, four adenomas, 30 hemangiomas and 14 cysts. ADC of hepatic parenchyma was measured by placing ROIs in four different segments, and in FHLs by using three circular 1 cm(2) ROIs and one ROI encompassing the full lesion. Data was statistically analyzed (p < 0.05 considered significant), and a receiver operating characteristic curve was assessed to evaluate the accuracy for the diagnosis of malignancy. RESULTS: Our measurements showed that parenchyma ADC was significantly higher in segment II and that ADCs of malignant lesions were significantly lower than those of benign lesions (p < 0.001). There was significant overlap between benign solid lesions and malignant lesions and the area under the curve for malignancy was 0.939 (sensitivity 89.7 %, specificity 90.6 %), using a cutoff of 1.43 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. No significant difference was found between ROIs of different characteristics. CONCLUSION: ADC measurements can help to characterize FHLs and differentiate normal from pathological parenchyma. Any ROI above 1 cm(2) can provide accurate ADC measurements in homogenous lesions."

Epub 2013 Jan 11.,Gavrilovic M,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2013,2013/01/17,,,10.1109/TMI.2013.2239655,"Cancer diagnosis is based on visual examination under a microscope of tissue sections from biopsies. But whereas pathologists rely on tissue stains to identify morphological features, automated tissue recognition using color is fraught with problems that stem from image intensity variations due to variations in tissue preparation, variations in spectral signatures of the stained tissue, spectral overlap and spatial aliasing in acquisition, and noise at image acquisition. We present a blind method for color decomposition of histological images. The method decouples intensity from color information and bases the decomposition only on the tissue absorption characteristics of each stain. By modeling the charge-coupled device sensor noise, we improve the method accuracy. We extend current linear decomposition methods to include stained tissues where one spectral signature cannot be separated from all combinations of the other tissues' spectral signatures. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that our method results in more accurate decompositions than methods based on non-negative matrix factorization and independent component analysis. The result is one density map for each stained tissue type that classifies portions of pixels into the correct stained tissue allowing accurate identification of morphological features that may be linked to cancer."

Many different methods (algorithms) have been suggested for its solution. In this paper we present a software package, SNARK09, for reconstruction of 2D images from their 1D projections. In the area of image reconstruction, researchers often desire to compare two or more reconstruction techniques and assess their relative merits. SNARK09 provides a uniform framework to implement algorithms and evaluate their performance. It has been designed to treat both parallel and divergent projection geometries and can either create test data (with or without noise) for use by reconstruction algorithms or use data collected by another software or a physical device. A number of frequently-used classical reconstruction algorithms are incorporated. The package provides a means for easy incorporation of new algorithms for their testing, comparison and evaluation. It comes with tools for statistical analysis of the results and ten worked examples."

23986328,Catalogue of tooth brush head designs,"Voelker MA, Bayne SC, Liu Y, Walker MP.",J Dent Hyg. 2013 Jun;87(3):118-33.,Voelker MA,J Dent Hyg,2013,2013/08/30,,,,"PURPOSE: Manual toothbrushes (MTBs) and power toothbrushes (PTBs) are effective oral physiotherapy aids for plaque removal. End-rounded bristles are safer and reduce damage to oral tissues. Nylon bristles are more effective in plaque removal because the bristle is stiffer than natural bristles. In the last 10 years the number of options for MTBs and PTBs has expanded significantly and there is very little information providing a reference frame for the design characteristics of the heads. The present in vitro study characterized a variety of MTB and PTB heads to provide a reference library for other research comparisons which might be made. METHODS: Various commercial MTB and PTB heads were used to characterize the following: bristle size, shape, diameter, number of tufts, number of bristles per tuft and surface characteristics. Photographs were collected from the side, at 45 degrees and the top of each toothbrush (TB) head using a scanning electron microscope and digital camera. Images were analyzed (Soft Imaging System) for bristle features and designs. One-way ANOVA (p </= 0.05) was performed to detect differences among TB types within MTB and PTB groups and between pooled values for MTB and PTB groups. RESULTS: There were significant differences (p </= 0.05) in toothbrush bristle diameter and bristle shape. In contrast, there were no significant differences between PTB vs. MTB in regards to bristle diameter, bristle count and tuft count. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that although there are wide variations in toothbrush head designs, significant differences were found only in relation to bristle diameter and shape."

To fill gaps in our understanding, regional differences in the adult human pancreas were quantitatively analyzed including the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cadaveric pancreas specimens were collected from the head, body and tail regions of each donor, including subjects with no history of diabetes or pancreatic diseases (n = 23) as well as patients with T2D (n = 12). The study further included individuals from whom islets were isolated (n = 7) to study islet yield and function in a clinical setting of islet transplantation. The whole pancreatic sections were examined using an innovative large-scale image capture and unbiased detailed quantitative analyses of the characteristics of islets from each individual (architecture, size, shape and distribution). Islet distribution/density is similar between the head and body regions, but is >2-fold higher in the tail region. In contrast to rodents, islet cellular composition and architecture were similar throughout the pancreas and there was no difference in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets isolated from different regions of the pancreas. Further studies revealed preferential loss of large islets in the head region in patients with T2D. The present study has demonstrated distinct characteristics of the human pancreas, which should provide a baseline for the future studies integrating existing research in the field and helping to advance bi-directional research between humans and preclinical models."

TDI within the diseased human brain has not been previously described. The purpose of this study was to correlate TDI with histopathologic features of GBM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 43 tumor specimens (24 contrast-enhancing, 12 NE, and 7 centrally necrotic regions) were collected from 18 patients with treatment-naive GBM by use of MR imaging-guided neurosurgical techniques. Immunohistochemical stains were used to evaluate the following histopathologic features: hypoxia, architectural disruption, microvascular hyperplasia, and cellular proliferation. We reconstructed track density maps at a 0.25-mm isotropic spatial resolution by using probabilistic streamline tractography combined with constrained spheric deconvolution (model order, 8; 0.1-mm step size; 1 million seed points). Track density values were obtained from each tissue site. A P value of .05 was considered significant and was adjusted for multiple comparisons by use of the false discovery rate method. RESULTS: Track density was not significantly different between contrast-enhancing and NE regions but was more likely to be elevated within regions demonstrating aggressive histopathologic features (P < .05). Significant correlation between relative track density and hypoxia (odds ratio, 3.52; P = .01), architectural disruption (odds ratio, 3.49; P = .03), and cellular proliferation (odds ratio, 1.70; P = .05) was observed irrespective of the presence or absence of contrast enhancement. CONCLUSIONS: Numeric values of track density correlate with GBM biologic features and may be clinically useful for identification of regions of tumor infiltration within both enhancing and NE components of GBM."

Seventy male Wistar rats given a single intra-peritoneal injection of DMN and 10 control rats given a saline injection underwent SWEI and RTE to determine their shear wave velocity (V(s)) and liver fibrosis (LF) index, respectively. Correlations between V(s) or the LF index and histologic stage of liver fibrosis (S0-S4) were analyzed, and the diagnostic values of the techniques were assessed using a receiver operating characteristic curve. A positive correlation was found between V(s) and stage of liver fibrosis (r = 0.947, p < 0.001) and between LF index and stage (S) of liver fibrosis (r = 0.662, p < 0.001). For Vs, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnosis of fibrosis, S >/= S1, S >/= S2, S >/= S3 and S = S4, were 0.983, 0.995, 0.999 and 0.964, respectively; for the LF index, the values were 0.871, 0.887, 0.761 and 0.839, respectively (all p < 0.001). Vs and the LF index values in rats with severe inflammatory activity were significantly higher than those in controls (p < 0.001). In conclusion, positive correlations exist between V(s) or the LF index and the severity of liver fibrosis in rats. Vs is more accurate than the LF index in predicting liver fibrosis in rats. However, severe inflammatory activity may reduce the accuracy of both techniques."

Histology shows abnormalities in the dentate granule cell layer (DGCL), but its small size (~100 mum thickness) has precluded in vivo human studies. We used ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare DGCL morphology of schizophrenic patients to matched controls. METHOD: Bilateral hippocampi of 16 schizophrenia patients (10 male) 40.7 +/- 10.6 years old (mean +/- standard deviation) were imaged at 7 Tesla MRI with heavily T(2)*-weighted gradient-echo sequence at 232 mum in-plane resolution (0.08 muL image voxels). Fifteen matched controls (8 male, 35.6 +/- 9.4 years old) and one ex vivo post mortem hippocampus (that also underwent histopathology) were scanned with same protocol. Three blinded neuroradiologists rated each DGCL on a qualitative scale of 1 to 6 (from ""not discernible"" to ""easily visible, appearing dark gray or black"") and mean left and right DGCL scores were compared using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: MRI identification of the DGCL was validated with histopathology. Mean right and left DGCL ratings in patients (3.2 +/- 1.0 and 3.5 +/- 1.2) were not statistically different from those of controls (3.9 +/- 1.1 and 3.8 +/- 0.8), but patients had a trend for lower right DGCL score (p = 0.07), which was significantly associated with patient diagnosis (p = 0.05). The optimal 48% sensitivity and 80% specificity for schizophrenia were achieved with a DGCL rating of </=2. CONCLUSION: Decreased contrast in the right DGCL in schizophrenia was predictive of schizophrenia diagnosis. Better utility of this metric as a schizophrenia biomarker may be achieved in future studies of patients with homogeneous disease subtypes and progression rates."

Eleven P-MCs (nine patients) were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Three experts assessed these sonographic images using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon. For assessment of internal echoes and posterior echoes, quantitative measures were determined using ImageJ software. Histologic thin sections were stained for classification into separate parts of the tumor (stroma, mucin and cancer cells) and were digitized. Internal echoes were isoechoic in 7 of 11 (63.6%) tumors and hypoechoic in 4 of 11 (36.4%); all P-MCs were ""enhanced"" in qualitative evaluation. As internal echoes increased, the proportion of stroma increased and that of mucin decreased. The high level of internal echoes is correlated with reflection and back-scattering, which are caused mainly by the interface between mucin and stroma."

Advances in microscopy have enabled a shift towards non-invasive in vivo microscopy techniques such as reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) in this context. Computational image analysis of RCM images has the potential to be of use in the non-invasive assessment of photoageing. In this report, we computationally characterized a clinical RCM data set from younger and older Caucasians with varying levels of photoageing. We identified several mathematical relationships that related to the degree of photoageing as assessed by conventional scoring approaches (clinical photography, SCINEXA and RCM). Furthermore, by combining the mathematical features into a single computational assessment score, we observed significant correlations with conventional RCM (P < 0.0001) and the other clinical assessment techniques."

Phase-shaping to achieve selective excitation of the FPs in combination with post-imaging linear unmixing enables clean separation of the fluorescence signal of each FP. This setup also benefits from low overall cost and simple optical alignment, enabling easy adaptation in a regular biomedical research laboratory."

Microglia respond to a multitude of soluble molecules produced by a variety of brain cells. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a cytokine found in the brain whose receptor is expressed by microglia. Previous studies suggest a critical role for M-CSF in brain development and normal functioning as well as in several disease processes involving neuroinflammation. METHODS: Using biopsy tissue from patients with intractable temporal epilepsy and autopsy tissue, we cultured primary adult human microglia to investigate their response to M-CSF. Mixed glial cultures were treated with 25 ng/ml M-CSF for 96 hours. Proliferation and phagocytosis assays, and high through-put immunocytochemistry, microscopy and image analysis were performed to investigate microglial phenotype and function. RESULTS: We found that the phenotype of primary adult human microglia was markedly changed following exposure to M-CSF. A greater number of microglia were present in the M-CSF- treated cultures as the percentage of proliferating (BrdU and Ki67-positive) microglia was greatly increased. A number of changes in protein expression occurred following M-CSF treatment, including increased transcription factors PU.1 and C/EBPbeta, increased DAP12 adaptor protein, increased M-CSF receptor (CSF-1R) and IGF-1 receptor, and reduced HLA-DP, DQ, DR antigen presentation protein. Furthermore, a distinct morphological change was observed with elongation of microglial processes. These changes in phenotype were accompanied by a functional increase in phagocytosis of Abeta1-42 peptide. CONCLUSIONS: We show here that the cytokine M-CSF dramatically influences the phenotype of adult human microglia. These results pave the way for future investigation of M-CSF-related targets for human therapeutic benefit."

In the present case, the optical system is a microscope containing a halogen lamp, with a nonuniform irradiance on the viewed surface. The calibration method proposed in this work is based on an existing method, but it is preceded by a three-step preprocessing of the RGB images aiming at extracting relevant color information from the strongly distorted images, taking especially into account the nonuniform irradiance map and the perturbing texture due to the surface topology of the standard color calibration charts when observed at micrometric scale. The proposed color calibration process consists first in computing the average color of the color-chart patches viewed under the microscope; then computing white balance, gamma correction, and saturation enhancement; and finally applying a third-order polynomial regression color calibration transform. Despite the nonusual conditions for color calibration, fairly good performance is achieved from a 48 patch Lambertian color chart, since an average CIE-94 color difference on the color-chart colors lower than 2.5 units is obtained."

Filopodia play crucial roles in processes such as development and wound-healing. Also, increases in filopodia number or size are characteristic of many invasive cancers and are correlated with increased rates of metastasis in mouse experiments. Thus, one possible route to developing anti-metastatic therapies is to target factors that influence the filopodia system. Filopodia can be detected by eye using confocal fluorescence microscopy, and they can be manually annotated in images to quantify filopodia parameters. Although this approach is accurate, it is slow, tedious and not entirely objective. Manual detection is a significant barrier to the discovery and quantification of new factors that influence the filopodia system. RESULTS: Here, we present FiloDetect, an automated tool for detecting, counting and measuring the length of filopodia in fluorescence microscopy images. The method first segments the cell from the background, using a modified triangle threshold method, and then extracts the filopodia using a series of morphological operations. We verified the accuracy of FiloDetect on Rat2 and B16F1 cell images from three different labs, showing that per-cell filopodia counts and length estimates are highly correlated with the manual annotations. We then used FiloDetect to assess the role of a lipid kinase on filopodia production in breast cancer cells. Experimental results show that PI4KIII beta expression leads to an increase in filopodia number and length, suggesting that PI4KIII beta is involved in driving filopodia production. CONCLUSION: FiloDetect provides accurate and objective quantification of filopodia in microscopy images, and will enable large scale comparative studies to assess the effects of different genetic and chemical perturbations on filopodia production in different cell types, including cancer cell lines."

The light source had a sweep rate of 280 kHz, providing a bidirectional axial scan rate of 560 kHz. The sweep bandwidth was 117 nm centered at 1310 nm, corresponding to an axial resolution of 13.1 microm in air, corresponding to 8.1 microm (9.6 microm spectrally shaped) in tissue. Dispersion mismatch from different objectives was compensated numerically, enabling magnification and field of view to be easily changed. OCM images were acquired with transverse resolutions between 0.86 microm - 3.42 microm using interchangeable 40X, 20X and 10X objectives with ~600 microm x 600 microm, ~1 mm x 1 mm and ~2 mm x 2 mm field-of-view (FOV), respectively. Parasitic variations in path length with beam scanning were corrected numerically. These features enable swept source OCM to be integrated with a wide range of existing scanning microscopes. Large FOV mosaics were generated by serially acquiring adjacent overlapping microscopic fields and combining them in post-processing. Fresh human colon, thyroid and kidney specimens were imaged ex vivo and compared to matching histology sections, demonstrating the ability of OCM to image tissue specimens."

METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010 we treated 69 patients (71 lesions) by elective carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and 35 patients (36 lesions) by CAS. All patients underwent preoperative MR plaque imaging and the ratio of plaque signal intensity to the sternocleidomastoid muscle was calculated. In the CEA group, we categorized the histopathological findings made on the surgical specimens. In the CAS group, we assessed the post-procedure diffusion-weighted images. RESULTS: PMR index panels for each plaque type were created using the cut-off value obtained from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of each plaque type. The probability of each of the four plaque types on each panel was assessed by Fisher's exact test. Multinomial logistic regression analysis of the DWI-positive findings determined significant probability (p=0.042). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest quantitative evaluation using the PMR index panel has a probability to predict both the plaque type and risk of embolism in patients being considered for treatment with CAS."

In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) reproducible imaging technique already reported to be useful in the diagnosis of skin diseases. The aims of our study were to define RCM features of MF and to evaluate its feasibility in biopsy site selection. METHODS: Each lesion was selected for RCM evaluation from 10 patients with an established diagnosis of MF. Subsequently, a biopsy of the same areas evaluated with RCM was rendered for histopathological examination. RESULTS: A series of RCM features of MF was identified and shown to correlate well with histopathological evaluation. We could find hyperkeratosis in five patients (10 : 50%); disarray of honeycomb of stratum spinosum in three patients (10 : 30%). In 10 patients (10 : 100%) of the MF, we could find that dermal papillary rings were weak reflected light; round to oval cells diffusely widespread throughout the epidermis and in the papillary dermis, infiltration of inflammatory cells in superficial dermis. Two (10 : 20%) of them can find vesicle area opaca in plaque stage MF, filled with monomorphous weakly refractile oval to round cells. CONCLUSION: The utility of RCM as a diagnostic tool for MF awaits further evaluation, although it appears to be promising for biopsy site selection."

Epub 2013 May 5.,Qin YY,Neuroradiology,2013,2013/05/07,,,10.1007/s00234-013-1195-0,"INTRODUCTION: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been applied to characterize the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a mouse model, although little is known about whether these features are structure specific. Voxel-based analysis (VBA) and atlas-based analysis (ABA) are good complementary tools for whole-brain DTI analysis. The purpose of this study was to identify the spatial localization of disease-related pathology in an AD mouse model. METHODS: VBA and ABA quantification were used for the whole-brain DTI analysis of nine APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (WT) controls. Multiple scalar measurements, including fractional anisotropy (FA), trace, axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR), were investigated to capture the various types of pathology. The accuracy of the image transformation applied for VBA and ABA was evaluated by comparing manual and atlas-based structure delineation using kappa statistics. Following the MR examination, the brains of the animals were analyzed for microscopy. RESULTS: Extensive anatomical alterations were identified in APP/PS1 mice, in both the gray matter areas (neocortex, hippocampus, caudate putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, claustrum, amygdala, and piriform cortex) and the white matter areas (corpus callosum/external capsule, cingulum, septum, internal capsule, fimbria, and optic tract), evidenced by an increase in FA or DA, or both, compared to WT mice (p < 0.05, corrected). The average kappa value between manual and atlas-based structure delineation was approximately 0.8, and there was no significant difference between APP/PS1 and WT mice (p > 0.05). The histopathological changes in the gray matter areas were confirmed by microscopy studies. DTI did, however, demonstrate significant changes in white matter areas, where the difference was not apparent by qualitative observation of a single-slice histological specimen. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the structure-specific nature of pathological changes in APP/PS1 mouse, and also showed the feasibility of applying whole-brain analysis methods to the investigation of an AD mouse model."

PAD produces a progressive accumulation of ischemic injury to the legs, manifested as a gradual degradation of gastrocnemius histology. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that quantitative morphological parameters of gastrocnemius myofibers change in a consistent manner during the progression of PAD, provide an objective grading of muscle degeneration in the ischemic limb, and correlate to a clinical stage of PAD. Biopsies were collected with a Bergstrom needle from PAD patients with claudication (n = 18) and critical limb ischemia (CLI; n = 19) and control patients (n = 19). Myofiber sarcolemmas and myosin heavy chains were labeled for fluorescence detection and quantitative analysis of morphometric variables, including area, roundness, perimeter, equivalent diameter, major and minor axes, solidity, and fiber density. The muscle specimens were separated into training and validation data sets for development of a discriminant model for categorizing muscle samples on the basis of disease severity. The parameters for this model included standard deviation of roundness, standard deviation of solidity of myofibers, and fiber density. For the validation data set, the discriminant model accurately identified control (80.0% accuracy), claudicating (77.7% accuracy), and CLI (88.8% accuracy) patients, with an overall classification accuracy of 82.1%. Myofiber morphometry provided a discriminant model that establishes a correlation between PAD progression and advancing muscle degeneration. This model effectively separated PAD and control patients and provided a grading of muscle degeneration within clinical stages of PAD."

The study consists of three main stages: (1) DATA ACQUISITION: light microscopic images were obtained from 60 rats separated into 10 groups after the preparation of liver tissue samples for histological examination. Rats in first five experimental groups for the four-day and the other five groups for twenty-day were examined. (2) Data processing: by the help of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) method, obtaining low-dimensional image features (color, shape and texture) and classifying five different group characteristics by using these features with artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) have been provided. (3) Calculation of drug effectiveness: firstly to determine the differences between group characteristics of rats, a pilot group has been selected (diseased group-CCl4), and the responses of ANN and SVM trained by HOG features have been calculated. As a result of ANN, it has been seen that melatonin and resveratrol drugs have %65.62-%75.12 positive effects at the end of the fourth day, %84.12-%98.89 positive effects on healing steatosis hepatis at the end of the twentieth day respectively and as a result of SVM, it has been seen that melatonin and resveratrol drugs have %62.5-%68.75 positive effects at the end of the fourth day, %45.12-%60.89 positive effects on healing steatosis hepatis at the end of the twentieth day respectively."

For 15 infertile men with various sperm profiles, high-magnification microscopy was used to select motile, morphometrically normal spermatozoa with no vacuoles (n=450) or more than two small vacuoles (each of which occupied less than 4% of the head's area; n=450). Spermatozoa acrosome reaction status and degree of chromatin condensation were analysed. Three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy was used to accurately image the nucleus and acrosome at all depths in all spermatozoa. In all 450 spermatozoa with small vacuoles, the latter were seen to be abnormal, DNA-free nuclear concavities. Spermatozoa with small vacuoles were significantly more likely than vacuole-free spermatozoa to have noncondensed chromatin (39.8% versus 9.3%, respectively; P<0.0001). There was no significant difference between the two groups of spermatozoa in terms of acrosome reaction status. No association between chromatin condensation and acrosome reaction status was observed. Small human sperm vacuoles observed under high magnification are pocket-like nuclear concavities related to failure of chromatin condensation."

METHODS: Comparisons were made between 10 eyes from patients with vascular comorbidities and 17 control eyes. All eyes were absent of clinically evident ocular disease. Microcannulation techniques were used to label the retinal microvasculature. Retinae were flat mounted, and the peripapillary region 2 mm nasal to the fovea was imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Two- and three-dimensional image reconstructions were used to perform quantitative measurements of individual capillary networks within the perifovea. Parameters measured included capillary diameter, capillary loop area, capillary loop length, capillary density, and capillary surface area. RESULTS: Capillary diameter was increased in the retinal ganglion cell and superficial inner plexiform layer capillary network in patients with vascular comorbidities. Capillary loop area and capillary loop length were reduced in all capillary networks in patients with vascular comorbidities except the deep capillary network of the inner nuclear layer. Capillary density was reduced in the nerve fiber layer capillary network in patients with vascular comorbidities. There was no difference in the relative occupied capillary surface area between control and diseased eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The results in this study suggest that the quantitative characteristics of perifoveal capillary networks are nonuniformly altered in patients with vascular comorbidities, before the onset of clinically identifiable eye diseases. These findings may be important for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms involved in retinal vascular diseases."

Epub 2012 Mar 7.,Yilgor P,J Tissue Eng Regen Med,2013,2012/03/08,,,10.1002/term.1456,"The hypothesis of this study was that the extent of bone regeneration could be enhanced by using scaffolds with appropriate geometry, and that such an effect could be further increased by mimicking the natural timing of appearance of bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-2 and BMP-7 after fracture. Bioplotted poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) disks with four different fibre organizations were used to study the effect of 3D scaffold architecture on the healing of bone defects in a rat pelvis model. Moreover, one PCL construct was further modified by introducing a nanoparticulate sequential BMP-2/BMP-7 delivery system into this scaffold. Scaffolds and functionalized construct along with free nanocapsules were implanted using a rat iliac crest defect model. Six weeks post-implantation, the defects were evaluated by CT scan and histology. Analysis revealed that the basic architecture, having the highest pore volume for tissue ingrowth, presented the highest bone formation as determined by the bone mineral density (BMD) within the defect (144.2 +/- 7.1); about four-fold higher than that of the empty defect (34.9 +/- 10.7). It also showed the highest histological analysis scores with a high amount of bone formation within the defect, within the scaffold pores and along the outer surfaces of the scaffold. The basic scaffold carrying the BMP-2/BMP-7 delivery system showed significantly higher bone formation than the growth factor-free basic scaffold at 6 weeks (BMD 206.8 +/- 15.7). Histological analysis also revealed new bone formation in close to or in direct contact with the construct interface. This study indicates the importance of open and interconnecting pore geometry on the better healing of bone defects, and that this effect could be further increased by supplying growth factors, as is the case in nature."

Epub 2013 Mar 27.,Jiang L,Eur J Radiol,2013,2013/04/02,,,10.1016/j.ejrad.2013.03.006,"PURPOSE: To investigate the association between non-mass type breast cancer and common clinical-pathological prognostic factors, compared with mass type breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional review board approval, retrospective blind review of contrast-enhanced breast MRI was carried out for 88 histologically proven breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients, presenting from January 2008 to December 2011. Two radiologists assessed the images of each lesion for the morphologic enhancement type [mass enhancement or non-mass-like enhancement (NMLE)] and the distribution/internal enhancement of NMLE. Two pathologists evaluated the histological grade of IDC, presence or absence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lymph node status, presence or absence of vascular invasion, and expression status of estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER-2/p53 tumor suppressor gene (p53)/Ki-67. Inter-observer agreement was assessed with kappa test. Chi-square test and Spearman rank correlation were performed to explore the associations of morphologic enhancement type with the age, lesion size and the above pathological prognostic factors RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement was excellent, with kappa>0.75. Morphologic enhancement type was significantly correlated with age (P=0.02), with NMLE more commonly seen in women less than 50 y/o. The size of NMLE was larger than that of mass and, with the increase of lesion size, proportion of NMLE among the cases increased (P=0.001). NMLE was also significantly correlated with low histologic grade of IDC (P=0.003) and presence of DCIS (P<0.001). There was no significant correlation between morphologic enhancement type and lymph node status, vascular invasion, ER/PR/HER-2/p53/Ki-67 status. The histological grade was higher in clumped enhancement than non-clumped (P=0.011). There was no correlation between enhancement distribution and prognostic factors CONCLUSIONS: Non-mass type breast cancer may not necessarily have worse prognosis than the mass type, due to lower histological grade and closely related to DCIS component, although it may has larger tumor size. Clumped enhancement may have worse prognosis than non-clumped enhancement."

With the aim to further reveal the underlying mechanisms and provide new strategies for early cancer diagnostics, we have used ultrahigh resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy as a means to identify metastasizing cells, based on their subcellular protein distribution patterns reflecting their specific adhesive and mechanical properties. We have compared the spatial distribution of cell-matrix adhesion sites and the vimentin filamentous systems in a matched pair of primary, normal, and metastatic human fibroblast cells. We found that the metastatic cells showed significantly increased densities and more homogenous distributions of nanoscale adhesion-related particles. Moreover, they showed an increase in the number but reduced sizes of the areas of cell-matrix adhesion complexes. The organization of the vimentin intermediate filaments was also found to be significantly different in the metastasizing cells, showing an increased entanglement and loss of directionality. Image analysis procedures were established, allowing an objective detection and characterization of these features and distinction of metastatic cells from their normal counterparts. In conclusion, our results suggest that STED microscopy provides a novel tool to identify metastasizing cells from a very sparse number of cells, based on the altered spatial distribution of the cell-matrix adhesions and intermediate filaments."

METHODS: Forty-eight healthy, normal weight, noncontact lens wearers of Asian ethnicity were assessed. Single endothelial images from each subject were processed with center-dot software, reevaluated after correction of obvious errors, and then by manual border marking and planimetry. Endothelial cell density based on average cell area and the coefficient of variation (COV) of cell area (polymegethism) were calculated. RESULTS: Error sources are associated with erroneous location of cell borders (usually creating larger or smaller ""cells"") or failure to assign cell borders to a marked cell. On the initial application of the center-dot software, the endothelial cell density values ranged from 1822 to 3244 cells per square millimeter (mean, 2644 cells/mm); this range was reduced (eg, 1955-3054 cells/mm; mean 2690 cells/mm on editing or in manual planimetry). The COV values ranged from 17% to 39% (mean, 27.5% +/- 5.5%), with one third of the endothelia yielding COV values of greater than or equal to 30%. On editing or in manual planimetry, the COV values were reduced to between 17% and 29% (mean, 24.5% +/- 3.2%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the use of a center-dot endothelial analysis program with cell border identification, it is likely that at least 1 set of editing steps is required to produce reasonable results."

Epub 2013 Jul 4.,Du R,Nephrol Dial Transplant,2013,2013/07/06,,,10.1093/ndt/gft252,"BACKGROUND: Our previous studies demonstrated that URG11 is involved in hypoxia-induced tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the development of kidney fibrosis in cellular and animal models. The objective of this study was to determine the expression levels of URG11 in kidneys with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), and the association of URG11 with various clinical parameters. METHODS: We analysed the degree of expression and localization of URG11 in biopsies from kidneys with IgAN, and correlated their immunostaining levels with various clinical and histological parameters. We also analysed the correlation between the expression of URG11 and Twist in the renal interstitium with renal survival. RESULTS: URG11 was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cells obtained from kidneys of patients with IgAN. However, there was little positive staining for URG11 in the renal tubules of normal kidneys (P = 0.024). URG11 protein levels in the tubulointerstitium were inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) (r = -0.305, P = 0.038) and the percentage of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (r = 0.350, P = 0.023). Moreover, a high level of URG11 correlated with the activation of Twist expression and E-cadherin repression in patients with IgAN (P = 0.000 and 0.041, respectively). Multivariate analyses indicated that a combination of high URG11 and Twist expression was an independent prognostic factor [relative ratio, RR 4.738 (95% CI: 1.040, 21.591), P = 0.044] of IgAN. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that URG11 staining in renal biopsy specimens might be a novel histological marker for progression in IgAN patients."

It functions as a regulator of metabolism. Diseases involving the thyroid range from benign to malignant and can be associated with major morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound (US) imaging of the thyroid gland is prompted because of a palpable mass on clinical examination; abnormality of thyroid function tests; incidental finding on other imaging modalities, that is, nuclear scintigraphy or computed tomography scan; screening for patients with risk factors for malignancy, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type II; or prior neck radiation treatment.Ultrasound is an excellent, noninvasive, and cost-effective diagnostic tool in the detection and characterization of thyroid disease. Most thyroid diseases have pathognomonic features on US, which are of diagnostic importance and lead to appropriate clinical management. Ultrasound plays an important role in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid disease, thereby triaging patients for US-guided fine-needle aspiration. Ultimately, thyroid US, in conjunction with thyroid function tests, can aid in characterizing various thyroid diseases.The main objective of this pictorial essay is to illustrate the sonographic appearance of various benign and malignant diseases of the thyroid with their histopathology correlations. Management of thyroid nodules using US-guided fine-needle aspiration is also briefly discussed."

For diagnosis, predicting the outcome of the disease, and for assessing potential new biomarkers, pathologists and researchers routinely analyze histological samples. Morphological and molecular information may be integrated by aligning microscopic histological images in a multiplex fashion. This process is usually time-consuming and results in intra- and inter-user variability. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using modern image analysis methods for automated alignment of microscopic images from differently stained adjacent paraffin sections from prostatic tissue specimens. METHODS: Tissue samples, obtained from biopsy or radical prostatectomy, were sectioned and stained with either hematoxylin & eosin (H&E), immunohistochemistry for p63 and AMACR or Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) for androgen receptor (AR). Image pairs were aligned allowing for translation, rotation and scaling. The registration was performed automatically by first detecting landmarks in both images, using the scale invariant image transform (SIFT), followed by the well-known RANSAC protocol for finding point correspondences and finally aligned by Procrustes fit. The Registration results were evaluated using both visual and quantitative criteria as defined in the text. RESULTS: Three experiments were carried out. First, images of consecutive tissue sections stained with H&E and p63/AMACR were successfully aligned in 85 of 88 cases (96.6%). The failures occurred in 3 out of 13 cores with highly aggressive cancer (Gleason score >/= 8). Second, TRF and H&E image pairs were aligned correctly in 103 out of 106 cases (97%).The third experiment considered the alignment of image pairs with the same staining (H&E) coming from a stack of 4 sections. The success rate for alignment dropped from 93.8% in adjacent sections to 22% for sections furthest away. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is both reliable and fast and therefore well suited for automatic segmentation and analysis of specific areas of interest, combining morphological information with protein expression data from three consecutive tissue sections. Finally, the performance of the algorithm seems to be largely unaffected by the Gleason grade of the prostate tissue samples examined, at least up to Gleason score 7."

Various animal models have been used in experimental studies for the analysis of individual and class characteristics. However, human tissue has seldom been used and it is likely to differ from that of non-humans in key aspects. This study wishes to assess how the knife's blade angle, and both intra- and inter-individual variation in cartilage samples affect the ability of costal cartilage to retain the original class characteristics of the knife, as measured microscopically by the distance between consecutive striations. The 120 cartilaginous samples used in this study originated from the ribcage of 6 male cadavers which were submitted to autopsy at the North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine, in Portugal. Three different serrated knives were purchased from a large department store, and were used in the experimental cuts. Samples of costal cartilage from 2 individuals were assigned to each knife. Each individual provided 20 cartilage samples. Cartilage samples were manually cut using each of the three knives, following two motions: one straight up-and-down cutting motion and parallel and one perpendicular to the blade's teeth long axis forward cutting motion. Casts of the samples were made with Mikrosil((R)). Image capture and processing were performed with an Olympus stereomicroscope and its software. The blade's penetration angle and inter-individual variation were shown to affect the identification of the tool class characteristics from the striation pattern observed in a kerf wall, although this seems to be related only to the degree of calcification of the costal cartilage. Intra-individual variation does not seem to significantly affect the identification of the tool class characteristics from the striation pattern observed in a kerf wall, for the same knife following the same motion. Although this study did not quantify the degree of calcification of the cartilage, this seems to be an important source of great variation regarding the interpretation of striation pattern in cartilage."

Epub 2012 Dec 12.,Kleinnijenhuis M,Cortex,2013,2013/01/26,,,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.11.015,"One of the most prominent characteristics of the human neocortex is its laminated structure. The first person to observe this was Francesco Gennari in the second half the 18th century: in the middle of the depth of primary visual cortex, myelinated fibres are so abundant that he could observe them with bare eyes as a white line. Because of its saliency, the stria of Gennari has a rich history in cyto- and myeloarchitectural research as well as in magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy. In the present paper we show for the first time the layered structure of the human neocortex with ex vivo diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). To achieve the necessary spatial and angular resolution, primary visual cortex samples were scanned on an 11.7 T small-animal MR system to characterize the diffusion properties of the cortical laminae and the stria of Gennari in particular. The results demonstrated that fractional anisotropy varied over cortical depth, showing reduced anisotropy in the stria of Gennari, the inner band of Baillarger and the deepest layer of the cortex. Orientation density functions showed multiple components in the stria of Gennari and deeper layers of the cortex. Potential applications of layer-specific diffusion imaging include characterization of clinical abnormalities, cortical mapping and (intra)cortical tractography. We conclude that future high-resolution in vivo cortical DWI investigations should take into account the layer-specificity of the diffusion properties."

The use of (near) infrared light in MPM allows for deep tissue imaging. In addition, this modality exploits the autofluorescent nature of extracellular matrix fibres within the skin. OBJECTIVES: To quantitate the structure and abundance of elastic fibres in human dermis in three dimensions utilizing autofluorescent signals generated by MPM for the objective examination of elastin-related skin disorders. METHODS: Cross-sections of skin samples from elastin-related disorders were analysed by MPM and correlated to histopathology. In situ visualization of elastic fibres by MPM was conducted by en face imaging of ex vivo skin samples through the intact epidermis. Image analysis software was used to quantify elastic fibres in three dimensions. RESULTS: Based on the MPM-detected elastin-specific autofluorescence, we developed the Dermal Elastin Morphology Index (DEMI), calculated as the ratio of elastic fibre surface area and volume. This enabled objective three-dimensional quantification of elastic fibres. Quantitative scoring of sun-damaged skin using DEMI correlated with qualitative histopathological grading of the severity of solar elastosis. Furthermore, this approach was applied to changes in elastic fibre architecture in other disorders, such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), PXE-like syndrome, elastofibroma, focal dermal elastosis, anetoderma, mid-dermal elastolysis and striae distensae. We imaged elastic fibres in intact ex vivo skin imaged en face through the epidermis, indicating that this approach could be used in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: MPM has the potential for noninvasive in vivo visualization of elastic fibres in the dermis with near histological resolution. DEMI allows objective assessment of elastic fibres to support diagnosis and monitoring of disease progress or therapy of elastin-related skin disorders."

Epub 2013 Jun 21.,Liu X,Magn Reson Imaging,2013,2013/06/25,,,10.1016/j.mri.2013.03.002,"PURPOSE: To investigate biexponential apparent diffusion parameters of prostate central gland (CG) cancer, stromal hyperplasia (SH), and glandular hyperplasia (GH) and compare with monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value for discriminating prostate cancer from benign hyperplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one CG cancer foci, 23 SH and 26 GH nodules in the CG were analyzed in 39 patients (19 with CG cancer, 20 with peripheral zone cancer but no CG cancer) who underwent preoperative conventional DWI (b-value 0, 1000s/mm(2)) and a 10 b-value (range 0 to 3000s/mm(2)) DWI. All of the cancer and hyperplastic foci on MR images were localized on the basis of histopathologic correlation. The ADC value of the monoexponential DWI, and the fast apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCf), slow apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCs) value and the fraction of ADCf (f) of the biexponential DWI were calculated for all of the lesions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for the differentiation of CG cancer from SH and GH. RESULTS: The ADC values (x10(-3)mm(2)/s) were 0.87+/-0.11, 1.06+/-0.15, and 1.61+/-0.27 in CG cancer, SH and GH foci, respectively, and differed significantly, yielding areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 1.00 and 0.80 for the differentiation of carcinoma from GH and SH, respectively. The ADCf (x10(-3)mm(2)/s), ADCs (x10(-3)mm(2)/s) and f for cancer were 1.92+/-0.38, 0.53+/-0.17, and 47.7+/-6.1%, respectively, which were lower than the same values for GH (3.43 +/-0.65, 1.12+/-0.21, 61.1+/-8.7%) (all p<0.01). The ADCf and ADCs for cancer were also lower than those for SH (3.11+/-0.30, 0.79+/-0.21) (all p<0.01). The ADCf yielded AUCs (1.00, p>0.01) that were comparable to those from ADC for the differentiation of cancer from GH, while ADCf yielded higher AUCs (0.92) compared with ADC (p<0.01) for the differentiation of cancer from SH. ADCs and f revealed AUCs of 0.97 and 0.90, respectively, for the differentiation of cancer from GH, and the ADCs offered relatively lower AUCs (0.68) for differentiating cancer from SH. CONCLUSION: Biexponential DWI could potentially improve the differentiation of prostate cancer in CG, and the ADCf of the biexponential model offers better accuracy than ADC."

The overlap between these patterns is a function of the number of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) formed in replication sites. The goal of this study was to optimize a method of quantitative assessment of a degree of correlation between these two patterns. Such a correlation can be used to estimate a probability of inducing damage in sections of replicating DNA. The damage and replication foci are imaged in 3D with confocal microscopy and their respective positions within nuclei are determined with adaptive image segmentation. Using correlation functions spatial proximity of the resultant point patterns is quantified over the range of distances in cells in early-, mid- and late S-phase. As the numbers (and nuclear densities) of gammaH2AX and replication foci differ significantly in the subsequent substages of S phase, the detected association values were corrected for the expected random overlap between both classes of foci. Thus, the probability of their nonrandom association was estimated. Moreover, self association (clustering) of DNA replication sites in different stages of S-phase of the cell cycle was detected and accounted for. While the analysis revealed a strong correlation between the gammaH2AX foci and the sites of DNA replication in cells treated with Cpt, only a low correlation was apparent in cells exposed to H2O2.

The objective of this study was to analyse SWI and CE-SWI characteristics, i.e. the relationship between contrast-induced phase shifts (CIPS) and intratumoral susceptibility signals (ITSS) and their association with tumour volume in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI studies of 29 patients were performed to evaluate distinct susceptibility signals comparing SWI and CE-SWI characteristics. The relationship between these susceptibility signals and CE-T1w tumour volume was analysed by using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Kruskal-Wallis-test. Tumour biopsies of different susceptibility signals were performed in one patient. RESULTS: Comparison of SWI and CE-SWI demonstrated different susceptibility signals. Susceptibility signals visible on SWI images are consistent with ITSS; those only seen on CE-SWI were identified as CIPS. Correlation with CE-T1w tumour volume revealed that CIPS were especially present in small or medium-sized GBM (Spearman's rho r = 0.843, P < 0.001). Histology identified the area with CIPS as the tumour invasion zone, while the area with ITSS represented micro-haemorrhage, highly pathological vessels and necrosis. CONCLUSION: CE-SWI adds information to the evaluation of GBM before therapy. It might have the potential to non-invasively identify the tumour invasion zone as demonstrated by biopsies in one case. KEY POINTS: * MRI is used to help differentiate between low- and high-grade gliomas. * Contrast-enhanced susceptibility-weighted MRI (CE-SWI) helps to identify patients with glioblastoma multiforme. * CE-SWI delineates the susceptibility signal (CIPS and ITSS) more than the native SWI. * CE-SWI might have the potential to non-invasively identify the tumour invasion zone."

We sought to determine whether confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) provides sufficient information to identify neoplasia in breast tissue. Breast tissue specimens were imaged following proflavine application. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected in histologic slides and in the corresponding region on confocal images, and then divided into sets for training and validation. Readers reviewed images in the training set and evaluated images in the validation set for the presence of neoplasia. Accuracy was assessed using histologic diagnosis as the gold standard. Seventy tissue specimens from 31 patients were imaged; 235 ROIs were identified and diagnosed as neoplastic or non-neoplastic. A training set was assembled using 23 matched ROIs; 49 matched ROIs were assembled into a validation set. Neoplasia was identified in histologic images: 93% sensitivity, 97% specificity [area under the curve (AUC=0.987)] and in confocal images: 93% sensitivity 93% specificity (AUC=0.957). CFM produced images of architectural features in breast tissue comparable with conventional histology, while requiring little processing. Potential applications include assessment of excised tissue margins and evaluation of tissue adequacy for bio-banking and genomic studies."

In this study we identified areas of abnormal cortical thinning within the cerebral cortex of ASD individuals and examined the same for neuronal morphometric abnormalities by using computerized image analysis. RESULTS: The study analyzed celloidin-embedded and Nissl-stained serial full coronal brain sections of 7 autistic (ADI-R diagnosed) and 7 age/sex-matched neurotypicals. Sections were scanned and manually segmented before implementing an algorithm using Laplace's equation to measure cortical width. Identified areas were then subjected to analysis for neuronal morphometry. Results of our study indicate the presence within our ASD population of circumscribed foci of diminished cortical width that varied among affected individuals both in terms of location and overall size with the frontal lobes being particularly involved. Spatial statistic indicated a reduction in size of neurons within affected areas. Granulometry confirmed the presence of smaller pyramidal cells and suggested a concomitant reduction in the total number of interneurons. CONCLUSIONS: The neuropathology is consistent with a diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Results from the medical literature (e.g., heterotopias) and our own study suggest that the genesis of this cortical malformation seemingly resides in the heterochronic divisions of periventricular germinal cells. The end result is that during corticogenesis radially migrating neuroblasts (future pyramidal cells) are desynchronized in their development from those that follow a tangential route (interneurons). The possible presence of a pathological mechanism in common among different conditions expressing an autism-like phenotype argue in favor of considering ASD a ""sequence"" rather than a syndrome. Focal cortical dysplasias in ASD may serve to explain the high prevalence of seizures and sensory abnormalities in this patient population."

METHODS: Orchiectomy specimens of 37 consecutive patients were imaged by FFDM. Detected foci of calcification were stratified as: type 1, dense microcalcification; type 2, faint microcalcification; type 3, macrocalcification. Histopathology identified the tumour types, the presence of intratubular germ cell neoplasia (IGCN) and associated calcifications. Orchiography results correlated with the histopathology. RESULTS: On orchiography, 32/37of the specimens (86 %) had co-existing foci of calcification. Histopathology results revealed foci of calcification in 23/37 (62 %) of orchiectomy specimens. Of the 20 IGCN cases, 80 % presented with calcifications on orchiography. Fifty-six percent (14/25) of type 1, 70 % (12/17) of type 2, and 30 % (2/6) of type 3 foci of calcification were observed in IGCN-positive cases. CONCLUSION: This study classifies the morphology of testicular tumour calcification in three main groups by digital orchiography. In half of the testicular cancers, histopathologically proven IGCN is also found in addition to the index tumour. Type 2 foci of microcalcification detected by orchiography may be related to IGCN and may prompt further clinical assessment. KEY POINTS: * Orchiography can detect and classify calcification in 86 % of testicular cancers. * Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (IGCN) co-exists in 54 % of testicular cancers. * Type 2 foci of microcalcification detected by orchiography may be related to IGCN. * Orchiography may play a possible future role in the diagnosis of testicular IGCN."

Histopathological and in vivo labeling studies demonstrate that this loss occurs most extensively in the caudal putamen and caudate head. Previous structural studies have suggested reduced striatal volume and atrophy of the caudate head in PD subjects. The spatial distribution of atrophy in the putamen, however, has not been characterized. We aimed to delineate the specific locations of atrophy in both of these striatal structures. T1- and T2-weighted brain MR (3T) images were obtained from 40 PD and 40 control subjects having no dementia and similar age and gender distributions. Shape analysis was performed using doubly segmented regions of interest. Compared to controls, PD subjects had lower putamen (p = 0.0003) and caudate (p = 0.0003) volumes. Surface contraction magnitudes were greatest on the caudal putamen (p </= 0.005) and head and dorsal body of the caudate (p </= 0.005). This spatial distribution of striatal atrophy is consistent with the known pattern of dopamine depletion in PD and may reflect global consequences of known cellular remodeling phenomena."

This problem involves several subproblems and a high accuracy of each step is essential to avoid error propagation. In this paper, we propose a holistic three-component system to tackle this problem. For each phase, we first learn a mean shape as well as a model of the temporal dynamics of transformation, which are used for estimating a shape prior for the cell in the current frame. We then segment the cell using a level set-based shape prior model. Finally, we identify its phase based on the goodness-of-fit of the data to the segmentation model. This phase information is also used for fine-tuning the segmentation result. We evaluate the performance of our method empirically in various aspects and in tracking individual cells from HeLa H2B-GFP cell population. Highly accurate validation results confirm the robustness of our method in many realistic scenarios and the essentiality of each component of our integrating system."

Quantitative interpretation of the deluge of complicated biomedical images, however, poses many research challenges, one of which is to enhance structural features that are scarcely perceptible to the human eye. This study introduces a contrast enhancement approach based on a new type of mathematical morphology called rotational morphological processing. The proposed method is applied to medical images for the enhancement of structural features. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated quantitatively by the contrast improvement ratio (CIR). The CIR of the proposed method is 12.1, versus 4.7 and 0.1 for two conventional contrast enhancement methods, clearly indicating the high contrasting capability of the method."

METHOD: We selected a total of 54 cholesteatoma images, immunohistochemically stained by anti-TNF-R2 (32 slides) and anti-TGF-alpha, (22 slides). The secondary antibody used in the two groups was the Max Polymer Detection System (Novo Link Kit, Novocastra(R), UK). The samples were processed by a digital slide scanner (ScanScope - Aperio). The selected sites were analyzed by photometry. RESULTS: The objective assessment by photometry was compared with the subjective evaluation by three examiners and subjected to statistical analysis. The Statistical analysis revealed moderate reproducibility (K values between 0.41 and 0.60) for both groups. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the irregular characteristics of middle ear cholesteatoma slides stained by immunohistochemistry prevents its proper objective evaluation, while the subjective assessment by experienced examiners was more reliable."

Computerized image analysis can partially overcome these shortcomings due to its capacity to quantitatively and reproducibly measure histologic structures on a large-scale. In this paper, we present an end-to-end image analysis and data integration pipeline for large-scale morphologic analysis of pathology images and demonstrate the ability to correlate phenotypic groups with molecular data and clinical outcomes. We demonstrate our method in the context of glioblastoma (GBM), with specific focus on the degree of the oligodendroglioma component. Over 200 million nuclei in digitized pathology slides from 117 GBMs in the Cancer Genome Atlas were quantitatively analyzed, followed by multiplatform correlation of nuclear features with molecular and clinical data. For each nucleus, a Nuclear Score (NS) was calculated based on the degree of oligodendroglioma appearance, using a regression model trained from the optimal feature set. Using the frequencies of neoplastic nuclei in low and high NS intervals, we were able to cluster patients into three well-separated disease groups that contained low, medium, or high Oligodendroglioma Component (OC). We showed that machine-based classification of GBMs with high oligodendroglioma component uncovered a set of tumors with strong associations with PDGFRA amplification, proneural transcriptional class, and expression of the oligodendrocyte signature genes MBP, HOXD1, PLP1, MOBP and PDGFRA. Quantitative morphologic features within the GBMs that correlated most strongly with oligodendrocyte gene expression were high nuclear circularity and low eccentricity. These findings highlight the potential of high throughput morphologic analysis to complement and inform human-based pathologic review."

In the context of prostate cancer histopathology, gland morphology is an integral component of the Gleason grading system which enables discrimination between low and high grade disease. However, clinicians are often unable to distinguish between subtle differences in object morphology, as evidenced by high inter-observer variability in Gleason grading. Boundary-based morphologic descriptors, such as the variance in the distance from points on the boundary of an object to its center, may not have the requisite discriminability to separate objects with subtle shape differences. In this paper, we present a set of novel explicit shape descriptors (ESDs) which are capable of distinguishing subtle shape differences between prostate glands of intermediate Gleason grades (grades 3 and 4) on prostate cancer histopathology. Calculation of ESDs involves: (1) representing object morphology using an explicit shape model (e.g. medial axis); (2) aligning the shape models via a non-rigid registration scheme with a diffeomorphic constraint and quantifying shape model dissimilarity; and (3) applying a non-linear dimensionality reduction scheme (e.g. Graph Embedding) to learn a low dimensional projection encoding the shape differences between objects. ESDs are hence the principal eigenvectors in the reduced embedding space. In this work we demonstrate that ESDs in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine classifier are able to correctly distinguish between 888 prostate glands corresponding to different Gleason grades (benign, grade 3, or grade 4) of prostate cancer from 58 needle biopsy specimens with a maximum accuracy of 0.89 and corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78."

METHODS: Twenty-five patients with histologically proved brain gliomas (10 low-grade and 15 high-grade) were included in this study. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, non-diffusion weighted b=0 (b0) images, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), CS and CP maps were co-registered and each lesion was divided into two regions of interest (ROI): enhancing and immediate peritumoral edema (edema adjacent to tumor). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine the best classification model. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The best logistic regression model for classification combined three parameters (CS, FA and CP) from the immediate peritumoral part (p=0.02), resulting in 86% sensitivity, 80% specificity and area under the curve of 0.81. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that combined DTI metrics can function in effect as a non-invasive measure to distinguish between low-grade and high-grade gliomas."

Automatic image analysis methods offer the possibility to obtain consistent, objective and rapid diagnoses of histopathology specimens. In breast cancer biopsies immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for ER, cancer cell nuclei present a large variety in their characteristics that bring various difficulties for traditional image analysis methods. In this paper, we propose a new automatic method to perform both segmentation and classification of breast cell nuclei in order to give quantitative assessment and uniform indicators of IHC staining that will help pathologists in their diagnostic. Firstly, a color geometric active contour model incorporating a spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed to detect the contours of all cell nuclei in the image. Secondly, overlapping and touching nuclei are separated using an improved watershed algorithm based on a concave vertex graph. Finally, to identify positive and negative stained nuclei, all the segmented nuclei are classified into five categories according to their staining intensity and morphological features using a trained multilayer neural network combined with Fisher's linear discriminant preprocessing. The proposed method is tested on a large dataset containing several breast tissue images with different levels of malignancy.

This method has been particularly intriguing for melanoma because, unlike other methods available, it can provide nondestructive, quantitative chemical information regarding different types of melanins, with high spatial resolution. In this Letter, we present a method based on mathematical morphology to quantify melanin structure (eumelanin, pheomelanin, and total melanin content, uniquely available with pump-probe microscopy) to aid in melanoma diagnosis. The approach applies a two-dimensional autocorrelation function and utilizes statistical parameters of the corresponding autocorrelation images, specifically, the second moments and entropy, to parameterize image structure. Along with bulk melanin chemical information, we show that this method can differentiate invasive melanomas from noninvasive and benign lesions with high sensitivity and specificity (92.3% and 97.5%, respectively, with N=53). The mathematical method and the statistical analysis are described in detail and results from cutaneous and ocular conjunctival melanocytic lesions are presented."

However, despite progress, robust algorithms for PET and multimodal image segmentation are still lacking, especially if the algorithm were extended to image-guided and adaptive radiotherapy (IGART). This work presents a novel multimodality segmentation algorithm using the Jensen-Renyi divergence (JRD) to evolve the geometric level set contour. The algorithm offers improved noise tolerance which is particularly applicable to segmentation of regions found in PET and cone-beam computed tomography. METHODS: A steepest gradient ascent optimization method is used in conjunction with the JRD and a level set active contour to iteratively evolve a contour to partition an image based on statistical divergence of the intensity histograms. The algorithm is evaluated using PET scans of pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with the corresponding histological reference. The multimodality extension of the algorithm is evaluated using 22 PET/CT scans of patients with lung carcinoma and a physical phantom scanned under varying image quality conditions. RESULTS: The average concordance index (CI) of the JRD segmentation of the PET images was 0.56 with an average classification error of 65%. The segmentation of the lung carcinoma images had a maximum diameter relative error of 63%, 19.5%, and 14.8% when using CT, PET, and combined PET/CT images, respectively. The estimated maximal diameters of the gross tumor volume (GTV) showed a high correlation with the macroscopically determined maximal diameters, with a R(2) value of 0.85 and 0.88 using the PET and PET/CT images, respectively. Results from the physical phantom show that the JRD is more robust to image noise compared to mutual information and region growing. CONCLUSIONS: The JRD has shown improved noise tolerance compared to mutual information for the purpose of PET image segmentation. Presented is a flexible framework for multimodal image segmentation that can incorporate a large number of inputs efficiently for IGART."

METHODS: Fifty patients with classic EDS and 50 age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. A clinical evaluation was made with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and a complete ophthalmic examination, including assessment of the best-corrected visual acuity and refraction, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, tear break-up time, intraocular pressure, Schirmer test without topical anesthesia, and corneal diameter. Scheimpflug camera topography and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) were used to investigate corneal morphology and corneal ultrastructural features respectively. RESULTS: Classic EDS patients, compared to controls, had thinner and steeper corneas (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively; independent samples t-test). IVCM showed thinner stromas, lower keratocyte densities (P < 0.001), increased applanation-related stromal folds (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test), and increased endothelial hyperreflective dots (P < 0.05) in these patients. The study group also had increased symptoms (OSDI score: P < 0.01, independent samples t-test) and signs (tear break-up time and Schirmer test: P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) of tear film dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with classic EDS had macro- and microstructural changes of the cornea, which is a target tissue of the disease. These findings should be considered to optimize clinical management of these patients and to evaluate the opportunity of adding ocular findings to the classic EDS diagnostic criteria."

Useful information on cancer invasiveness hidden within tumor nests could be extracted and analyzed by computer image processing and big data analysis. METHODS: Tissue microarrays from invasive ductal carcinoma (n = 202) were first stained with cytokeratin by immunohistochemical method to clearly demarcate the tumor nests. Then an expert-aided computer analysis system was developed to study the mathematical and geometrical features of the tumor nests. Computer recognition system and imaging analysis software extracted tumor nests information, and mathematical features of tumor nests were calculated. The relationship between tumor nests mathematical parameters and patients' 5-year disease free survival was studied. RESULTS: There were 8 mathematical parameters extracted by expert-aided computer analysis system. Three mathematical parameters (number, circularity and total perimeter) with area under curve >0.5 and 4 mathematical parameters (average area, average perimeter, total area/total perimeter, average (area/perimeter)) with area under curve <0.5 in ROC analysis were combined into integrated parameter 1 and integrated parameter 2, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that integrated parameter 1 (P = 0.040) was independent prognostic factor of patients' 5-year disease free survival. The hazard risk ratio of integrated parameter 1 was 1.454 (HR 95% CI [1.017-2.078]), higher than that of N stage (HR 1.396, 95% CI [1.125-1.733]) and hormone receptor status (HR 0.575, 95% CI [0.353-0.936]), but lower than that of histological grading (HR 3.370, 95% CI [1.125-5.364]) and T stage (HR 1.610, 95% CI [1.026 -2.527]). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated integrated parameter 1 of mathematical features (number, circularity and total perimeter) of tumor nests could be a useful parameter to predict the prognosis of early stage breast invasive ductal carcinoma."

We aimed to assess the performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the diagnosis of FNH-sd. METHODS: Four histologically proven FNH-sd nodules in four patients were investigated with both MRI and CEUS imaging. Sinusoidal dilatation was focally visible in all cases in histology. RESULTS: In MRI, in all the four cases, lesions were hypervascular in arterial phase, with high intensity in T2-weighted sequence imaging and persistent enhancement in the delayed gadolinium-enhanced phase. These MRI features were more indicative of HCA than FNH. On the other hand, CEUS showed a very specific centrifugal filling followed by a strong, homogeneous enhancement of the whole lesion. CONCLUSION: CEUS seems to be an essential step for the diagnosis of non-typical FNH, such as FNH-sd. This small series highlights the interest of performing both CEUS and MRI for the diagnosis of atypical focal liver lesions, such as FNH-sd."

Twelve-day-old S. mutans biofilms in the IP space were exposed to a prototype AirFloss delivering 115 microL water at a maximum exit velocity of 60 m/sec in a 30-msec burst. Using confocal microscopy and image analysis, we obtained quantitative measurements of the percentage removal of biofilms from different locations in the IP space. The 3D geometry of the typodont and the IP spaces was obtained by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging. We performed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to calculate the wall shear stress (tauw ) distribution caused by the drops on the tooth surface. A qualitative agreement and a quantitative relationship between experiments and simulations were achieved. The wall shear stress (tauw ) generated by the prototype AirFloss and its spatial distribution on the teeth surface played a key role in dictating the efficacy of biofilm removal in the IP space."

Addressing the unsolved challenges, the authors propose an interactive cell segmentation scheme over phase retardation features. After partitioning the images into phase homogeneous atoms, human annotations are propagated to unlabeled atoms over an affinity graph that is learned based on discrimination analysis. Then, an active query strategy is proposed for which the most informative unlabeled atom is selected for annotation, which is also propagated to the other unlabeled atoms. Cell segmentation converges to quality results after several rounds of interactions involving both the user's intentions and characteristics of image features. Experimental results demonstrate that cells with different optical properties are well segmented via the proposed approach."

Epub 2013 Nov 13.,Hostetter G,Vet Pathol,2014,2013/11/15,,,10.1177/0300985813510532,"Animal models have historically informed veterinary and human pathophysiology. Next-generation genomic sequencing and molecular analyses using analytes derived from tissue require integrative approaches to determine macroanalyte integrity as well as morphology for imaging algorithms that can extend translational applications. The field of biospecimen science and biobanking will play critical roles in tissue sample collection and processing to ensure the integrity of macromolecules, aid experimental design, and provide more accurate and reproducible downstream genomic data. Herein, we employ animal experiments to combine protein expression analysis by microscopy with RNA integrity number and quantitative measures of morphologic changes of autolysis. These analyses can be used to predict the effect of preanalytic variables and provide the basis for standardized methods in tissue sample collection and processing. We also discuss the application of digital imaging with quantitative RNA and tissue-based protein measurements to show that genomic methods augment traditional in vivo imaging to support biospecimen science. To make these observations, we have established a time course experiment of murine kidney tissues that predicts conventional measures of RNA integrity by RIN analysis and provides reliable and accurate measures of biospecimen integrity and fitness, in particular for time points less than 3 hours post-tissue resection."

Such methods are suitable to investigate human brain tissue and will help to achieve a deeper understanding of brain disease along with aiding drug development. Human brain tissue samples are usually treated postmortem via standard fixation protocols, which are established in clinical laboratories. Therefore, our localization microscopy-based method was adapted to characterize protein density and protein cluster localization in samples fixed using different protocols followed by common fluorescent immunohistochemistry techniques. The localization microscopy allows nanoscopic mapping of serotonin 5-HT1A receptor groups within a two-dimensional image of a brain tissue slice. These nanoscopically mapped proteins can be confined to clusters by applying the proposed statistical spatial analysis. Selected features of such clusters were subsequently used to characterize and classify the tissue. Samples were obtained from different types of patients, fixed with different preparation methods, and finally stored in a human tissue bank. To verify the proposed method, samples of a cryopreserved healthy brain have been compared with epitope-retrieved and paraffin-fixed tissues. Furthermore, samples of healthy brain tissues were compared with data obtained from patients suffering from mental illnesses (e.g., major depressive disorder). Our work demonstrates the applicability of localization microscopy and image analysis methods for comparison and classification of human brain tissues at a nanoscopic level. Furthermore, the presented workflow marks a unique technological advance in the characterization of protein distributions in brain tissue sections."

Experimental CNV was induced in Long Evans rats by laser disruption of the Bruch's membrane. FA was performed weekly for 5weeks. Multi-Otsu thresholding (MOT) was used to quantify CNV in late-phase FA images from both experimental rodent CNV and wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) patients. Images were automatically thresholded into three levels based on the image histogram, with the highest level containing CNV. To determine the technique's ability to quantify CNV areas, rats were given either triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone sodium phosphate to treat CNV and compared to untreated rats. The rat CNV lesion areas measured from 5-week histology sections from each treatment group were compared to areas measured from the corresponding FA images. MOT was able to detect statistical decreases in rodent CNV area in the treatment groups versus control from weeks 3 through 5. The ratio of CNV area measured from histology to area measured from FA images was not statistically different between groups. Finally, to determine the usefulness of MOT on pathological morphologies of CNV, MOT was performed on late-phase FA images from patients with classic and diffuse CNV. The technique was able to segment classical CNV in wAMD patients, but performed poorly with diffuse CNV. MOT provides a robust, objective, and quantifiable area measurement of CNV lesion area in both experimentally-induced and pathological CNV. The results indicate that MOT could be a useful research tool in helping evaluate the effects of therapeutics on CNV growth."

More detailed knowledge of its development is essential to improve our insight into TMJ-OA. It is imperative to have a standardized reliable three-dimensional (3D) imaging method that allows for detailed assessment of both bone and cartilage in healthy and diseased joints. We aimed to determine the applicability of a contrast-enhanced microCT (microCT) technique for ex vivo research of mouse and human TMJs. METHODS: Equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast agent via microCT (EPIC-microCT) was previously applied for cartilage assessment in the knee joint. The method was ex vivo, applied to the mouse TMJ and adapted for the human TMJ. RESULTS: EPIC-microCT (30-min immersion time) was applied to mouse mandibular condyles, and 3D imaging revealed an average cartilage thickness of 110 +/- 16 microm. These measurements via EPIC-microCT were similar to the histomorphometric measures (113 +/- 19 microm). For human healthy OA-affected TMJ samples, the protocol was adjusted to an immersion time of 1 h. 3D imaging revealed a significant thicker cartilage layer in joints with early signs of OA compared with healthy joints (414.2 +/- 122.6 and 239.7 +/- 50.5 microm, respectively). A subsequent significant thinner layer was found in human joints with late signs of OA (197.4 +/- 159.7 microm). CONCLUSIONS: The EPIC-microCT technique is effective for the ex vivo assessment of 3D cartilage morphology in the mouse as well as human TMJ and allows bone-cartilage interaction research in TMJ-OA."

This work demonstrates that not only can samples be accurately detected across a range of sample-sensor separations using LFI, but also that the separation can be accurately estimated based on the shape of fluorescence in the LFI image. First, a theoretical model that accurately predicts LFI images of microspheres is presented. Then, the experimental results are compared to the model and an image processing method for accurately predicting sample-sensor separation from LFI images is presented. Finally, LFI images of microspheres and cells passing through a microfluidic channel are presented."

A questionnaire was developed to survey medical laboratory professionals about their perceptions regarding the benefits and limitations for using digital images in clinical hematology. The questionnaire was sent in March 2012 to an entire list of 81 current CellaVision DM96 (CellaVision AB, Sweden) consumers. A response rate of 46% was obtained. Background information on participants, 5-point Likert scale averages, percentage agreement (strongly agree and agree), and disagreement (strongly disagree and disagree) were calculated and analyzed. The benefits of using the CellaVision DM96 rated the strongest by respondents included: decreased eyestrain, consistency among patient results and advantages in training personnel. Respondents reported notable limitations as being: restrictions with accurately estimating platelets and red cell morphology. Digital image software is currently being utilized in preclinical and clinical hematology and offers potential benefits. With upgrades in slide scanning features and improved capabilities to view platelet and red cell morphology, a transition to digital image technology from the conventional method for performing peripheral blood cell differentials is possible."

Of the different extracts from traditional Chinese medicines, Tubeimoside 1 (TBMS 1) is regarded as an effective treatment for cancer. To determine the mechanism of TBMS 1, the shape/pattern of HepG2 cells based on the microscopic imaging technology was determined to analyze experimental results; then the fluorescent spectra method was designed to investigate whether TBMS 1 affected HepG2 cells. A three-dimensional (3D) fluorescent spectra sweep was performed to determine the characteristic wave peak of HepG2 cells. A 2D fluorescent spectra method was then used to show the florescence change in HepG2 cells following treatment with TBMS 1. Finally, flow cytometry was employed to analyze the cell cycle of HepG2 cells. It was shown that TBMS 1 accelerated the death of HepG2 cells and had a strong dose- and time-dependent growth inhibitory effect on HepG2 cells, especially at the G2/M phase. These results indicate that the fluorescent spectra method is a promising substitute for flow cytometry as it is rapid and cost-effective in HepG2 cells."

Most of classic segmentation methods consider a homogeneous patch as an object, while the recorded cell images have rich details and a lot of small inhomogeneous patches, as well as some artifacts, which can impede the applications. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a hierarchical mergence approach (HMA) to extract homogeneous patches out and heuristically add them up. Initially, the maximum region of interest (ROI), in which only cell events exist, is drawn by using gradient information as a mask. Then, different levels of blurring based on kernel or grayscale morphological operations are applied to the whole image to produce reference images. Next, each of unconnected regions in the mask is applied with Otsu method independently according to different reference images. Consequently, the segmentation result is generated by the combination of usable patches in all informative layers. The proposed approach is more than simply a fusion of the basic segmentation methods, but a well-organized strategy that integrates these basic methods. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous methods within our datasets."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphometric features of placental villi and capillaries in preeclamptic and normal placentae. The study included light microscopic images of placental tissue sections of 40 preeclamptic and 35 normotensive pregnant women. Preprocessing and segmentation of these images were performed to characterize the villi and capillaries. Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to identify the most significant placental (morphometric) features from microscopic images. A total of 10 morphometric features were extracted, of which the villous parameters were significantly altered in PE. FLDA identified 5 highly significant morphometric features (>90% overall discrimination accuracy). Two large subclusters were clearly visible in HCA based dendrogram. PCA returned three most significant principal components cumulatively explaining 98.4% of the total variance based on these 5 significant features. Hence, quantitative microscopic evaluation revealed that placental morphometry plays an important role in characterizing PE, where the villous is the major component that is affected."

And the anatomy architecture reconstruction of neuron cell is one of the foremost challenges and important issues in neuroscience. Accurate reconstruction results can facilitate the subsequent neuron system simulation. With the development of confocal microscopy technology, researchers can scan neurons at submicron resolution for experiments. These make the reconstruction of complex dendritic trees become more feasible; however, it is still a tedious, time consuming, and labor intensity task. For decades, computer aided methods have been playing an important role in this task, but none of the prevalent algorithms can reconstruct full anatomy structure automatically. All of these make it essential for developing new method for reconstruction. This paper proposes a pipeline with a novel seeding method for reconstructing neuron structures from 3D microscopy images stacks. The pipeline is initialized with a set of seeds detected by sliding volume filter (SVF), and then the open curve snake is applied to the detected seeds for reconstructing the full structure of neuron cells. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline exhibits excellent performance in terms of accuracy compared with traditional method, which is clearly a benefit for 3D neuron detection and reconstruction."

Epub 2014 Aug 24.,Guerra G,Int J Surg,2014,2014/08/28,,,10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.08.391,"The neoplasms of the salivary glands account for 2% of head and neck tumors and the most common form is the Pleomorphic adenoma (PA). Parotid gland is affected from 80% to 90% of cases. In elderly these tumors occur mostly in females. These benign tumors are composed of epithelial and myoepithelial cells that are arranged with various morphological patterns and subtypes. The classification of these tumors is also based on the amount and nature of the stroma. In literature there is an almost complete consensus that, in the major salivary glands, PAs are enclosed by a layer of fibrous tissue often called ""capsule"" but there is disagreement about the form, extension and thickness of this layer. The treatment is surgical and there are two main different surgical approaches: an enucleation (local dissection) or so-called subtotal superficial parotidectomy and lateral or superficial total parotidectomy. Histopathological characteristics of PAs especially of capsular alterations such as thin capsule areas, capsule-free regions, capsule penetration, satellite nodules and pseudopodia in the different subtypes are important for the choice of surgical treatment and the first explanation for tumor recurrence. In our study we describe a morphological features of 84 cases of pleomorphic adenoma of parotid gland from elderly patients treated by a surgical ""enucleation like"" method called nucleoresection."

One of the images is made somewhat transparent, allowing detail in the underlying image to be visible and assisting in the registration of the two images. As an example, an image localizing a specific tissue component by fluorescence may be overlaid atop a TEM image of the same field. The resulting composite image would demonstrate specific ultrastructural features in the high-resolution TEM field, which are colorized in the overlay. Other examples include composites from MicroCT or soft X-ray images overlaid atop light microscopy or TEM images. Automated image registration may be facilitated by a variety of sophisticated computer programs utilized by high-throughput laboratories. This chapter is meant for the more occasional user wishing to align images manually. ImageJ is a public domain, image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health and is available to anyone as a free download. ImageJ performs marvelously well for the purpose of image registration; therefore, step-by-step instructions are included here. Specimen handling, including fixation and choice of embedding media, is not straightforward for correlative imaging. A step-by-step description of the protocols which work in our laboratory is included for simultaneous localization in LM, EM and micro-CT, as well as maintaining GFP emission in tissue embedded for TEM."

Before automatic analysis is possible, quality control procedures are applied to ensure that each image can be read consistently. One important quality control step is color normalization of the slide image, which adjusts for color variances (batch-effects) caused by differences in stain preparation and image acquisition equipment. Color batch-effects affect color-based features and reduce the performance of supervised color segmentation algorithms on images acquired separately. To identify an optimal normalization technique for histopathological color segmentation applications, five color normalization algorithms were compared in this study using 204 images from four image batches. Among the normalization methods, two global color normalization methods normalized colors from all stain simultaneously and three stain color normalization methods normalized colors from individual stains extracted using color deconvolution. Stain color normalization methods performed significantly better than global color normalization methods in 11 of 12 cross-batch experiments (p<;0.05). Specifically, the stain color normalization method using k-means clustering was found to be the best choice because of high stain segmentation accuracy and low computational complexity."

Based on the feature selection approach, it computes the most relevant subset of descriptors in terms of classification from a wide initial list of local and global descriptors. In comparison with equivalent methods, this implementation is able to find lists of descriptors which are significantly shorter for an equivalent accuracy and furthermore it enables the classification of slides using combinations of global and local measurements. The results have pointed that it could reach an accuracy of 82.8% in a human liver fibrosis grading approach by selecting 6 descriptors from an initial set of 258 global and local descriptors."

In the proposed method tissue sections are sliced at a low thickness level, around 1-1.5 mum, which provides a more detailed depiction of the nuclei and other textural information of cells usually not distinguishable in thicker specimens, such as 4-5 mum, that have been used in the past by other researchers. To identify CBs, a morphological and textural analysis is applied in order to extract various features related to their nuclei, nucleoli and cytoplasm. The generated feature vector is then used as input in a two-class SVM classifier with epsilon-Support Vector Regression and radial basis kernel function. Experimental results with an annotated dataset consisting of 300 images of centroblasts and non-centroblasts, derived from high-power field images of follicular lymphoma stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, have shown the great potential of the proposed method with an average detection rate of 97.44%."

Yet, manual segmentation and measurement of cells or other features in images remains the norm in many fields. We report on a new system that aims for robust and accurate semi-automated analysis of microscope images. A user interactively outlines one or more examples of a target object in a training image. We then learn a cost function for detecting more objects of the same type, either in the same or different images. The cost function is incorporated into an active contour model, which can efficiently determine optimal boundaries by dynamic programming. We validate our approach and compare it to some standard alternatives on three different types of microscopic images: light microscopy of blood cells, light microscopy of muscle tissue sections, and electron microscopy cross-sections of axons and their myelin sheaths."

A template matching method, with adaptive template intensity value, is then applied. Finally, a threshold is calculated based on the probability density function of the processed image after template matching. The threshold is then used to obtain the final segmentation result. Experimental results show that the proposed technique overcomes the limitation of the existing technique and provides a superior performance with sensitivity at 97.99%, and precision at 96.00%."

To address this challenge, we develop a clinical decision support system for automated Fuhrman grading of renal carcinoma biopsy images. We extract 1316 color, shape, texture and topology features and develop one vs. all models for four Fuhrman grades. Our models are highly accurate with 90.4% accuracy in a four-class prediction. Predictivity analysis suggests good generalization of the model development methodology through robustness to dataset sampling in cross-validation. We provide a semantic interpretation for the imaging features used in these models by linking features to pathologists' grading criteria. Our study identifies novel imaging features that are semantically linked to Fuhrman grading criteria."

Effective clinical translation of histology-driven MSI in systems oncology requires precise colocalization of morphological and biochemical features as well as advanced methods for data treatment and interrogation. Currently proposed MSI workflows are subject to several limitations, including nonoptimized raw data preprocessing, imprecise image coregistration, and limited pattern recognition capabilities. Here we outline a comprehensive strategy for histology-driven MSI, using desorption electrospray ionization that covers (i) optimized data preprocessing for improved information recovery; (ii) precise image coregistration; and (iii) efficient extraction of tissue-specific molecular ion signatures for enhanced biochemical distinction of different tissue types. The proposed workflow has been used to investigate region-specific lipid signatures in colorectal cancer tissue. Unique lipid patterns were observed using this approach according to tissue type, and a tissue recognition system using multivariate molecular ion patterns allowed highly accurate (>98%) identification of pixels according to morphology (cancer, healthy mucosa, smooth muscle, and microvasculature). This strategy offers unique insights into tumor microenvironmental biochemistry and should facilitate compilation of a large-scale tissue morphology-specific MSI spectral database with which to pursue next-generation, fully automated histological approaches."

METHODS: Triphasic MDCT scans of 38 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for a small PDA were retrospectively reviewed. The TDCs were analyzed and compared with histologic examination of the PDA and pancreas upstream/downstream in all cases. Three enhancement patterns were identified: 1) enhancement peak during pancreatic parenchymal phase (PPP) followed by a rapid decline on portal venous phase (PVP) and delayed phase (DP) at 5 minutes (type 1 pattern: normal pancreas); 2) maximum enhancement in PVP that gradually decreases in DP (type 2 pattern: mild chronic pancreatitis or PDA with mild fibrous stroma); 3) progressive enhancement with maximum peak in DP (type 3 pattern: severe chronic pancreatitis or PDA with severe fibrous stroma). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Sensitivity was calculated for PDA detection and an attenuation difference with the surrounding tissue of at least 10 HU was considered. RESULTS: PDA showed type 2 pattern in 5/38 cases (13.2%) and type 3 pattern in 33/38 cases (86,8%). Pancreas upstream to the tumor had type 2 pattern in 20/38 cases (52,6%) and type 3 pattern in 18/38 cases (47,4%). Pancreas downstream to the tumor had type 1 pattern in 19/25 cases (76%) and type 2 pattern in 6/25 cases (24%). Attenuation difference between tumor and parenchyma upstream was higher of 10 UH on PPP in 31/38 patients (sensitivity = 81.6%), on PVP in 29/38 (sensitivity = 76.3%) and on DP in 17/38 (sensitivity = 44.7%). Attenuation difference between tumor and parenchyma downstream was higher of 10 UH on PPP in 25/25 patients (sensitivity = 100%), on PVP in 22/25 (sensitivity = 88%) and on DP in 20/25 (sensitivity = 80%). Small PDAs were isodense to the pancreas upstream to the tumor, and therefore unrecognizable, in 8 cases (8/38; 21%) at qualitative analysis and in 4 cases (4/38; 10,5%) at quantitative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative analysis increases the sensitivity for detection of small PDA at triphasic MDCT."

Epub 2013 Jul 19.,Bertin C,Skin Res Technol,2014,2013/07/20,,,10.1111/srt.12088,"BACKGROUND: Stretch marks or striae distensae (SD) are characterized by epidermal atrophy following repeated over-stretching of the skin tissue. The objective of this study was to investigate the skin texture and microstructure of SD lesions compared to those of normal adjacent skin in vivo using non-invasive methods. METHODS: A population of 26 women and 3 men with SD were examined after giving written informed consent. Following clinical grading, skin replicas were collected, confocal microscopy was performed on SD lesions and healthy neighboring skin. Skin surface texture parameters were calculated using 3D image analysis of the skin replicas and epidermal and dermal microstructure were evaluated by analysis of the confocal images. In a parallel study, histological analysis was performed on 6 skin biopsies taken from abdominal reduction surgeries in areas where skin exhibited SD. RESULTS: Analysis of the skin surface texture showed that the SD area was more anisotropic and with higher skin roughness than the adjacent skin in terms of directions of skin microglyphics. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that SD were characterized by shallower dermal papillae (P < 0.05) and that dermal papillae height inversely correlated to the intensity of collagen alignment on the SD sites (P < 0.05). The histology findings confirmed the in vivo confocal microscopy findings. CONCLUSIONS: The skin structure of SD is qualitatively and quantitatively different compared to healthy skin. Altered skin relief reflects structural modifications in the dermis. Flattening of the dermal-epidermal junction maybe functionally related to the observed collagen fiber alignment. Observations by non-invasive methods were in line with the histological findings and therefore relevant in studies assessing the efficacy of SD treatment options."

Although perfusion evaluation of adult tumors is well established, hemodynamic properties are not well characterized in children. Our goal was to apply arterial spin-labeling perfusion for various pathologic types of pediatric brain tumors and evaluate the role of arterial spin-labeling in the prediction of tumor grade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arterial spin-labeling perfusion of 54 children (mean age, 7.5 years; 33 boys and 21 girls) with treatment-naive brain tumors was retrospectively evaluated. The 3D pseudocontinuous spin-echo arterial spin-labeling technique was acquired at 3T MR imaging. Maximal relative tumor blood flow was obtained by use of the ROI method and was compared with tumor histologic features and grade. RESULTS: Tumors consisted of astrocytic (20), embryonal (11), ependymal (3), mixed neuronal-glial (8), choroid plexus (5), craniopharyngioma (4), and other pathologic types (3). The maximal relative tumor blood flow of high-grade tumors (grades III and IV) was significantly higher than that of low-grade tumors (grades I and II) (P < .001). There was a wider relative tumor blood flow range among high-grade tumors (2.14 +/- 1.78) compared with low-grade tumors (0.60 +/- 0.29) (P < .001). Across the cohort, relative tumor blood flow did not distinguish individual histology; however, among posterior fossa tumors, relative tumor blood flow was significantly higher for medulloblastoma compared with pilocytic astrocytoma (P = .014). CONCLUSIONS: Characteristic arterial spin-labeling perfusion patterns were seen among diverse pathologic types of brain tumors in children. Arterial spin-labeling perfusion can be used to distinguish high-grade and low-grade tumors."

Thus, we applied polyvinyl alcohol-tetraethylorthosilicate-alginate-calcium oxide (PTAC) biocomposite cryogel on critical-sized cranial bone defects in wistar rats for examining the comparative bone regeneration of cryogel-treated and nontreated defects over a period of 4 weeks. An in-depth analysis was performed from macroscopic level till the gene level. Bone regeneration in cryogel-treated defects was clearly evident from the results, whereas the nontreated group did not show any defect healing except at few peripheral areas. At the macroscopic level, micro-computed tomography analysis revealed new bone formation. This was further confirmed at the cellular level, wherein, new bone formation was demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Osteoblastic differentiation was further validated by immunohistological staining of runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx-2) protein and via calcium-phosphate crystal formation after 2 weeks through scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Finally, at the gene level, real-time PCR analysis confirmed the mRNA expression of osteoblastic markers, that is, runx-2, collagen type I (Col I), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN). Therefore, the results of in vivo cranial defect model studies suggest that PTAC biocomposite cryogels can show suitable potential for human bone regeneration."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)-compliant, retrospective study, 25 patients [13 men, 12 women; mean age 56 years (34-74 years)] with histopathologically confirmed duodenal GISTs seen at Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital from December 1999 to October 2009 were identified. The MDCT of primary tumours in six patients and follow-up imaging in all the 25 patients was reviewed by two radiologists in consensus. Electronic medical records were reviewed to document the clinical characteristics and management. RESULTS: The mean size of the primary tumour was 3.7 cm (range 2.5-5.6 cm). Three of six primary tumours were in the second and third portions of the duodenum, one in the third portion, one in the third and fourth portions, and one in the fourth portion. Three of six of the tumours were exophytic, two were both exophytic and intraluminal, and one was intramural. The tumours were well-circumscribed, round or oval masses, with few lobulations, and were either homogeneously hyper-enhancing or heterogeneously isodense at MDCT. None of the tumours had necrosis, haemorrhage, calcification, or loco regional lymphadenopathy on imaging. Sixteen of 25 (64%) patients developed metastatic disease, the most common sites being liver (14/16; 87.5%) and peritoneum (5/16; 31%). CONCLUSION: Duodenal GISTs are well-circumscribed, round or oval masses, and occur in the second through fourth portions of the duodenum, without lymphadenopathy or duodenal obstruction. Duodenal GISTS metastasize frequently to the liver and peritoneum."

The purpose of this study was to develop a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that can acquire quantitative elastographic information from color SSI elastography images automatically and objectively for the purpose of classifying benign and malignant breast tumors. Conventional ultrasonography (US) and SSI elastography images of 125 breast tumors (81 benign, 44 malignant), in 93 consecutive patients (mean age: 40 y, age range: 16-75 y), were obtained. After reconstruction of tissue elasticity data and automatic segmentation of each breast tumor, 10 quantitative elastographic features of the tumor and peri-tumoral areas, respectively (elasticity modulus mean, maximum and standard deviation, hardness degree and elasticity ratio), were computed and evaluated. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for optimum classification via combination of these features. The B-mode Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) was used to compare gray-scale US and SSI elastography with respect to diagnostic performance. Histopathologic examination was used as the reference standard. Student's t-test, the Mann-Whitney U-test, the point biserial correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were performed for statistical analysis. As a result, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of benign/malignant classification were 95.2% (119/125), 90.9% (40/44), 97.5% (79/81), 95.2% (40/42) and 95.2% (79/83) for the CAD scheme, respectively, and 79.2% (99/125), 90.9% (40/44), 72.8% (59/81), 64.5% (40/62) and 93.7% (59/63) for BI-RADS assessment, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az value) for the proposed CAD system using the combination of elastographic features was significantly higher than the Az value for visual assessment by the radiologists using BI-RADS (0.97 vs. 0.91). The results indicate that SSI elastography could be used for computer-aided feature extraction, and the proposed CAD method could improve the diagnostic accuracy of classification of breast tumors to avoid unnecessary biopsy. Furthermore, elastographic features of the peri-tumoral area have the potential to provide critical information in differential diagnosis."

METHODS: 32 human enamel samples with artificial WSLs were assigned to 4 experimental groups (n=8); (a) BAG slurry, (b) PAA-BAG slurry, (c) ""standardised"" remineralisation solution (positive control) and (d) de-ionised water (negative control). Mechanical properties of enamel were assessed using surface and cross-section Knoop microhardness. Micro-Raman spectroscopy in StreamLine scan mode was used to scan lesion cross-sections. The intensity of the Raman phosphate peak at 959 cm(-1) was fitted and measured producing depth profiles analysed using a double-step fitting function. A further 20 samples (n=5) were used to obtain 3D images of surfaces using non-contact white light profilometry permitting measurement of lesion step height in relation to the sound enamel reference level, and to scan the lesion surface using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data were analysed statistically using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post-hoc tests. RESULTS: BAG, PAA-BAG and the remineralisation solution exhibited statistically significantly higher surface and cross-section Knoop microhardness compared to the negative control. Micro-Raman spectroscopy detected significantly higher phosphate content within the treated groups compared to the negative control group. Lesions' depth was not significantly reduced. SEM images revealed mineral depositions, with different sizes and shapes, within BAG, PAA-BAG and the positive control groups.

Epub 2013 Dec 3.,Reis H,Virchows Arch,2014,2013/12/04,,,10.1007/s00428-013-1512-3,"Steatosis in donor livers is an accepted adverse prognostic factor after liver transplantation. While its semiquantitative assessment shows varying reproducibility, it is questioned as a standard method. Additionally, the influence of hepatic steatosis on ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R injury) has not been evaluated in biopsies after reperfusion. We compared different staining and analyzing methods for the assessment of donor liver steatosis in order to predict I/R injury and clinical outcome after transplantation. To do this, 56 paired pre- and post-reperfusion liver biopsies were analyzed for macro- (MaS)/micro- (MiS) and total steatosis in cryo and permanent sections by special fat (Oil Red O or ORO) and standard stains. Computerized morphometrical analyses were compared to the semiquantitative assessment by a pathologist. I/R injury was determined histopathologically and by M30 immunohistochemistry. We found ORO to be more sensitive in detecting hepatic steatosis with higher reproducibility for MaS. Semiquantitative analyses were highly reproducible and not inferior to computerized morphometry. Categorized MaS as determined by ORO correlated with the extent of I/R injury, initial poor function, liver enzymes, and survival. Therefore fat stains like ORO are a reliable and easy method comprising significant advantages in the evaluation of hepatic steatosis and are thereby of prognostic value. Computerized analysis is a precise tool though not superior to semiquantitative analyses."

METHODS: Seventy-one thyroid nodules smaller than 10 mm with pathologic diagnoses were included in this study. The conventional sonographic features and quantitative elasticity features (VTQ) were observed and compared between benign and malignant nodules. RESULTS: There were 39 benign and 32 malignant nodules according to histopathologic examination. When compared with benign nodules, malignant nodules were more frequently taller than wide, poorly defined, and markedly hypoechoic (P < .05). Color Doppler sonographic features were not significantly different between benign and malignant nodules. The VTQ value for malignant nodules (mean +/- SD 3.260 +/- 0.725 m/s) was significantly higher than that of benign ones (2.108 +/- 0.455 m/s; P < .001). The cutoff point for the differential diagnosis was 2.910 m/s, with sensitivity, specificity, a positive predictive value, a negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of 71.9%, 100%, 100%, 81.2%, and 87.3% respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that a taller-than-wide shape, a poorly defined boundary, marked hypoechogenicity, and a VTQ value greater than 2.910 m/s were independent risk factors for malignancy, with odds ratios of 69.366, 41.864, 5.945, and 64.991. The combination of VTQ with a taller-than-wide shape had the highest sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% and 97.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The shape, margin, echogenicity, and VTQ value are useful sonographic criteria for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules smaller than 10 mm. When VTQ was combined with B-mode sonographic features, the sensitivity was improved significantly."

To reduce breast cancer mortality, mammographic screening programmes have been implemented in many Western countries. However, these programmes remain controversial because of the associated radiation exposure and the need for improvement in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Phase-contrast imaging is a new X-ray-based technology that has been shown to provide enhanced soft-tissue contrast and improved visualization of cancerous structures. Furthermore, there is some indication that these improvements of image quality can be maintained at reduced radiation doses. Thus, X-ray phase-contrast mammography may significantly contribute to advancements in early breast cancer diagnosis. Feasibility studies of X-ray phase-contrast breast CT have provided images that allow resolution of the fine structure of tissue that can otherwise only be obtained by histology. This implies that X-ray phase-contrast imaging may also lead to the development of entirely new (micro-) radiological applications. This review provides a brief overview of the physical characteristics of this new technology and describes recent developments towards clinical implementation of X-ray phase-contrast imaging of the breast."

Epub 2013 Sep 20.,da Silveira PF,J Endod,2014,2014/01/28,,,10.1016/j.joen.2013.07.007,"INTRODUCTION: Studies to evaluate the diagnostic power of imaging examinations to detect root resorption have been based on simulations produced by burs. Standardized, round, and well-outlined access cavities do not reproduce the characteristics of physiological lesions and may facilitate diagnosis, masking the true accuracy of imaging techniques. A methodology to simulate internal root resorption by using acid demineralization was developed. METHODS: Eleven extracted single-rooted teeth were mesiodistally sectioned into homologous halves. Root canals were labeled to ensure restricted and controlled action of fluids. The protocol was composed of 24-hour cycles (5% nitric acid for 12 hours, rinsing with deionized water, and 8% sodium hypochlorite for 10 minutes). At the end of each cycle 1 tooth was removed from treatment, defining an exposure time that cumulated to the last tooth. Electron microscopy imaging was assessed to determine lesion area and depth. RESULTS: Minimum and maximum and areas and depths were 3.14 mm(2) and 10.34 mm(2) and 0.22 mm and 1.59 mm, respectively. Resorption simulated by the protocol proposed reproduced lesions of different sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The irregular shape and larger diameter:depth ratio suggest that these lesions are more similar to in vivo internal root resorption, compared with bur-induced lesions."

As lesions become more vulnerable, different cholesterol species accumulate in the plaque. Understanding unstable atherosclerosis as a pharmacological and interventional therapeutic target requires chemically specific imaging of disease foci. In this study, we aim to image atherosclerotic plaque lipids and other vessel wall constituents with spectroscopic intravascular photoacoustics (sIVPA). sIVPA imaging can identify lipids in human coronary atherosclerotic plaque by relying on contrast in the near-infrared absorption spectra of the arterial wall components. Using reference spectra acquired on pure compounds, we analyzed sIVPA data from human coronary plaques ex vivo, to image plaque composition in terms of cholesterol and cholesterol ester content. In addition, we visualized the deeper lying connective tissue layers of the adventitia, as well as the fatty acid containing adipose cells in the peri-adventitial tissue. We performed simultaneous coregistered IVUS imaging to obtain complementary morphological information. Results were corroborated by histopathology. sIVPA imaging can distinguish the most prevalent lipid components of human atherosclerotic plaques and also visualize the connective tissue layers of the adventitia and the fatty acid containing adipose cells in the peri-adventitial tissue."

A retrospective medical record search identified 103 children (mean age: 87 months) with posterior fossa tumors having a total of 126 preoperative MR scans with DWI. The minimum ADC (ADCmin) and normalized ADC (nADC) values [ratio of ADCmin values in tumor compared to normal tissue] were measured by a single observer blinded to diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the optimal threshold for which the nADC and ADCmin values would predict tumor histology. Inter-rater reliability for predicting tumor type was evaluated using values measured by two additional observers. At histology, ten tumor types were identified, with astrocytoma (n=50), medulloblastoma (n=33), and ependymoma (n=9) accounting for 89%. Mean ADCmin (0.54 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and nADC (0.70) were lowest for medulloblastoma. Mean ADCmin (1.28 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and nADC (1.64) were highest for astrocytoma. For the ROC analysis, the area under the curve when discriminating medulloblastoma from other tumors using nADC was 0.939 and 0.965 when using ADCmin. The optimal ADCmin threshold was 0.66 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, which yielded an 86% positive predictive value, 97% negative predictive value, and 93% accuracy. Inter-observer variability was very low, with near perfect agreement among all observers in predicting medulloblastoma. Our data indicate that both ADCmin and nADC could serve as the basis for a CAD program to distinguish medulloblastoma from other posterior fossa tumors with a high degree of accuracy."

Epub 2013 Jul 5.,Torres R,Arch Pathol Lab Med,2014,2013/07/09,,,10.5858/arpa.2013-0094-OA,"CONTEXT: Despite continuing advances in tissue processing automation, traditional embedding, cutting, and staining methods limit our ability for rapid, comprehensive visual examination. These limitations are particularly relevant to biopsies for which immediate therapeutic decisions are most necessary, faster feedback to the patient is desired, and preservation of tissue for ancillary studies is most important. The recent development of improved tissue clearing techniques has made it possible to consider use of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) tools in clinical settings, which could address difficulties of established methods. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the potential of MPM of cleared tissue for the evaluation of unembedded and uncut pathology samples. DESIGN: Human prostate, liver, breast, and kidney specimens were fixed and dehydrated by using traditional histologic techniques, with or without incorporation of nucleic acid fluorescent stains into dehydration steps. A benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate clearing protocol was substituted for xylene. Multiphoton microscopy was performed on a home-built system. RESULTS: Excellent morphologic detail was achievable with MPM at depths greater than 500 mum. Pseudocoloring produced images analogous to hematoxylin-eosin-stained images. Concurrent second-harmonic generation detection allowed mapping of collagen. Subsequent traditional section staining with hematoxylin-eosin did not reveal any detrimental morphologic effects. Sample immunostains on renal tissue showed preservation of normal reactivity. Complete reconstructions of 1-mm cubic samples elucidated 3-dimensional architectural organization. CONCLUSIONS: Multiphoton microscopy on cleared, unembedded, uncut biopsy specimens shows potential as a practical clinical tool with significant advantages over traditional histology while maintaining compatibility with gold standard techniques. Further investigation to address remaining implementation barriers is warranted."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five types of surface modified arch wires and a conventional NiTi arch wire, all from different manufacturers, were evaluated for their corrosion resistance from breakdown potential in an anodic polarization scan in Ringer's solution. Surface characteristics were determined from scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and energy dispersive analysis. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc Duncan's multiple range tests were used to evaluate statistical significance. RESULTS: Surface modified NiTi wires showed significant improvement in corrosion resistance and reduction in surface roughness values. Breakdown potentials increased in the order of group 6 (conventional; 204 mV) < group 1 (nitride; 333 mV) < group 5 (epoxy resin; 346mV) < group 3 (oxide; 523 mV) < group 2 (gold; 872 mV) < group 4 (Teflon; 1181 mV), but root mean square (RMS) roughness values, which indicated surface roughness, followed a different pattern: group 3 (oxide; 74.12 nm) < group 1 (nitride; 221.651 nm) < group 4 (Teflon; 278.523 nm) < group 2 (gold; 317.894 nm) < group 5 (epoxy resin; 344.236 nm) < group 6 (conventional; 578.555 nm). CONCLUSIONS: Surface modification of NiTi wires proved to be effective in improving its corrosion resistance and decreasing surface roughness. However, neither factor could maintain a direct, one-to-one relationship. It meant that the type and nature of coating material can effectively influence the anticorrosive features of NiTi wires, compared with its surface roughness values."

Given the fundamental role that the actin cytoskeleton plays in the progression of cancer, it is an ideal target for chemotherapy. Although it is possible to image the actin cytoskeleton in a high-throughput manner, there is currently no validated method to quantify changes in the cytoskeleton in the same capacity, which makes research into its organization and the development of anticytoskeletal drugs difficult. We have validated the use of a linear feature detection algorithm, allowing us to measure changes in actin filament organization. Its ability to quantify changes associated with cytoskeletal disruption will make it a valuable tool in the development of compounds that target the cytoskeleton in cancer. Our results show that this algorithm can quantify cytoskeletal changes in a cell-based system after addition of both well-established and novel anticytoskeletal agents using either fluorescence microscopy or a high-content imaging approach. This novel method gives us the potential to screen compounds in a high-throughput manner for cancer and other diseases in which the cytoskeleton plays a key role."

Automated processing of images acquired using phase contrast microscopy (PCM), an imaging modality widely used for the visual inspection of adherent cell cultures, could enable the non-invasive determination of these characteristics. We present an image-processing approach that accurately detects cellular objects in PCM images through a combination of local contrast thresholding and post hoc correction of halo artifacts. The method was thoroughly validated using a variety of cell lines, microscope models and imaging conditions, demonstrating consistently high segmentation performance in all cases and very short processing times (<1 s per 1,208 x 960 pixels image). Based on the high segmentation performance, it was possible to precisely determine culture confluency, cell density, and the morphology of cellular objects, demonstrating the wide applicability of our algorithm for typical microscopy image processing pipelines. Furthermore, PCM image segmentation was used to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of fluorescence microscopy data, enabling the determination of temporal and spatial expression patterns of a fluorescent reporter. We created a software toolbox (PHANTAST) that bundles all the algorithms and provides an easy to use graphical user interface.

METHODS: Document retrieval was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, etc., from 1950 to June 2013. Metadisc1.4 software was used to analyse the pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and positive and negative likelihood ratio. The heterogeneity was assessed using forest plots and the inconsistency index (I(2)). Before statistical comparison, the area under (AUC) the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve (SROC) of two different diagnostic methods was calculated respectively. RESULTS: A total of seven studies involving 2,014 patients and 2,666 breast lesions were included. Compared with the gold standard (histological results), the pooled sensitivity and specificity of DBT were 90.0% and 79.0%, and for DM they were 89.0% and 72.0%, respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio of DBT and DM was 3.50 and 2.83; the pooled negative likelihood ratio of DBT and DM was 15% and 18%; the pooled DOR for DBT and DM was 26.04 and 16.24, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Digital breast tomosynthesis has a higher sensitivity and specificity in breast diagnosis than digital mammography. KEY POINTS: * Digital breast tomosynthesis has high sensitivity and specificity in breast diagnosis.* DBT appears to have superior diagnostic accuracy relative to digital mammography. * DBT images were captured at a lower dose than 2D images. * DBT displays abnormal features of lesions more clearly than DM. * Digital breast tomosynthesis could become the first choice for assessing breast lesions."

CB cells are often confused by similar looking cells within the tissue, therefore a system to help their classification is necessary. Our methods extract the discriminatory features of cells by approximating the intrinsic dimensionality from the subspace spanned by CB and non-CB cells. In the first method, discriminatory features are approximated with the help of singular value decomposition (SVD), whereas in the second method they are extracted using Laplacian Eigenmaps. Five hundred high-power field images were extracted from 17 slides, which are then used to compose a database of 213 CB and 234 non-CB region of interest images. The recall, precision, and overall accuracy rates of the developed methods were measured and compared with existing classification methods. Moreover, the reproducibility of both classification methods was also examined. The average values of the overall accuracy were 99.22% +/- 0.75% and 99.07% +/- 1.53% for COB and CLEM, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that both proposed methods provide better classification accuracy of CB/non-CB in comparison with the state of the art methods."

METHODS: Between March 2008 and May 2012, there were 20 patients with branch duct intraductal mucinous neoplasms and 25 with serous cystadenomas in our institute, for whom preoperative conventional and contrast-enhanced sonographic results were available. The final diagnosis was obtained by histopathology. Various conventional and contrast-enhanced sonographic characteristics were retrospectively evaluated by 2 radiologists in consensus. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of conventional and contrast-enhanced sonography for discriminating between the two entities. RESULTS: Three conventional sonographic characteristics (microcysts, cysts with internal echoes, and main pancreatic duct dilatation) and 2 contrast-enhanced sonographic characteristics (communication between the lesion and main pancreatic duct and enhancement of mural nodules) significantly improved the ability to differentiate branch duct intraductal mucinous neoplasms from serous cystadenomas. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.691 with conventional sonography to 0.859 with combined contrast-enhanced and conventional ultrasonography (P = .043). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients, the addition of contrast-enhanced sonography to conventional sonography improved the ability to differentiate branch duct intraductal mucinous neoplasms from serous cystadenomas."

A total of 42 pigmented skin tumors, including pigmented basal cell carcinoma, melanocytic nevus, and seborrheic keratosis were evaluated by HGM ex vivo or in vivo. Based on the standard histopathologic characteristics, we established the corresponding HGM imaging criteria for each pigmented tumor. Diagnostic performance of HGM for differentiating nonmelanoma pigmented skin tumors was evaluated through the observers' direct general assessment (overall evaluation) or the presence of two imaging criteria with the highest sensitivity and specificity (major criteria evaluation). Our results show that, based on the direct general assessment, the sensitivity is 92% [95% confidence interval (CI): 67 to 97%] and the specificity is 96% (95% CI: 83 to 99%); by major criteria evaluation, 94% sensitivity (95% CI: 70 to 99%) and 100% specificity (95% CI: 87 to 100%) are achieved. Our study indicates that HGM serves as a promising histopathological examination tool for noninvasive differential diagnostics of nonmelanoma pigmented skin tumors."

Intraoperative laparoscopic volume holographic imaging has the potential to provide simultaneous visualization of surface and subsurface structures in ovarian tissues for improved assessment of developing ovarian cancer. In this ex vivo ovarian tissue study, we assembled a benchtop volume holographic imaging system (VHIS) to characterize the microarchitecture of 78 normal and 40 abnormal tissue specimens derived from ovarian, fallopian tube, uterine, and peritoneal tissues, collected from 26 patients aged 22 to 73 undergoing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or abdominal cytoreductive surgery. All tissues were successfully imaged with the VHIS in both reflectance- and fluorescence-modes revealing morphological features which can be used to distinguish between normal, benign abnormalities, and cancerous tissues. We present the development and successful application of VHIS for imaging human ovarian tissue. Comparison of VHIS images with corresponding histopathology allowed for qualitatively distinguishing microstructural features unique to the studied tissue type and disease state. These results motivate the development of a laparoscopic VHIS for evaluating the surface and subsurface morphological alterations in ovarian cancer pathogenesis."

The low resolution neuronal EM images contain noise and generally few features are available for segmentation, therefore application of the conventional approaches to identify the neuron structure from EM images is not successful. We therefore present a multi-scale fused structure boundary detection algorithm in this study. In the algorithm, we generate an EM image Gaussian pyramid first, then at each level of the pyramid, we utilize Laplacian of Gaussian function (LoG) to attain structure boundary, we finally assemble the detected boundaries by using fusion algorithm to attain a combined neuron structure image. Since the obtained neuron structures usually have gaps, we put forward a reinforcement learning-based boundary amendment method to connect the gaps in the detected boundaries. We use a SARSA (lambda)-based curve traveling and amendment approach derived from reinforcement learning to repair the incomplete curves. Using this algorithm, a moving point starts from one end of the incomplete curve and walks through the image where the decisions are supervised by the approximated curve model, with the aim of minimizing the connection cost until the gap is closed. Our approach provided stable and efficient structure segmentation. The test results using 30 EM images from ISBI 2012 indicated that both of our approaches, i.e., with or without boundary amendment, performed better than six conventional boundary detection approaches. In particular, after amendment, the Rand error and warping error, which are the most important performance measurements during structure segmentation, were reduced to very low values. The comparison with the benchmark method of ISBI 2012 and the recent developed methods also indicates that our method performs better for the accurate identification of substructures in EM images and therefore useful for the identification of imaging features related to brain diseases."

The purpose of this preliminary work was to evaluate the possible association between the fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive (men = 25; average age = 66.8 +/- 9 years) symptomatic patients studied by use of a multidetector row CT scanner were prospectively analyzed. CTA was performed before and after contrast and radiation doses were recorded; analysis of contrast plaque enhancement was performed. Patients underwent carotid endarterectomy en bloc; histologic sections were prepared and evaluated for fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to evaluate the differences between the 2 groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of fissured fibrous cap and microvessel attenuation on contrast plaque enhancement. Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were also calculated. RESULTS: Twelve patients had fissured fibrous cap. In 92% (11/12) of fissured fibrous cap-positive plaques, we found contrast plaque enhancement, whereas in 69% (24/35) of the plaques without fissured fibrous cap contrast plaque enhancement was found. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the contrast enhancement in plaques with fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 22.6) and without fissured fibrous cap (Hounsfield units = 12.9) (P = .011). On the regression analysis, both fissured fibrous cap and neovascularization were associated with contrast plaque enhancement (P = .0366 and P = .0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve confirmed an association between fissured fibrous cap and contrast plaque enhancement with an area under the curve of 0.749 (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with contrast plaque enhancement. Histologic analysis showed that the presence of fissured fibrous cap is associated with a larger contrast plaque enhancement compared with the contrast plaque enhancement of plaques without fissured fibrous cap."

Epub 2013 Nov 12.,Claridge E,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2014,2013/11/19,,,10.1109/TMI.2013.2290697,"A model-based inversion method was used to obtain quantitative estimates of histological parameters from multispectral images of the colon and to examine their potential for discriminating between normal and pathological tissues. Pixel-wise estimates of the mucosal blood volume fraction, density of the scattering particles and thickness were derived using a two-stage method. In the first (forward) stage reflectance spectra corresponding to given instances of the parameter values were computed using Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation through a multi-layered tissue. In the second (inversion) stage the parameter values were obtained via optimization using an iterated conditional modes algorithm based on Discrete Markov Random Fields. The method was validated on computer generated data contaminated with noise giving a mean normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) of 2.04. Validation on ex vivo images demonstrated that parametric maps show gross correspondence with histological features of mucosa characteristic of cancerous, precancerous and noncancerous colon lesions. The key signs of abnormality were shown to be the increase in the blood volume fraction and decrease in the density of scattering particles."

To demonstrate sequential motion characteristics of the entire TM by noncontact laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV), we have investigated multipoint TM measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A laser Doppler vibrometer was mounted on a surgical microscope. The velocity was measured at 33 points on the TM using noncontact LDV without any reflectors. Measurements were performed with tonal stimuli of 1, 3, and 6 kHz. Amplitudes were calculated from these measurements, and time-dependent changes in TM motion were described using a graphics application. RESULTS: TM motions were detected more clearly and stably at 1 and 3 kHz than at other frequencies. This is because the external auditory canal acted as a resonant tube near 3 kHz. TM motion displayed 1 peak at 1 kHz and 2 peaks at 3 kHz. Large amplitudes were detected in the posterosuperior quadrant (PSQ) at 1 kHz and in the PSQ and anteroinferior quadrant (AIQ) at 3 kHz. The entire TM showed synchronized movement centered on the PSQ at 1 kHz, with phase-shifting between PSQ and AIQ movement at 3 kHz. Amplitude was smaller at the umbo than at other parts. In contrast, amplitudes at high frequencies were too small and complicated to detect any obvious peaks. CONCLUSION: Sequential multipoint motion of the tympanic membrane showed that vibration characteristics of the TM differ according to the part and frequency."

Epub 2014 Jan 8.,Rathore S,Comput Biol Med,2014,2014/02/25,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.12.010,"In recent years, classification of colon biopsy images has become an active research area. Traditionally, colon cancer is diagnosed using microscopic analysis. However, the process is subjective and leads to considerable inter/intra observer variation. Therefore, reliable computer-aided colon cancer detection techniques are in high demand. In this paper, we propose a colon biopsy image classification system, called CBIC, which benefits from discriminatory capabilities of information rich hybrid feature spaces, and performance enhancement based on ensemble classification methodology. Normal and malignant colon biopsy images differ with each other in terms of the color distribution of different biological constituents. The colors of different constituents are sharp in normal images, whereas the colors diffuse with each other in malignant images. In order to exploit this variation, two feature types, namely color components based statistical moments (CCSM) and Haralick features have been proposed, which are color components based variants of their traditional counterparts. Moreover, in normal colon biopsy images, epithelial cells possess sharp and well-defined edges. Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) based features have been employed to exploit this information. Different combinations of hybrid features have been constructed from HOG, CCSM, and Haralick features. The minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection method has been employed to select meaningful features from individual and hybrid feature sets. Finally, an ensemble classifier based on majority voting has been proposed, which classifies colon biopsy images using the selected features. Linear, RBF, and sigmoid SVM have been employed as base classifiers. The proposed system has been tested on 174 colon biopsy images, and improved performance (=98.85%) has been observed compared to previously reported studies. Additionally, the use of mRMR method has been justified by comparing the performance of CBIC on original and reduced feature sets."

Currently, it is assumed that otoconia contain a central core surrounded by a shell. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the inner structure of human otoconia. METHODS: Human otoconia were investigated by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The diffraction behavior was analyzed using X-ray techniques (XRD). Focused ion beam (FIB) slices of otoconia were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results were correlated with observations on degenerate human otoconia and decalcification experiments using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Artificial otoconia (calcite-gelatine and calcite-gelatine/agarose composites) were investigated in the same way and compared with human otoconia. RESULTS: Human otoconia represent highly mosaic-controlled calcite-based nanocomposites. The inner structure is composed of 3 + 3 branches with an ordered arrangement of nanocomposite particles and parallel orientation of fibrils. The surrounding belly is less ordered and appears more porous. Degenerate otoconia show a successive dissolution of the belly region exposing to the inner structure (branches) in later stages of degeneration. Artificial otoconia reveal identical chemical, crystallographic and morphologic patterns. They are, however, larger in size. CONCLUSION: Human otoconia show an inner architecture consisting of a less dense belly region and 3 + 3 more dense branches meeting at a central point (center of symmetry). The differences in volume densities and the resulting solubility may play a role in BPPV. Artificial otoconia may serve as a model for further investigations."

METHODS: In Phase-I, caries-like lesions were created in a defined window on 85 teeth by 14-day demineralization in acidified gel. During demineralization, teeth were examined for caries every 6 hours for 24 hours, and thereafter daily by visual examination (VE), FIRE, Quantitative light-induced Fluorescence (QLF), and DIAGNOdent pen (DDp). Five teeth were withdrawn after each examination. A tooth slice was cut from each window and examined under polarizing-light microscopy (PLM) for lesion presence/absence and lesion depth quantification. In Phase-II, 56 teeth assembled on mouth models were examined twice by two dentists for caries using the four methods. Each scored area was examined with PLM. Using Dentist-1/Examination-1 data, the Areas under Receiver Operating Characteristics curves (A-ROC-c) defined by each diagnostic method were compared using Chi-squared tests. Using same data, the validity of each diagnostic method in detecting caries relative to PLM was calculated by Kappa statistics. RESULTS: Earliest lesion depth detected by FIRE, QLF, and VE was 9.09 +/- 0.03 microm. DDp detected from 14.00 microm. A-ROC-c were significantly (P< 0.001) greater with FIRE compared with QLF and DDp. Similar results were observed with subsequent examinations by both dentists. Sensitivity, specificity and validity of each method are: FIRE (0.98, 0.80, 0.79), QLF (0.66, 0.81, 0.46), DDp (0.35, 0.94, 0.23) and VE (0.78, 0.85, 0.63), respectively."

A total of 120 patients underwent transabdominal CEUS. The initial enhancement time and intensity compared with the uterine myometrium, contrast agent distribution patterns and dynamic changes of enhancement were assessed. The sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy (ACC) and Youden's index were calculated for contrast variables. The gold standard was the histological diagnosis. There were 48 malignant tumors and 72 benign tumors. The enhancement features of malignant masses were different from benign ones. Earlier or simultaneous enhancement with inhomogeneous enhancement yielded the highest capability in differential diagnosis, and Sen, Spe, PPV, NPV, ACC, Youden's index was 89.6%, 97.2%, 93.2%, 95.6%, 93.3%, and 0.88, respectively. The qualitative evaluation of CEUS is useful in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses where conventional US is indeterminate."

In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy is a non-invasive technique for real-time imaging of the skin with cellular-level resolution. No previous data has been reported about confocal microscopy of bullous pemphigoid. Aim of this preliminary study is the evaluation of the potential of in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy for real-time, microscopical confirmation of clinical bullous pemphigoid diagnosis. METHODS: A total of nine lesions from patients affected by pemphigoid underwent in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy before histological examination. RESULTS: In our preliminary study, confocal microscopy showed high grade of correspondence to histopathology. In particular, presence of sub-epidermal cleft and variable amount of oedema of the upper dermis associated with inflammatory cells infiltration were seen as prevalent confocal features in the bullous lesions considered. Differently, in urticarial lesions, no specific features could be appreciated at confocal analysis beside the presence of signs of spongiosis and perivascular inflammation. CONCLUSION: Confocal microscopy seems to be useful for in vivo, microscopical confirmation of the clinical suspect of bullous pemphigoid and for biopsy site selection in urticarial lesions to obtain a more significant specimen for histopathological examination."

This study was designed to investigate the correlation of histologic grade with stellate features extracted from the coronal plane of 3-D ultrasound images. A pre-processing method was proposed to facilitate the extraction of stellate features. Extracted features were statistically measured to derive a set of indices that quantitatively represent the stellate pattern. These indices then went through a selection procedure to build proper decision trees. The splitting rules of decision trees indicated that stellate tumors are associated with low grade. A set of indices from the low grade-associated rules has the potential to represent the stellate feature. Further investigation of the hypoechoic region of peripheral tissue is essential to establishment of a complete discriminating model for tumor grades."

This study was designed to discriminate tumor entities using normalized vascular intratumoral signal intensity values (nVITS) obtained from pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL), combined with intratumoral susceptibility signals (ITSS) from susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Thirty consecutive patients with glioblastoma (n=22) and PCNSL (n=8), histologically classified according to the WHO brain tumor classification, were included. MRIs were acquired on a 3T scanner, and included PASL and SWI sequences. nVITS was defined by the signal intensity ratio between the tumor and the contralateral normal brain tissue, as obtained by PASL images. ITSS was determined as intratumoral low signal intensity structures detected on SWI sequences and were divided into four different grades. Potential differences in the nVITS and ITSS between glioblastomas and PCNSLs were revealed using statistical testing. To determine sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy, as well as an optimum cut-off value for the differentiation of PCNSL and glioblastoma, a receiver operating characteristic analysis was used. We found that nVITS (p=0.011) and ITSS (p=0.001) values were significantly higher in glioblastoma than in PCNSL. The optimal cut-off value for nVITS was 1.41 and 1.5 for ITSS, with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of more than 95%. These findings indicate that nVITS values have a comparable diagnostic accuracy to ITSS values in differentiating glioblastoma and PCNSL, offering a completely non-invasive and fast assessment of tumoral vascularity in a clinical setting."

However, the performance of such systems is confounded by nonbiological experimental variations or ""batch effects"" that can commonly occur in histopathological data, especially when images are acquired using different imaging devices and patient samples. This is even more problematic in large-scale studies in which cross-laboratory sharing of large volumes of data is necessary. Batch effects can change quantitative morphological image features and decrease the prediction performance. Using four batches of renal tumor images, we compare one image-level and five feature-level batch effect removal methods. Principal component variation analysis shows that batch is a large source of variance in image features. Results show that feature-level normalization methods reduce batch-contributed variance to almost zero. Moreover, feature-level normalization, especially ComBatN, improves cross-batch and combined-batch prediction performance. Compared to no normalization, ComBatN improves performance in 83% and 90% of cross-batch and combined-batch prediction models, respectively."

High pixel density cameras available on modern mobile phones have made photography simple and convenient for consumer applications; however, the camera hardware and software that enables this simplicity can present a barrier to accurate quantification of image data. This issue is exacerbated by automated settings, proprietary image processing algorithms, rapid phone evolution, and the diversity of manufacturers. If mobile phone cameras are to live up to their potential to increase access to healthcare in low-resource settings, limitations of mobile phone-based imaging must be fully understood and addressed with procedures that minimize their effects on image quantification. Here we focus on microscopic optical imaging using a custom mobile phone microscope that is compatible with phones from multiple manufacturers. We demonstrate that quantitative microscopy with micron-scale spatial resolution can be carried out with multiple phones and that image linearity, distortion, and color can be corrected as needed. Using all versions of the iPhone and a selection of Android phones released between 2007 and 2012, we show that phones with greater than 5 MP are capable of nearly diffraction-limited resolution over a broad range of magnifications, including those relevant for single cell imaging. We find that automatic focus, exposure, and color gain standard on mobile phones can degrade image resolution and reduce accuracy of color capture if uncorrected, and we devise procedures to avoid these barriers to quantitative imaging. By accommodating the differences between mobile phone cameras and the scientific cameras, mobile phone microscopes can be reliably used to increase access to quantitative imaging for a variety of medical and scientific applications."

This result was obtained by applying a multimodal fusion approach that combines synchrotron radiation microscopy techniques with off-line atomic force microscopy. The method proposed permits us to find the element concentration in addition to the mass fraction and provides a deeper and more complete knowledge of cell composition. We performed measurements on LoVo human colon cancer cells sensitive (LoVo-S) and resistant (LoVo-R) to doxorubicin. The comparison of LoVo-S and LoVo-R revealed different patterns in the maps of Mg concentration with higher values within the nucleus in LoVo-R and in the perinuclear region in LoVo-S cells. This feature was not so evident for the other elements, suggesting that Mg compartmentalization could be a significant trait of the drug-resistant cells."

METHODS: With IRB approval for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, we queried our institution's pathology database to derive all histologically proven cases of clear cell RCC with preoperative multiphasic MDCT with as many as four phases (unenhanced, corticomedullary, nephrographic, and excretory) from January 2000 to July 2010. Of 170 clear cell RCCs with preoperative multiphasic MDCT, 105 clear cell RCCs, representing 98 unique patients, had karyotypes of the resected specimens. Lesions were evaluated for magnitude and pattern of enhancement, contour, neovascularity, calcifications, and size. RESULTS: The corticomedullary phase mean enhancement of clear cell RCCs with a loss of 8p was significantly greater than that of clear cell RCCs without a loss of 8p (169.5 vs. 127.2 HU, p = 0.004). A threshold of 165 HU predicted the loss of 8p in clear cell RCCs with an accuracy of 78% (69/88), a specificity of 81% (62/77), and a negative predictive value of 94% (62/66). There were no significant differences in the pattern of enhancement, contour, neovascularity, calcification, or size between clear cell RCCs with a loss of 8p and those without this abnormality. CONCLUSION: Enhancement on multiphasic MDCT can predict the loss of 8p in clear cell RCCs and can thus provide a non-invasive means of guiding further management, including surgery, ablation, watchful waiting, or medical management."

These systems generally initiate a segmentation stage where white blood cells are separated from the background and other nonsalient objects. As the success of such imaging systems mainly depends on the accuracy of this stage, studies attach great importance for developing accurate segmentation algorithms. Although previous studies give promising results for segmentation of sparsely distributed normal white blood cells, only a few of them focus on segmenting touching and overlapping cell clusters, which is usually the case when leukemic cells are present. In this article, we present a new algorithm for segmentation of both normal and leukemic cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow images. In this algorithm, we propose to model color and shape characteristics of white blood cells by defining two transformations and introduce an efficient use of these transformations in a marker-controlled watershed algorithm. Particularly, these domain specific characteristics are used to identify markers and define the marking function of the watershed algorithm as well as to eliminate false white blood cells in a postprocessing step. Working on 650 white blood cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow images, our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the segmentation performance compared with its counterparts, leading to high accuracies for both sparsely distributed normal white blood cells and dense leukemic cell clusters."

With the increasing popularity of digital slide scanners, decision support systems based on the analysis of digital pathology images are in high demand. However, computerized decision support systems are fraught with problems that stem from color variations in tissue appearance due to variation in tissue preparation, variation in stain reactivity from different manufacturers/batches, user or protocol variation, and the use of scanners from different manufacturers. In this paper, we present a novel approach to stain normalization in histopathology images. The method is based on nonlinear mapping of a source image to a target image using a representation derived from color deconvolution. Color deconvolution is a method to obtain stain concentration values when the stain matrix, describing how the color is affected by the stain concentration, is given. Rather than relying on standard stain matrices, which may be inappropriate for a given image, we propose the use of a color-based classifier that incorporates a novel stain color descriptor to calculate image-specific stain matrix. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed stain matrix estimation and stain normalization methods, they are applied to the problem of tumor segmentation in breast histopathology images. The experimental results suggest that the paradigm of color normalization, as a preprocessing step, can significantly help histological image analysis algorithms to demonstrate stable performance which is insensitive to imaging conditions in general and scanner variations in particular."

METHODS: The sonographic features of 889 subcentimeter nodules were reviewed retrospectively with reference of histologic results. The diagnostic performance of each feature was evaluated. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to develop the formula for evaluation of subcentimeter nodules, and the cutoff value was decided for recommending biopsy. RESULTS: The logistic regression formula was -0.029age - 2.063US1 - 0.812US2 + 1.781US3 + 1.627height-to-width ratio - 0.333 (for nonhypoechogenicity, US1 = 1; for hypoechogenicity, US1 = 0; for a well-circumscribed margin, US2 = 1 and US3 = 0; for a microlobulated margin, US2 = 0 and US3 = 1; and for an irregular margin, US2 = 0 and US3 = 0). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the formula was 0.860. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the formula under the cutoff value of 0.284 were 90.9%, 54.0%, 66.4%, 85.6%, and 72.5%, respectively. With the use of the formula, 229 of 830 nodules could avoid surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A logistic regression formula with a cutoff value could provide an objective and easy tool with effective diagnostic performance, which could improve diagnosis of subcentimeter thyroid nodules and reduce unnecessary biopsy, decreasing costs and patient discomfort."

METHODS: FCFM imaging technique is a new medical imaging technique for which interest has yet to be established for diagnosis. This paper addresses the problem of lung cancer detection using FCFM images and, as a first contribution, assesses the feasibility of computer-aided diagnosis through these images. Towards this aim, we have built a pattern recognition scheme which involves a feature extraction stage and a classification stage. The second contribution relies on the features used for discrimination. Indeed, we have employed the so-called scattering transform for extracting discriminative features, which are robust to small deformations in the images. We have also compared and combined these features with classical yet powerful features like local binary patterns (LBP) and their variants denoted as local quinary patterns (LQP). RESULTS: We show that scattering features yielded to better recognition performances than classical features like LBP and their LQP variants for the FCFM image classification problems. Another finding is that LBP-based and scattering-based features provide complementary discriminative information and, in some situations, we empirically establish that performance can be improved when jointly using LBP, LQP and scattering features. CONCLUSIONS: In this work we analyze the joint capability of FCFM images and scattering features for lung cancer diagnosis. The proposed method achieves a good recognition rate for such a diagnosis problem. It also performs well when used in conjunction with other features for other classical medical imaging classification problems."

We demonstrate image analysis methodology to quantify the histopathological features which could permit standardisation across institutes and aid risk stratification of Dukes B patients. METHODS: Multiplexed immunofluorescence of pan-cytokeratin, D2-40 and DAPI identified epithelium, lymphatic vessels and all nuclei respectively in tissue sections from 50 patients diagnosed with Dukes A (n = 13), Dukes B (n = 29) and Dukes C (n = 8) CRC. An image analysis algorithm was developed and performed, on digitised images of the CRC tissue sections, to quantify TB, LVD, and LVI at the invasive front. RESULTS: TB (HR =5.7; 95% CI, 2.38-13.8), LVD (HR =5.1; 95% CI, 2.04-12.99) and LVI (HR =9.9; 95% CI, 3.57-27.98) were successfully quantified through image analysis and all were shown to be significantly associated with poor survival, in univariate analyses. LVI (HR =6.08; 95% CI, 1.17-31.41) is an independent prognostic factor within the study and was correlated to both TB (Pearson r =0.71, p <0.0003) and LVD (Pearson r =0.69, p <0.0003). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate methodology through image analysis which can standardise the quantification of TB, LVD and LVI from a single tissue section while decreasing observer variability. We suggest this technology is capable of stratifying a high risk Dukes B CRC subpopulation and we show the three histopathological features to be of prognostic significance."

STUDY DESIGN: The applied methods use combined gradient and mathematical morphology to obtain nuclei and classifiers in the form of support vector machine to estimate their Fuhrman grade. The starting point is a microscopic kidney image, which is subject to the advanced methods of preprocessing, leading finally to estimation of Fuhrman grade of cells and the whole analyzed image. RESULTS: The results of the numerical experiments have shown that the proposed nuclei descriptors based on different principles of generation are well connected with the Fuhrman grade. These descriptors have been used as the diagnostic features forming the inputs to the classifier, which performs the final recognition of the cells. The average discrepancy rate between the score of our system and the human expert results, estimated on the basis of over 3,000 nuclei, is below 10%. CONCLUSION: The obtained results have shown that the system is able to recognize 4 Fuhrman grades of the cells with high statistical accuracy and agreement with different expert scores. This result gives a good perspective to apply the system for supporting and accelerating the research of kidney cancer."

However, it is currently difficult to measure corneal mechanical changes noninvasively. The objective of this study is to evaluate if Brillouin optical microscopy can differentiate the mechanical properties of keratoconic corneas versus healthy corneas ex vivo. METHODS: We obtained eight tissue samples from healthy donor corneas used in Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) and 10 advanced keratoconic corneas from patients undergoing deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). Within 2 hours after surgery, a confocal Brillouin microscope using a monochromatic laser at 532 nm was used to map the Brillouin frequency shifts of the corneas. RESULTS: The mean Brillouin shift in the anterior 200 mum of the keratoconic corneas at the cone was measured to be 7.99 +/- 0.10 GHz, significantly lower than 8.17 +/- 0.06 GHz of the healthy corneas (P < 0.001). The Brillouin shift in the keratoconic corneas decreased with depth from the anterior toward posterior regions with a steeper slope than in the healthy corneas (P < 0.001). Within keratoconic corneas, the Brillouin shift in regions away from the apex of the cone was significantly higher than within the cone region (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Brillouin measurements revealed notable differences between healthy and keratoconic corneas. Importantly, Brillouin imaging showed that the mechanical loss is primarily concentrated within the area of the keratoconic cone. Outside the cone, the Brillouin shift was comparable with that of healthy corneas. The results demonstrate the potential of Brillouin microscopy for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of keratoconus."

METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 23 patients without histologically proven prostate carcinoma (PCa) and 27 patients with histologically proven PCa. Two methods were used to determine IVIM parameters (f, D, D*). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed for IVIM parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient for discrimination of prostate tissue. RESULTS: The IVIM parameters showed no significant difference between patients without PCa and normal areas in patients with PCa (r = 0.46-0.99). Results for D were not significantly different for both methods (P = 0.22), whereas f from method 1 was significantly higher than the f from method 2 (P < 0.05). The diffusion parameters D (both methods) and apparent diffusion coefficient could discriminate between tumor and normal areas (receiver operating characteristic analysis, area under the curve, >/=0.90). Additionally, in subgroup analysis, only D was able to discriminate between low- and high-grade PCa. CONCLUSIONS: For tumor detection, IVIM diffusion does not yield a clear added value, but the perfusion-free diffusion constant D may hold potential for improved image-based tumor grading."

As ADC estimates can be affected by the weighting factors, our goal was to determine the optimal pair of b-values for discriminating breast lesions at 3.0 T. METHODS: 152 females with 157 lesions (89 malignant and 68 benign) underwent breast MRI, including a DWI sequence sampling six b-values 50, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 s mm(-2). ADC values were computed from different pairs of b-values and compared with ADC obtained by fitting the six b-values using a mono-exponential diffusion model (ADCall). Cut-off ADC values were determined and diagnostic performance evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis using Youden statistics. Mean ADCs were determined for normal tissue and lesions. Differences were evaluated by lesion and histological types. RESULTS: Considering the cut-off values 1.46 and 1.49 x 10(3)mm(2) s(-1), the pairs 50, 1000 and 200, 800 s mm(-2) showed the highest accuracy, 77.5% and 75.4% with areas under the curve 84.4% and 84.2%, respectively. The best pair for ADC quantification was 50, 1000 s mm(-2) with 38/49 true-negative and 69/89 true-positive cases respectively; mean ADCs were 1.86 +/- 0.46, 1.77 +/- 0.37 and 1.15 +/- 0.46 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) for normal, benign and malignant lesions. There were no significant differences in these ADC values when compared with ADCall (ADC calculated from the full set of b - values) [difference = 0.0075 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1); confidence interval 95%: (-0.0036; 0.0186); p = 0.18]. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance in differentiating malignant and benign lesions was most accurate for the b-value pair 50, 1000 s mm(-2). ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The best b-value pair for lesion discrimination and characterization through ADC quantification was 50, 1000 s mm(-2)."

Protein translocation is constrained due to the cellular organization into subcompartments that impose diffusion barriers and guide enzymatic activities to their targets. Here, we introduce an approach to retrieve structural features from the scale-dependent mobility of green fluorescent protein monomer and multimers in human cells. We measure protein transport simultaneously between hundreds of positions by multi-scale fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy using a line-illuminating confocal microscope. From these data we derive a quantitative model of the intracellular architecture that resembles a random obstacle network for diffusing proteins. This topology partitions the cellular content and increases the dwell time of proteins in their local environment. The accessibility of obstacle surfaces depends on protein size. Our method links multi-scale mobility measurements with a quantitative description of intracellular structure that can be applied to evaluate how drug-induced perturbations affect protein transport and interactions."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Diagnostic work-up of 1320 patients who underwent surgical exploration due to an adnexal mass at a tertiary referral center were included. We assessed the discriminative value of pattern recognition, a sonographic morphological scoring system, RMI and CA 125 by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Cohen's kappa for each diagnostic approach while using histopathology as the reference standard. RESULTS: Pattern recognition showed the highest discriminative power with an observed kappa of 0.53. Sensitivity and specificity yielded 0.76 and 0.97 respectively. Combining pattern recognition with CA 125 serum measurement in the context of a triage system diminished the diagnostic value (kappa: 0.24; sensitivity: 0.29 specificity: 0.97). For the RMI we observed a sensitivity of 0.54 and a specificity of 0.96 and estimated kappa value yielded 0.37. Omitting the CA 125 assay and using a morphological sonographic assessment system increased the kappa value to 0.45 with sensitivity and specificity observed at 0.61 and 0.97 respectively. CONCLUSION: Expert pattern recognition was found to be the method with the highest discriminative power in assessing an adnexal mass during premenopause. Additional assessment of serum CA 125 diminished the diagnostic accuracy. Standardized morphological sonographic assessment resulted in a moderate diagnostic accuracy. Supplementing the morphological sonographic assessment with CA 125 by using the RMI algorithm did not improve the diagnostic value."

Epub 2013 Dec 8.,Stecco C,Surg Radiol Anat,2014,2013/12/10,,,10.1007/s00276-013-1244-8,"The aim of this paper was to examine the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the paratendineous tissues (paratenon, epitenon and endotenon) of the calcaneal tendon to better understand their role in the pathogenesis of ""tendinopathy"". Ten non-embalmed legs from cadavers were used. Histological and immunohistochemical studies were done at the middle third of the tendon. Magnetic resonance images of the hind foot were made in 60 living subjects to analyze the morphological alterations of tendon and paratenon. The paratenon is a thick fibrous layer with few elastic fibers, continuous with the crural fascia, well vascularized and innervated. It forms a sheath around the tendon similar to a synovial layer, but less organized. Indeed, it has no complete epithelium, but only some cells producing hyaluronan, called fasciacytes. Crural fascia and paratenon can be clearly observed by MRI, appearing as homogeneous, low signal intensity bands, sharply defined in the context of subcutaneous tissue in T1-weighted sequences. The mean thickness of the crural fascia was 1.11 mm in healthy subjects and 1.30 mm in patients (p < 0.005). The mean value of paratenon thickness in patients was 1.34 mm, 0.85 in healthy (p < 0.0001). The paratenon is more highly vascularized and innervated than the tendon, supporting the hypothesis that it is the origin of pain in tendinopathy. The imaging study suggests that, an increase in the thickness of the paratenon more than 1.35 mm is predictive of paratendinopathy, even before tendon damage."

Epub 2013 Nov 25.,Marionneaux S,Int J Lab Hematol,2014,2014/01/10,,,10.1111/ijlh.12167,"INTRODUCTION: Atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (aCLL) is a morphologic variant found in approximately 25% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although aCLL has a more aggressive course compared to typical CLL (tCLL), it is not usually reported. This retrospective study used digital microscopy to morphologically classify CLL patients as aCLL or tCLL, and determined the prevalence of prognostic markers in each group. METHODS: CellaVision AB (Lund, Sweden) was used to evaluate lymphocyte morphology on archived blood films of 97 CLL patients, and results of their prognostic marker analysis at diagnosis were obtained. The unpaired t-test, Chi-square, or Fisher's Exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 27% of CLL cases were morphologically classified as aCLL. The aCLL group had a higher prevalence of trisomy 12, unmutated IgVH, and CD38 expression (markers associated with poor prognosis), and a lower prevalence of 13q14 deletions compared to tCLL; this was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Using digital imaging to identify aCLL is feasible, economical, and may provide clinically relevant prognostic information at diagnosis and during periodic monitoring. Further study of a larger number of patients is needed to assess the clinical utility of reporting aCLL morphology."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of 56 patients (both DWI and STIR-DWI performed) were retrospectively analysed. Parameters compared between DWI and STIR-DWI were image artefacts, image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Diagnostic utility was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: No abnormality was detected in 17 patients, with lesions observed in 39 patients (16 benign, 23 malignant; confirmed by biopsy or surgical histopathology). The rate of image artefacts was significantly lower for STIR-DWI (p < 0.01): quality levels 1 (best), 2, and 3 accounted for 50%, 35.7%, and 14.3% of DWI images, and 96.4%, 3.6% and 0% of STIR-DWI images, respectively. The SNR was not significantly different. ADC values of breast lesions and normal glands were significantly lower for DWI than for STIR-DWI (p = 0.03 and 0.034). ADC values of malignant lesions, but not benign lesions, were significantly lower for DWI than for STIR-DWI (p = 0.02). CNR values of both benign and malignant lesions were not significantly different between DWI and STIR-DWI. The area under the ROC curve, for the use of ADC values to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, was not significantly different between DWI (0.931) and STIR-DWI (0.914). Taking a threshold ADC value of 1.23 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, the sensitivity and specificity were 87.5% and 87% for DWI, and 87.5% and 82.6% for STIR-DWI, respectively. CONCLUSION: STIR-DWI is adequate for clinical use in breast MRI investigations."

However, this procedure does not provide surgeons or pathologists with microscopic views of the tissue, which makes it difficult to accurately assess margin status or the extent of the disease, especially in non-palpable cases. We use a combination of spectral and polarization macroscopic imaging to optically segment the adipose and collagen tissues thus highlighting regions suspected of containing epithelium in order to facilitate optical microscopy techniques. A small study on five lumpectomy and mastectomy samples showed a sensitivity of 70% +/- 20% and specificity of 50% +/- 10% for adipose segmentation and a sensitivity of 50% +/- 20% and specificity of 50% +/- 20% for collagen segmentation. This sensitivity and specificity are sufficient for providing morphological information to the pathologist in order to guide microscopic examination of regions likely to be of clinical significance."

This paper presents an image processing based method for automated offline analyses of SEM images. To this end, our strategy relies on a two-stage process, viz. texture analysis and quantification. The method involves a preprocessing step, aimed at the noise removal, in order to avoid false edges. For texture analysis, the proposed method employs a state of the art Curvelet transform followed by segmentation through a combination of entropy filtering, thresholding and mathematical morphology (MM). The quantification is carried out by the application of a box-counting algorithm, for fractal dimension (FD) calculations, with the ultimate goal of measuring the parameters, like surface area and perimeter. The perimeter is estimated indirectly by counting the boundary boxes of the filled shapes. The proposed method, when applied to a representative set of SEM images, not only showed better results in image segmentation but also exhibited a good accuracy in the calculation of surface area and perimeter. The proposed method outperforms the well-known Watershed segmentation algorithm."

The SPIM excitation module shapes and deflects the light such that the sample is illuminated by a light sheet perpendicular to the detection path of the microscope. The system is characterized by use of a rectangular capillary for holding (and in an advanced version also by a micro-capillary approach for rotating) the samples, by synchronous adjustment of the illuminating light sheet and the objective lens used for fluorescence detection as well as by adaptation of a microfluidic system for application of fluorescent dyes, pharmaceutical agents or drugs in small quantities. A protocol for working with this system is given, and some technical details are reported. Representative results include (1) measurements of the uptake of a cytostatic drug (doxorubicin) and its partial conversion to a degradation product, (2) redox measurements by use of a genetically encoded glutathione sensor upon addition of an oxidizing agent, and (3) initiation and labeling of cell necrosis upon inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Differences and advantages of the present SPIM module in comparison with existing systems are discussed."

However, it has been established that the field of view of a single CCM image ( approximately 0.16 mm(2)) is insufficient for reliable assessment of corneal nerve fiber morphology. The present work proposes a highly automated technique for imaging an extended area of the SNP and creating large-scale montages. METHODS: A moving fixation target is presented on a small display in front of the nonexamined eye. By guiding the viewing direction of the subject in an expanding spiral pattern, the scanned corneal area is continuously expanded. Specialized software algorithms subsequently assemble a mosaic image from the acquired CCM image data. The proposed technique was applied in 12 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Montage images of the SNP were successfully created from all examinations performed. The mean imaged SNP area was 9.86 mm(2) (range, 1.62-18.31 mm(2)). The mean CCM duration was 65.33 seconds (range, 14.58-142.58 seconds). CONCLUSIONS: The key advances embodied in the proposed technique are its high degree of integration and automation (both for image acquisition and image processing) and the resulting short duration of CCM. By providing an easy-to-use tool for obtaining large-scale mosaic images of the SNP, this technique has the potential to facilitate larger clinical trials where SNP morphology is used as a surrogate marker for peripheral neuropathy."

Epub 2014 Mar 3.,Jung S,Biometrics,2014,2014/03/05,,,10.1111/biom.12164,"Set classification problems arise when classification tasks are based on sets of observations as opposed to individual observations. In set classification, a classification rule is trained with N sets of observations, where each set is labeled with class information, and the prediction of a class label is performed also with a set of observations. Data sets for set classification appear, for example, in diagnostics of disease based on multiple cell nucleus images from a single tissue. Relevant statistical models for set classification are introduced, which motivate a set classification framework based on context-free feature extraction. By understanding a set of observations as an empirical distribution, we employ a data-driven method to choose those features which contain information on location and major variation. In particular, the method of principal component analysis is used to extract the features of major variation. Multidimensional scaling is used to represent features as vector-valued points on which conventional classifiers can be applied. The proposed set classification approaches achieve better classification results than competing methods in a number of simulated data examples. The benefits of our method are demonstrated in an analysis of histopathology images of cell nuclei related to liver cancer."

METHODS: Thirty single-rooted premolars with oval-shaped canals were shaped and cleaned, and obturated with one of the three obturation techniques (N=10): GuttaCore, warm vertical compaction or cold lateral compaction. Filled canals were scanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT); reconstructed images were analysed for the volumetric percentage of gaps and voids at three canal levels (0-4mm, 4-8mm and 8-12mm from working length). The roots were subsequently sectioned at the 4-mm, 8-mm and 12-mm levels for analyses of the percentage of interfacial gaps, and area percentage of interfacial and intracanal voids, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to examine negative replicas of root sections. Data were analysed with parametric or non-parametric statistical methods at alpha=0.05. RESULTS: Both micro-CT and SEM data indicated that canals obturated with GuttaCore core-carriers had the lowest incidence of interfacial gaps and voids, although the results were not significantly different from canals obturated by warm vertical compaction. Both the GuttaCore and the warm vertical compaction groups, in turn, had significantly lower incidences of gaps and voids than the cold lateral compaction group. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the similarity in obturation quality between GuttaCore and warm vertical compaction, practitioners may find the GuttaCore core-carrier technique a valuable alternative for obturation of oval-shaped canals. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The quality of obturation achieved by GuttaCore in single-rooted canals is not significantly different from that achieved by warm vertical compaction."

Epub 2014 May 12.,Nosrati MS,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2014,2014/05/20,,,10.1109/TMI.2014.2323074,"Incorporating prior knowledge into image segmentation algorithms has proven useful for obtaining more accurate and plausible results. Two important constraints, containment and exclusion of regions, have gained attention in recent years mainly due to their descriptive power. In this paper, we augment the level set framework with the ability to handle these two intuitive geometric relationships, containment and exclusion, along with a distance constraint between boundaries of multi-region objects. Level set's important property of automatically handling topological changes of evolving contours/surfaces enables us to segment spatially-recurring objects (e.g., multiple instances of multi-region cells in a large microscopy image) while satisfying the two aforementioned constraints. In addition, the level set approach gives us a very simple and natural way to compute the distance between contours/surfaces and impose constraints on it. The downside, however, is a local optimization framework in which the final segmentation solution depends on the initialization. In fact, here, we sacrifice the optimizability (local instead of global solution) in exchange for lower space complexity (less memory usage) and faster runtime (especially for large microscopic images) as well as no grid artifacts. Nevertheless, the result from validating our method on several biomedical applications showed the utility and advantages of this augmented level set framework (even with rough initialization that is distant from the desired boundaries). We also compared our framework with its counterpart methods in the discrete domain and reported the pros and cons of each of these methods in terms of metrication error and efficiency in memory usage and runtime."

METHODS: Forty patients who were diagnosed to have acute cholecystitis by ultrasonographic examination were included in this study. The control group consisted of 18 patients without symptoms of gallstones and cholecystitis whose gallbladder walls were thickened due to cirrhotic ascites. Both groups were examined using diffusion weighted imaging, and the mean ADC values were compared using Student's t-test. RESULTS: The diagnoses of the 40 patients were proven by histopathological examination. The mean ADC values of patients diagnosed with cholecystitis (1.68 +/- 0.36 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) were significantly lower than the mean ADC values of the control group (2.35 +/- 0.24 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (p < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis based on ADC revealed a cut-off value of 2.04 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for the diagnosis of cholecystitis, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 89.7%. CONCLUSION: ADC value quantification may be an efficient method for making a diagnosis of cholecystitis and in differential diagnosis of cholecystitis from the extrinsic benign gallbladder wall thickening that can be seen during the course of cirrhotic ascites."

METHODS: 51 cirrhotic patients with 63 histologically proven HCCs </=2 cm underwent abdominal MRI, including DWI (b-values 50, 400 and 800 s mm(-2)) and T2 weighted sequences. HCCs were classified into well-differentiated HCCs (n = 37) and moderately differentiated HCCs (n = 26). Relative contrast ratios (RCRs) between the lesions and the surrounding liver were performed and compared between the two groups for T2 weighted images, each b-value and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare RCRs in T2 and diffusion-weighted images. RESULTS: We found significant differences in RCRs between well-differentiated vs moderately differentiated HCCs for b = 50, 400 and 800 s mm(-2) and T2 weighted images (1.35 +/- 0.36 vs 1.86 +/- 0.62; 1.35 +/- 0.38 vs 1.82 +/- 0.60; 1.27 +/- 0.30 vs 1.74 +/- 0.53; 1.14 +/- 0.18 vs 1.43 +/- 0.28, respectively; p < 0.001), whereas no significant differences were observed in ADC and ADC RCR (1.05 +/- 0.19 vs 0.99 +/- 0.15 and 1.1 +/- 0.22 vs 1.09 +/- 0.23; p = 0.16 and p = 0.82, respectively). No significant difference was found in the areas under the ROC curve for RCRs of T2 weighted images and every DWI b-value (p = 0.18). CONCLUSION: The RCR measurement performed in DWI 50, 400 and 800 b-values and T2 demonstrated a significant difference between well-differentiated and moderately differentiated small-sized HCCs. Furthermore, no difference was shown by using either ADC or ADC RCR. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: DWI with RCR measurement may be a valuable tool for non-invasively predicting the histological grade of small HCCs."

Although setups based on augmented reality have been used for various neurosurgical pathologies, very few cases have been reported for the surgery of arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present our experience with AVM surgery using a system designed for image injection of virtual images into the operating microscope's eyepiece, and discuss why augmented reality may be less appealing in this form of surgery. METHODS: N = 5 patients underwent AVM resection assisted by augmented reality. Virtual three-dimensional models of patients' heads, skulls, AVM nidi, and feeder and drainage vessels were selectively segmented and injected into the microscope's eyepiece for intraoperative image guidance, and their usefulness was assessed in each case. RESULTS: Although the setup helped in performing tailored craniotomies, in guiding dissection and in localizing drainage veins, it did not provide the surgeon with useful information concerning feeder arteries, due to the complexity of AVM angioarchitecture. CONCLUSION: The difficulty in intraoperatively conveying useful information on feeder vessels may make augmented reality a less engaging tool in this form of surgery, and might explain its underrepresentation in the literature. Integrating an AVM's hemodynamic characteristics into the augmented rendering could make it more suited to AVM surgery."

In this paper, a new segmentation method based on high level features is proposed which can process the structure of vessel and non-vessel independently. In this method, segmentation is done in two steps. First, using low level features segmentation is accomplished. Second, using high level features, the non-vessel components are removed. For evaluation, STARE database is used which is publicly available in this field. The results show that the proposed method has 0.9536 accuracy and 0.0191 false positive average on all images of the database and 0.9542 accuracy and 0.0236 false positive average on pathological images. Therefore, the proposed approach shows acceptable accuracy on all images compared to other state of the art methods, and the least false positive average on pathological images."

Epub 2014 Jul 7.,Lee J,NMR Biomed,2014,2014/07/22,,,10.1002/nbm.3153,"The accurate diagnosis of glioma subtypes is critical for appropriate treatment, but conventional histopathologic diagnosis often exhibits significant intra-observer variability and sampling error. The aim of this study was to investigate whether histogram analysis using an automatically segmented region of interest (ROI), excluding cystic or necrotic portions, could improve the differentiation between low-grade and high-grade gliomas. Thirty-two patients (nine low-grade and 23 high-grade gliomas) were included in this retrospective investigation. The outer boundaries of the entire tumors were manually drawn in each section of the contrast-enhanced T1 -weighted MR images. We excluded cystic or necrotic portions from the entire tumor volume. The histogram analyses were performed within the ROI on normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. To evaluate the contribution of the proposed method to glioma grading, we compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We found that an ROI excluding cystic or necrotic portions was more useful for glioma grading than was an entire tumor ROI. In the case of the fifth percentile values of the normalized ADC histogram, the area under the ROC curve for the tumor ROIs excluding cystic or necrotic portions was significantly higher than that for the entire tumor ROIs (p < 0.005). The automatic segmentation of a cystic or necrotic area probably improves the ability to differentiate between high- and low-grade gliomas on an ADC map."

The present study compared the expression of IL-17 in periradicular cysts and granulomas and evaluated the association of this cytokine with clinical and radiographic findings. METHODS: Apical periodontitis lesions (18 cysts and 20 granulomas) were obtained from 38 patients subjected to periradicular surgery. Some clinical, radiographic, and cone-beam computed tomographic features were recorded. Silanized slides containing paraffin sections were used for the immunohistochemical reactions using anti-IL-17 antibody. Image analysis was performed using an optical microscope, and each sample was divided into 5 high-power fields, which were evaluated for the expression of IL-17 in the epithelium and connective tissues. Results were evaluated for correlations with the lesion size and the occurrence of symptoms and sinus tract. RESULTS: Expression of IL-17 was significantly higher in cysts than in granulomas (P = .02). Among the periradicular cysts, a thin epithelium showed significantly increased labeling for IL-17 when compared with a hyperplastic epithelium (P = .003). IL-17 expression was usually associated with focal accumulations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. No association of IL-17 expression with symptoms, sinus tract, or lesion size was observed (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study reinforces the notion that IL-17 may take part in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis lesions. A role in the exacerbation of chronic inflammation and cyst formation is suspected. Further studies are required to shed light on the specific functions of IL-17 in periradicular inflammatory processes."

Here, we present a computerised decision support framework for discrimination between GBM and solitary MET using MRI, which includes: (i) a semi-automatic segmentation method based on diffusion tensor imaging; (ii) two-dimensional morphological feature extraction and selection; and (iii) a pattern recognition module for automated tumour classification. Ground truth was provided by histopathological analysis from pre-treatment stereotactic biopsy or at surgical resection. Our two-dimensional morphological analysis outperforms previous methods with high cross-validation accuracy of 97.9% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.975 using a neural networks-based classifier."

The dogs were then randomly assigned to one of the following groups: hemodynamic insult + elastase insult group ( n = 6), hemodynamic insult group (n = 6), or elastase control group (n = 3), in which the straight common carotid arteries were subjected to elastase alone. Angiography and hemodynamic analysis were performed immediately and at 12 weeks after surgery; the animals were then killed for histologic evaluation. The 12 surgically reconstructed distal internal carotid arteries simulated the human artery well with respect to geometric and hemodynamic measurements, with the intended aneurysm sites exposed to higher wall shear stress and velocity, lower pressure, turbulent flow, and changes in wall shear stress gradient. Nascent aneurysms developed in 4 hemodynamic insult + elastase insult group dogs at 12 weeks; blood flow analysis demonstrated decreased wall shear stress, increased pressure, and wall shear stress gradient from the neck to the dome. Arterial wall remodeling or nascent aneurysm formation in the hemodynamic insult + elastase insult group versus the other groups was indicated by internal elastic lamina/elastic fiber disruption, muscular layer thinning, increased smooth muscle cell proliferation, macrophage infiltration, and high expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in the media. These data suggest that nascent aneurysms were caused by the combination of arterial wall degeneration and hemodynamic perturbations in this distal internal carotid artery dog model."

The goal of this study was to compare enhancement of brain cancer contrast using reflectance and fluorescence confocal imaging of two fluorophores, methylene blue (MB) and demeclocycline (DMN). MB absorbs light in the red spectral range and fluoresces in the near-infrared. It is safe for in vivo staining of human skin and breast tissue. However, its safety for staining human brain is questionable. Thus, DMN, which absorbs light in the violet spectral range and fluoresces between 470 and 570 nm, could provide a safer alternative to MB. Fresh human gliomas, obtained from surgeries, were cut in half and stained with aqueous solutions of MB and DMN, respectively. Stained tissues were imaged using multimodal confocal microscopy. Resulting reflectance and fluorescence optical images were compared with hematoxylin and eosin histopathology, processed from each imaged tissue. Results indicate that images of tissues stained with either stain exhibit comparable contrast and resolution of morphological detail. Further studies are required to establish the safety and efficacy of these contrast agents for use in human brain."

To quantitate the remodeling, we implement a form of texture analysis to delineate the collagen fibrillar morphology observed in second harmonic generation microscopy images of human normal and high grade malignant ovarian tissues. In the learning stage, a dictionary of ""textons""-frequently occurring texture features that are identified by measuring the image response to a filter bank of various shapes, sizes, and orientations-is created. By calculating a representative model based on the texton distribution for each tissue type using a training set of respective second harmonic generation images, we then perform classification between images of normal and high grade malignant ovarian tissues. By optimizing the number of textons and nearest neighbors, we achieved classification accuracy up to 97% based on the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (true positives versus false positives). The local analysis algorithm is a more general method to probe rapidly changing fibrillar morphologies than global analyses such as FFT. It is also more versatile than other texture approaches as the filter bank can be highly tailored to specific applications (e.g., different disease states) by creating customized libraries based on common image features."

The detection of soma volume and neurite outgrowth of living neurons is a highly relevant biomarker related to various application fields, including therapy efficacy and drug safety evaluation. Through the use of digital holographic microscopy (DHM), we may evaluate the therapeutic effect of CHMs in curing neurodegeneration. Panax ginseng has been used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for centuries. In this study, DHM is applied to monitor the three-dimensional morphology change of retinoic acid-induced human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells during Panax ginseng treatment. We demonstrate the capability of DHM to detect noninvasively SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis and rescue through the measurement of neuronal volume and neurite outgrowth regulation without any labeling reagent. Through DHM, we observed the phase images of the rapidly shrinking cells with decreasing soma volume and shortening neurite outgrowth during glutamate treatments. Then shrinkage in glutamate-induced cells is significantly alleviated during Panax ginseng treatment. The results through DHM are consistent with the result from MTT assay for assessing cell viability during Panax ginseng treatment. Thus, we suggest that application of DHM for measuring soma volume and neurite outgrowth of living neurons may be one appropriate therapeutic evaluation for CHMs."

METHODS: QAES particles were synthesized by the cocondensation of tetraethoxysilane with 2 trialkoxysilanes (3-[trimethoxysilyl]propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride and 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) through a 1-pot sol-gel route. Dried QAES particles were then characterized by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. AH Plus sealers incorporated with 0-8 wt% QAES were tested after 4 weeks of water aging to assess the in vitro antibacterial activity against E. faecalis by the direct contact test (DCT) and 3-dimensional image analysis of live/dead-stained E. faecalis biofilms using confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum of QAES particles revealed the coexistence of the characteristic absorbance band of the siloxane backbone (Si-O-Si) from 1,000-1,100 cm(-1), epoxide band peaking at  approximately 916 cm(-1), and C-N stretching vibration peaking at 1,373 cm(-1). The scanning electron microscopic image showed the spherical morphology of QAES particles with  approximately 120 nm in diameter and a rough surface. DCT results revealed that AH Plus alone (0 wt% QAES) after 4 weeks of water aging had no inhibitory effect on E. faecalis growth (P = .569). AH Plus incorporated with QAES (2-8 wt%) showed antibacterial activity against E. faecalis as shown in DCT and biofilm viability results (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of QAES into epoxy resin-based AH Plus may be a promising approach for controlling endodontic infection at the time of canal filling and preventing subsequent reinfection."

It extends our early observations on the presence of gray matter areas that host strong substance P (SP) immunoreactivity in the territory of the human Cu and adjacent cuneate fascicle. Here we provide a three-dimensional reconstruction of the Cu fields rich in SP and further identify those areas by means of their immunoreactivity to the neuropeptides SP, calcitonin gene-related peptide, methionine- and leucine-enkephalin, peptide histidine-isoleucine, somatostatin and galanin, to the trophins glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and to the neuroplasticity proteins polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule and growth-associated protein-43. The presence, density and distribution of immunoreactivity for each of these molecules closely resemble those occurring in the superficial layers of the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5C). Myelin and Nissl stainings suggest that those Cu subregions and the Sp5C superficial layers share a similar histological aspect. This work establishes the existence of definite subregions, localized within the Cu territory, that bear the neurochemical and histological features of sensory nuclei committed to the neurotransmission of protopathic stimuli, including pain. These findings appear of particular interest when considering that functional, preclinical and clinical studies show that the dorsal column nuclei, classical relay station of fine somatic tactile and proprioceptive sensory stimuli, are also involved in pain neurotransmission."

Epub 2013 Nov 25.,Bonekamp D,J Magn Reson Imaging,2014,2014/07/04,,,10.1002/jmri.24472,"PURPOSE: Noninvasive markers have been developed to reduce the need for liver biopsy. The aim of this study was to compare the strength of association of the arterial enhancement fraction (AEF), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and serum biomarkers for staging hepatic fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients with chronic liver disease underwent triple-phase contrast-enhanced MRI, used to calculate AEF, and diffusion-weighted MRI (b = 0,750 s/mm(2) ), used to calculate ADC. Hepatic fibrosis was staged according METAVIR criteria. The overall association of the four biomarkers (AEF, ADC, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index [APRI]) was compared using nonparametric tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, using histopathologic analysis as the reference standard. RESULTS: AEF and ADC values differed significantly between histopathologic fibrosis stages. AEF values correlated with fibrosis stage, ADC values correlated negatively with fibrosis stage. Compared with ADC, AEF showed a trend toward an improved capability of discriminating fibrosis stages. A weighted composite score of AEF and ADC had significantly better diagnostic accuracy than ADC alone (P </= 0.023). Imaging parameters had a significantly better diagnostic accuracy than AST/ALT ratio or APRI. CONCLUSION: AEF may be able to detect the presence of mild, moderate, and advanced liver fibrosis, and its value is increased with concomitant use of ADC."

Epub 2014 Jul 25.,Fatima K,Microsc Res Tech,2014,2014/07/26,,,10.1002/jemt.22409,"Over the past decade, computer-aided diagnosis is rapidly growing due to the availability of patient data, sophisticated image acquisition tools and advancement in image processing and machine learning algorithms. Meningiomas are the tumors of brain and spinal cord. They account for 20% of all the brain tumors. Meningioma subtype classification involves the classification of benign meningioma into four major subtypes: meningothelial, fibroblastic, transitional, and psammomatous. Under the microscope, the histology images of these four subtypes show a variety of textural and structural characteristics. High intraclass and low interclass variabilities in meningioma subtypes make it an extremely complex classification problem. A number of techniques have been proposed for meningioma subtype classification with varying performances on different subtypes. Most of these techniques employed wavelet packet transforms for textural features extraction and analysis of meningioma histology images. In this article, a hybrid classification technique based on texture and shape characteristics is proposed for the classification of meningioma subtypes. Meningothelial and fibroblastic subtypes are classified on the basis of nuclei shapes while grey-level co-occurrence matrix textural features are used to train a multilayer perceptron for the classification of transitional and psammomatous subtypes. On the whole, average classification accuracy of 92.50% is achieved through the proposed hybrid classifier; which to the best of our knowledge is the highest."

This study was designed to investigate the mammography finding of HER2-positive breast cancer and to compare the results with the characteristics of HER2-negative breast cancer patients. From January 2010 to October 2011, mammography findings of 65 patients with pathologically confirmed HER2-positive breast cancers (n = 22) or HER2-negative breast cancers (n = 43) were retrospectively reviewed. The authors also reviewed pathological reports for information on the histological type and differentiation grade. Among the two types of breast cancer patients, estrogen receptor-negative/PR-negative/HER2-positive breast cancer patients most commonly had associated calcifications (18 of 22) on mammography. On mammography, cases with a cluster of calcifications usually were presented as pleomorphic calcifications (12 of 20) and branching calcifications (4 of 20). Patients with HER2-positive breast cancers showed a histological grade II. HER2-positive breast cancer patients usually had ductal invasive carcinoma (17 of 22). Moreover, postmenopausal patients showed a significantly higher frequency of HER2-positive tumours. Our results suggest that the imaging findings might be useful in diagnosing HER2-positive breast cancer patients."

Epub 2014 Sep 16.,Putzu L,Artif Intell Med,2014,2014/09/23,,,10.1016/j.artmed.2014.09.002,"INTRODUCTION: The counting and classification of blood cells allow for the evaluation and diagnosis of a vast number of diseases. The analysis of white blood cells (WBCs) allows for the detection of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a blood cancer that can be fatal if left untreated. Currently, the morphological analysis of blood cells is performed manually by skilled operators. However, this method has numerous drawbacks, such as slow analysis, non-standard accuracy, and dependences on the operator's skill. Few examples of automated systems that can analyse and classify blood cells have been reported in the literature, and most of these systems are only partially developed. This paper presents a complete and fully automated method for WBC identification and classification using microscopic images. METHODS: In contrast to other approaches that identify the nuclei first, which are more prominent than other components, the proposed approach isolates the whole leucocyte and then separates the nucleus and cytoplasm. This approach is necessary to analyse each cell component in detail. From each cell component, different features, such as shape, colour and texture, are extracted using a new approach for background pixel removal. This feature set was used to train different classification models in order to determine which one is most suitable for the detection of leukaemia. RESULTS: Using our method, 245 of 267 total leucocytes were properly identified (92% accuracy) from 33 images taken with the same camera and under the same lighting conditions. Performing this evaluation using different classification models allowed us to establish that the support vector machine with a Gaussian radial basis kernel is the most suitable model for the identification of ALL, with an accuracy of 93% and a sensitivity of 98%. Furthermore, we evaluated the goodness of our new feature set, which displayed better performance with each evaluated classification model. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method permits the analysis of blood cells automatically via image processing techniques, and it represents a medical tool to avoid the numerous drawbacks associated with manual observation. This process could also be used for counting, as it provides excellent performance and allows for early diagnostic suspicion, which can then be confirmed by a haematologist through specialised techniques."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study cohort included all pathologically proven solid renal masses that underwent pretreatment four-phase MDCT at our institution from 2001 to 2012. Both retrospective qualitative analysis (blinded dual-radiologist evaluation of morphologic features: enhancement pattern, lesion contour, neovascularity, and calcification) and quantitative analysis (mean absolute and relative attenuation and changes in attenuation across phases) were performed. ANOVA with post-hoc analysis, Pearson chi-square tests, and ROC analysis were used. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six consecutive patients (99 men, 57 women) with a mean age of 62.7 years (range, 26-91 years) had 165 solid renal masses (median size, 3.0 cm): 86 clear cell RCCs, 36 papillary RCCs, 10 chromophobe RCCs, 23 oncocytomas, and 10 lipid-poor angiomyolipomas. Kappa for interradiologist agreement regarding morphologic features was 0.33-0.76. There were significant associations between histologic subtype and enhancement pattern (p < 0.001), lesion contour (p < 0.014), and neovascularity (p < 0.001). Clear cell RCC had the highest mean relative corticomedullary attenuation (p < 0.02). Clear cell RCC had greater deenhancement than oncocytoma (p < 0.001); deenhancement less than 50 HU or relative corticomedullary attenuation greater than 0% differentiated clear cell RCC from oncocytoma with a positive predictive value of 90%. Lipid-poor angiomyolipoma had the highest mean absolute unenhanced attenuation (p < 0.01); absolute unenhanced attenuation greater than 45 HU and relative corticomedullary attenuation less than 10% differentiated lipid-poor angiomyolipoma from clear cell RCC with a negative predictive value of 97%. CONCLUSION: Four-phase MDCT renal attenuation profiles enable differentiation of clear cell RCC from other solid renal cortical masses, most notably papillary RCC and lipid-poor angiomyolipoma."

We have earlier invented the Chromatin In Situ Proximity (ChrISP) technique to determine proximities between chromatin fibers within a single chromosome. Here we used ChrISP to identify chromosome 11-specific hubs that are enriched in the H3K9me2 mark and that project toward the nuclear membrane in finger-like structures. Conversely, chromosome 11-specfic chromatin hubs, visualized by the presence of either H3K9me1 or H3K9me3 marks, are chromosome-wide and largely absent at the nuclear periphery. As the nuclear periphery-specific chromatin hubs were lost in the induced reduction of H3K9me2 levels, they likely represent Large Organization Chromatin in Lysine Methylation (LOCK) domains, previously identified by ChIP-seq analysis. Strikingly, the downregulation of the H3K9me2/3 marks also led to the chromosome-wide compaction of chromosome 11, suggesting a pleiotropic function of these features not recognized before. The ChrISP-mediated visualization of dynamic chromatin states in single cells thus provides an analysis of chromatin structures with a resolution far exceeding that of any other light microscopic technique."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four lesions in 103 patients (mean age: 57 +/- 14 years) were evaluated by MR DKI performed with 7 b-values of 0, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 s/mm2 and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging. Breast lesions were histologically characterized and DKI related parameters--mean diffusivity (MD) and mean kurtosis (MK)--were measured. The MD and MK in normal fibroglandular breast tissue, benign and malignant lesions were compared by One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple comparison test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of MD and MK in the diagnosis of breast lesions. RESULTS: The benign lesions (n = 42) and malignant lesions (n = 82) had mean diameters of 11.4 +/- 3.4 mm and 35.8 +/- 20.1 mm, respectively. The MK for malignant lesions (0.88 +/- 0.17) was significantly higher than that for benign lesions (0.47 +/- 0.14) (P < 0.001), and, in contrast, MD for benign lesions (1.97 +/- 0.35 (10(-3) mm2/s)) was higher than that for malignant lesions (1.20 +/- 0.31 (10(-3) mm2/s)) (P < 0.001). At a cutoff MD/MK 1.58 (10(-3) mm2/s)/0.69, sensitivity and specificity of MD/MK for the diagnosis of malignant were 79.3%/84.2% and 92.9%/92.9%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.86/0.92 for MD/MK. CONCLUSIONS: DKI could provide valuable information on the diffusion properties related to tumor microenvironment and increase diagnostic confidence of breast tumors."

METHODS: Thirteen normal and four keratoconic corneas were examined. Collagen lamellae in tissue blocks from the central cornea were visualized by second harmonic generation imaging microscopy. Images obtained in 1-mum steps from BL to Descemet's membrane (DM) were subjected to three-dimensional reconstruction. The reconstructed data sets were divided into 10 layers of equal depth (L1-L10) for analysis. The width of lamellae adherent to BL (L0) was also determined. RESULTS: For the normal cornea, the width (mean +/- SD) of collagen lamellae was 6.5 +/- 1.7 mum at L0, decreased to 4.3 +/- 1.3 mum at L1, and then increased gradually with progression toward DM to 122.2 +/- 34.5 mum at L10, whereas the angle of lamellae was 20.9 degrees  +/- 5.4 degrees  at L1 and decreased initially to 10.6 degrees  +/- 3.2 degrees  at L2 before declining gradually to 2.7 degrees  +/- 2.2 degrees  at L10. The width and angle of collagen lamellae in the keratoconic cornea were significantly larger and smaller, respectively, relative to those in the normal cornea. CONCLUSIONS: In the normal human cornea, collagen lamellae adjacent to BL are narrow and form a steep angle with BL, whereas they increase in width and their angle relative to BL flattens with progression toward DM. These properties of collagen lamellae are altered in keratoconus and are likely related to abnormalities of corneal shape."
24998324,The effect of dentifrice abrasion on denture topography and the subsequent retention of microorganisms on abraded surfaces,"Verran J, Jackson S, Coulthwaite L, Scallan A, Loewy Z, Whitehead K.",J Prosthet Dent. 2014 Dec;112(6):1513-22. doi: 10.1016/j.prosdent.2014.05.009. Epub 2014 Jul 4.,Verran J,J Prosthet Dent,2014,2014/07/08,,,10.1016/j.prosdent.2014.05.009,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Denture surfaces provide hard nonshedding niches for the adhesion and subsequent accumulation of oral microorganisms into denture plaque, which can harbor various potential pathogens linked with oral mucosal lesions and inhalation pneumonia. The initial adhesion is the prerequisite for subsequent biofilm growth, and surface roughness niches facilitate this process by trapping cells. Retained microorganisms are then able to proliferate when the denture is returned to the oral cavity. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the amount and strength of the attachment of microorganisms to a roughened denture acrylic resin surface. An increase in surface roughness increases the retention of microorganisms and a greater amount of cell-surface contact interface may increase the strength of adhesion and, therefore, retention. Cleaning denture surfaces with brushes and dentifrices can influence the denture surface topography and, therefore, may affect retention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Denture acrylic resin specimens were abraded to provide different surface roughness. The amount of attachment of Streptococcus oralis or Candida albicans to these surfaces was assessed by measuring the area of a microscopic field covered by stained cells after 1 hour of incubation. The strength of attachment was assessed with atomic force microscopy, whereby an increasing force was applied to the attached cells until they detached from the surface. RESULTS: Both bacteria and yeast cells were retained in increasing amounts on surfaces of increasing roughness. Cells were most strongly attached on surfaces whose linear features (scratches) were of comparable size with the cells (the streptococci on the low-abraded surfaces, and the yeast on high-abraded surfaces). CONCLUSION: Analysis of findings reveal that even small abrasions may enhance retention on denture surfaces and reduce surface cleanability. The strength of attachment instead of the amount is more important in terms of surface hygiene."

Epub 2014 Sep 16.,Dyrby TB,Neuroimage,2014,2014/09/16,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.09.005,"Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is used to study white-matter fibre organisation, orientation and structural connectivity by means of fibre reconstruction algorithms and tractography. For clinical settings, limited scan time compromises the possibilities to achieve high image resolution for finer anatomical details and signal-to-noise-ratio for reliable fibre reconstruction. We assessed the potential benefits of interpolating DWI datasets to a higher image resolution before fibre reconstruction using a diffusion tensor model. Simulations of straight and curved crossing tracts smaller than or equal to the voxel size showed that conventional higher-order interpolation methods improved the geometrical representation of white-matter tracts with reduced partial-volume-effect (PVE), except at tract boundaries. Simulations and interpolation of ex-vivo monkey brain DWI datasets revealed that conventional interpolation methods fail to disentangle fine anatomical details if PVE is too pronounced in the original data. As for validation we used ex-vivo DWI datasets acquired at various image resolutions as well as Nissl-stained sections. Increasing the image resolution by a factor of eight yielded finer geometrical resolution and more anatomical details in complex regions such as tract boundaries and cortical layers, which are normally only visualized at higher image resolutions. Similar results were found with typical clinical human DWI dataset. However, a possible bias in quantitative values imposed by the interpolation method used should be considered. The results indicate that conventional interpolation methods can be successfully applied to DWI datasets for mining anatomical details that are normally seen only at higher resolutions, which will aid in tractography and microstructural mapping of tissue compartments."

The selective laser melting system was recently developed to fabricate biomedical components from titanium alloys. However, the fabrication of a titanium alloy framework for a maxillary complete denture by selective laser melting has not yet been investigated. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to fabricate thin titanium alloy frameworks for a maxillary complete denture with a selective laser melting system and to evaluate their hardness and microstructure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cast of an edentulous maxilla was scanned with a dental 3-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography system, and standard triangulation language data were produced with the DICOM Viewer (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). Two types of metal frameworks for complete dentures were designed with 3-dimensional computer-aided design software. Two titanium alloy frameworks, SLM-1 and SLM-2, were fabricated from these designs with the selective laser melting system. Plate-shaped specimens were cut from the central flat region of SLM-1, SLM-2, and as-cast Ti-6Al-4V (As-cast). Vickers hardness testing, optical microscopy, and x-ray diffraction measurements were performed. RESULTS: Thin titanium alloy frameworks for maxillary complete dentures could be fabricated by selective laser melting. The hardness values for SLM-1 and SLM-2 were higher than that for the as-cast specimen. Optical microscopy images of the SLM-1 and SLM-2 microstructure showed that the specimens did not exhibit pores, indicating that dense frameworks were successfully obtained with the selective laser melting process. In the x-ray diffraction patterns, only peaks associated with the alpha phase were observed for SLM-1 and SLM-2. In addition, the lattice parameters for SLM-1 and SLM-2 were slightly larger than those for the as-cast specimen. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanical properties and microstructure of the denture frameworks prepared by selective laser melting indicate that these dentures are appropriate for clinical use."

The quality of obturation was evaluated by comparing the volumetric percentage of gaps and voids identified from similar canals obturated with gutta-percha and an epoxy resin-based sealer using the same obturation techniques. METHODS: Forty single-rooted premolars with oval-shaped canals were cleaned, shaped, and obturated with 1 of the 4 material/obturation technique combinations (n = 10). Filled canals were scanned with micro-computed tomographic imaging. Reconstructed images were analyzed for the volumetric percentage of gaps and voids at 3 canal levels (0-4, 4-8, and 8-12 mm from the working length). Roots were sectioned at the 4-mm, 8-mm, and 12-mm levels. Scanning electron microscopic images of negative replicas of root sections were examined to quantify the circumferential percentage of interfacial gaps and the area percentage of intracanal voids. Data were analyzed with parametric or nonparametric statistical methods. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found for the volumetric percentage distribution of gaps and voids for ""obturation technique"" but not for ""material."" Significantly higher percentages of gaps and voids were identified in canals obturated with the NGP system using cold lateral compaction. Examination of negative replicas ascribed this difference to a higher area percentage of interfacial gaps rather than more intracanal voids. CONCLUSIONS: Using warm vertical compaction, the NGP system fulfils the objective of 3-dimensional obturation of the canal space in a manner comparable with the results achieved with gutta-percha and a root canal sealer."

Fourier acoustics are used to describe the propagation of ultrasound through a model of tissue that includes reverberation and random scattering in the imaging plane. The theoretical development describes how the near-field tissue layer, transducer aperture properties, and reflectivity function at the focus reduce the spatial coherence of the imaging wave measured at the transducer surface. Simulations are used to propagate the acoustic field through a histologically characterized sample of the human abdomen and to validate the theoretical predictions. In vivo measurements performed with a diagnostic ultrasound scanner demonstrate that simulations and theory closely match the measured spatial coherence characteristics in the human body across the transducer array's entire spatial extent. The theoretical framework and simulations are then used to describe the physics of spatial coherence imaging, a type of ultrasound imaging that measures coherence properties instead of echo brightness. The same echo data from an F/2 transducer was used to generate B-mode and short lag spatial coherence images. For an anechoic lesion at the focus, the contrast-to-noise ratio is 1.21 for conventional B-mode imaging and 1.95 for spatial coherence imaging. It is shown that the contrast in spatial coherence imaging depends on the properties of the near-field tissue layer and the backscattering function in the focal plane."

In connectomics, electron microscopy data is acquired at nanometer-scale resolution and results in very large image volumes of brain tissue that require fully automatic segmentation algorithms to identify cell boundaries. However, these algorithms require hundreds of corrections per cubic micron of tissue. Even though this task is time consuming, it is fairly easy for humans to perform corrections through splitting, merging, and adjusting segments during proofreading. In this paper we present the design and implementation of Mojo, a fully-featured single-user desktop application for proofreading, and Dojo, a multi-user web-based application for collaborative proofreading. We evaluate the accuracy and speed of Mojo, Dojo, and Raveler, a proofreading tool from Janelia Farm, through a quantitative user study. We designed a between-subjects experiment and asked non-experts to proofread neurons in a publicly available connectomics dataset. Our results show a significant improvement of corrections using web-based Dojo, when given the same amount of time. In addition, all participants using Dojo reported better usability. We discuss our findings and provide an analysis of requirements for designing visual proofreading software."

Because of the limited depth of field of optical imaging systems, one of the major challenges in superresolution imaging resides in capturing the 3D nanoscale morphology of the whole cell. Despite many previous attempts to extend the application of photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) techniques into three dimensions, effective localization depths do not typically exceed 1.2 microm. Thus, 3D imaging of whole cells (or even large organelles) still demands sequential acquisition at different axial positions and, therefore, suffers from the combined effects of out-of-focus molecule activation (increased background) and bleaching (loss of detections). Here, we present the use of multifocus microscopy for volumetric multicolor superresolution imaging. By simultaneously imaging nine different focal planes, the multifocus microscope instantaneously captures the distribution of single molecules (either fluorescent proteins or synthetic dyes) throughout an  approximately  4-microm-deep volume, with lateral and axial localization precisions of  approximately  20 and 50 nm, respectively.

The development of computational tools to aid pathologists in the characterization of these lesions would have great diagnostic and clinical value. As a first step to address this issue, we evaluated the ability of computational image analysis to accurately classify DCIS and UDH and to stratify nuclear grade within DCIS. Using 116 breast biopsies diagnosed as DCIS or UDH from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), we developed a computational method to extract 392 features corresponding to the mean and standard deviation in nuclear size and shape, intensity, and texture across 8 color channels. We used L1-regularized logistic regression to build classification models to discriminate DCIS from UDH. The top-performing model contained 22 active features and achieved an AUC of 0.95 in cross-validation on the MGH data-set. We applied this model to an external validation set of 51 breast biopsies diagnosed as DCIS or UDH from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the model achieved an AUC of 0.86. The top-performing model contained active features from all color-spaces and from the three classes of features (morphology, intensity, and texture), suggesting the value of each for prediction. We built models to stratify grade within DCIS and obtained strong performance for stratifying low nuclear grade vs. high nuclear grade DCIS (AUC = 0.98 in cross-validation) with only moderate performance for discriminating low nuclear grade vs. intermediate nuclear grade and intermediate nuclear grade vs. high nuclear grade DCIS (AUC = 0.83 and 0.69, respectively). These data show that computational pathology models can robustly discriminate benign from malignant intraductal proliferative lesions of the breast and may aid pathologists in the diagnosis and classification of these lesions."

The study of developmental variation has been hampered by the lack of quantitative methods for the joint analysis of embryo shape and the spatial distribution of cellular activity within the developing embryo geometry. By drawing from the strength of geometric morphometrics and pixel/voxel-based image analysis, we present a new approach for the biometric analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional embryonic images. Well-differentiated structures are described in terms of their shape, whereas structures with diffuse boundaries, such as emerging cell condensations or molecular gradients, are described as spatial patterns of intensities. We applied this approach to microscopic images of the tail fins of larval and juvenile rainbow trout. Inter-individual variation of shape and cell density was found highly spatially structured across the tail fin and temporally dynamic throughout the investigated period."

Collagen is the main component of the stroma. The purposes of this study were to investigate differences in collagen fibre patterns between tumour-induced stromal tissue and normal stroma, and between high-grade and low-grade breast cancer stroma, using second harmonic generation microscopy. Thirty-seven ductal carcinomas were examined: Twenty-one Luminal A phenotype and sixteen HER2 or Basal-like phenotype. Three regions were examined in each case: intratumoral, juxtatumoral and extratumoral. Two images were captured in each region. Two characteristics of collagen fibres were examined: the degree of straightness, and the degree of alignment. Collagen fibres were visually classified as curly, intermediate or straight, and as parallel or not parallel. The results of angle measurement and visual analysis showed that collagen fibres were straightest in the intratumoral region and curliest in the extratumoral region. Collagen fibres were more parallel in the juxtatumoral region compared to the two other regions. There were no significant differences between high-grade and low-grade tumours. As a breast tumour progresses, collagen fibres appear to straighten and align at the tumour boundary. This could facilitate invasion of the tumour into the surrounding stroma."

Epub 2014 Sep 4.,Gultekin T,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2015,2014/09/10,,,10.1109/TMI.2014.2354373,"In digital pathology, devising effective image representations is crucial to design robust automated diagnosis systems. To this end, many studies have proposed to develop object-based representations, instead of directly using image pixels, since a histopathological image may contain a considerable amount of noise typically at the pixel-level. These previous studies mostly employ color information to define their objects, which approximately represent histological tissue components in an image, and then use the spatial distribution of these objects for image representation and classification. Thus, object definition has a direct effect on the way of representing the image, which in turn affects classification accuracies. In this paper, our aim is to design a classification system for histopathological images. Towards this end, we present a new model for effective representation of these images that will be used by the classification system. The contributions of this model are twofold. First, it introduces a new two-tier tissue decomposition method for defining a set of multityped objects in an image. Different than the previous studies, these objects are defined combining texture, shape, and size information and they may correspond to individual histological tissue components as well as local tissue subregions of different characteristics. As its second contribution, it defines a new metric, which we call dominant blob scale, to characterize the shape and size of an object with a single scalar value. Our experiments on colon tissue images reveal that this new object definition and characterization provides distinguishing representation of normal and cancerous histopathological images, which is effective to obtain more accurate classification results compared to its counterparts."

Epub 2014 Sep 5.,Lee G,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2015,2014/09/10,,,10.1109/TMI.2014.2355175,"In this work, we present a new methodology to facilitate prediction of recurrent prostate cancer (CaP) following radical prostatectomy (RP) via the integration of quantitative image features and protein expression in the excised prostate. Creating a fused predictor from high-dimensional data streams is challenging because the classifier must 1) account for the ""curse of dimensionality"" problem, which hinders classifier performance when the number of features exceeds the number of patient studies and 2) balance potential mismatches in the number of features across different channels to avoid classifier bias towards channels with more features. Our new data integration methodology, supervised Multi-view Canonical Correlation Analysis (sMVCCA), aims to integrate infinite views of highdimensional data to provide more amenable data representations for disease classification. Additionally, we demonstrate sMVCCA using Spearman's rank correlation which, unlike Pearson's correlation, can account for nonlinear correlations and outliers. Forty CaP patients with pathological Gleason scores 6-8 were considered for this study. 21 of these men revealed biochemical recurrence (BCR) following RP, while 19 did not. For each patient, 189 quantitative histomorphometric attributes and 650 protein expression levels were extracted from the primary tumor nodule. The fused histomorphometric/proteomic representation via sMVCCA combined with a random forest classifier predicted BCR with a mean AUC of 0.74 and a maximum AUC of 0.9286. We found sMVCCA to perform statistically significantly (p < 0.05) better than comparative state-of-the-art data fusion strategies for predicting BCR. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated improved BCR-free survival prediction for the sMVCCA-fused classifier as compared to histology or proteomic features alone."

Several computational algorithms and tools are available to track motile cells in time-lapse microscopy images. In contrast, there has only been limited effort towards the development of tools that take advantage of multi-channel microscopy data and facilitate integrative analysis of cell-motility. We have implemented algorithms for detecting, tracking, and analyzing cell motility from multi-channel time-lapse microscopy data. We have integrated these into a MATLAB-based toolset we call TIAM (Tool for Integrative Analysis of Motility). The cells are detected by a hybrid approach involving edge detection and Hough transforms from transmitted light images. Cells are tracked using a modified nearest-neighbor association followed by an optimization routine to join shorter segments. Cell positions are used to perform local segmentation for extracting features from transmitted light, reflection and fluorescence channels and associating them with cells and cell-tracks to facilitate integrative analysis. We found that TIAM accurately captures the motility behavior of T cells and performed better than DYNAMIK, Icy, Imaris, and Volocity in detecting and tracking motile T cells. Extraction of cell-associated features from reflection and fluorescence channels was also accurate with less than 10% median error in measurements. Finally, we obtained novel insights into T cell motility that were critically dependent on the unique capabilities of TIAM. We found that 1) the CD45RO subset of human CD8 T cells moved faster and exhibited an increased propensity to attach to the substratum during CCL21-driven chemokinesis when compared to the CD45RA subset; and 2) attachment area and arrest coefficient during antigen-induced motility of the CD45A subset is correlated with surface density of integrin LFA1 at the contact."

METHODS: Contrast-enhanced sonography was performed in 46 women with 46 sub-1-cm breast lesions scheduled for surgery or biopsy. Histologic results were used as a reference standard. The contrast enhancement pattern, enhancement degree, direction, margin, radial vessels surrounding the lesion, and lesion size discrepancy between contrast-enhanced and conventional sonography were evaluated. RESULTS: The detection rates for increased size, radial vessels surrounding the lesion, and hyperenhancement on contrast-enhanced sonography were significantly higher in the malignant than the benign group (P < .05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for increased size were 72.7%, 80.0%, and 78.2%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for radial vessels surrounding the lesion were 54.5%, 97.1%, and 87.0%. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for hyperenhancement were 81.8%, 60.0%, and 65.0%. No significant difference was found for the enhancement pattern, direction, and margin between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced sonographic features of sub-1-cm breast lesions included increased size on contrast-enhanced sonography, radial vessels surrounding the lesion, and hyperenhancement. Identification of these features is useful for differentiation of small breast lesions."

METHODS: Twenty-four 20-mm-length distal cuts of superelastic (NiTi Force I(R)) and 24 20-mm-length distal cuts of heat-activated (Therma-Ti Lite(R)) nickel-titanium wires (American Orthodontics, Sheboygan, WI, USA) were divided into two equal groups: 12 wire segments left unused and 12 segments passively exposed to oral environment for 1 month. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were used to analyze surface morphology of the wires which were then immersed in artificial saliva for 1 month to determine potential nickel ions' release by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Heat-activated nickel-titanium (NiTi) wires were rougher than superelastic wires, and both types of wires released almost the same amount of Ni ions. After clinical exposure, more surface roughness was recorded for superelastic NiTi wires and heat-activated NiTi wires. However, retrieved superelastic NiTi wires released less Ni ions in artificial saliva after clinical exposure, and the same result was recorded regarding heat-activated wires. CONCLUSIONS: Both types of NiTi wires were obviously affected by oral environment conditions; their surface roughness significantly increased while the amount of the released Ni ions significantly declined."

We evaluated 232 cases using 3D ultrasound. Histological study was performed on 17 cases aged between 8 and 32 weeks pregnancy and compared with imaging results. For the ultrasound study, we chose five anatomical landmarks: the choroid plexus, thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus and island (Sylvian fissure). The histological study was performed on dissected brain specimens preserved in formaldehyde and was followed by immunohistochemical determination in order to complete the picture of the morphological evolution of the structures evaluated. We analyzed the accuracy of the description of marker elements (choroid plexus, thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus and Sylvian fissure) in three-dimensional ultrasound evaluation. This showed a good correlation with the morphological evaluation as well as with the dimensional descriptions from the literature. Histological and immunohistochemical assessment helped complete the picture of the central nervous system development. Highlighting fetal cerebral structures by three-dimensional ultrasound, together with morphological examination helped us create a dynamic array of the central nervous system development."

The main motivation is to interpret a new image (i.e., query image) by searching among a potentially large-scale database of training images in real-time. Hashing methods have been employed because of their promising performance. However, most previous works apply hashing algorithms on the whole images, while the important information of histopathological images usually lies in individual cells. In addition, they usually only hash one type of features, even though it is often necessary to inspect multiple cues of cells. Therefore, we propose a probabilistic-based hashing framework to model multiple cues of cells for accurate analysis of histopathological images. Specifically, each cue of a cell is compressed as binary codes by kernelized and supervised hashing, and the importance of each hash entry is determined adaptively according to its discriminativity, which can be represented as probability scores. Given these scores, we also propose several feature fusion and selection schemes to integrate their strengths. The classification of the whole image is conducted by aggregating the results from multiple cues of all cells. We apply our algorithm on differentiating adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma, i.e., two types of lung cancers, using a large dataset containing thousands of lung microscopic tissue images. It achieves 90.3% accuracy by hashing and retrieving multiple cues of half-million cells."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 271 solid breast masses in 242 women were examined with ARFI, and their shear wave velocities (SWVs), Virtual Touch tissue imaging (VTI) patterns, and area ratios (ARs) were measured and compared with their histopathological outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were calculated to assess diagnostic performance of ARFI for small masses (6-14 mm) and big masses (15-30 mm). RESULTS: SWV of mass was shown to be positively associated with mass size (P < 0.001). For small masses, area under ROC (Az) of AR was larger than that of SWV (P < 0.001) and VTI pattern (P < 0.001); no significant difference was found between Az of SWV and that of VTI pattern (P = 0.906). For big masses, Az of VTI pattern was less than that of SWV (P = 0.008) and AR (P = 0.002); no significant difference was identified between Az of SWV and that of AR (P = 0.584). CONCLUSIONS: For big masses, SWV and AR are both efficient measures; nevertheless, for small masses, AR seems to be the best feature."

We describe a new algorithm combining random walk-based image segmentation with linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based feature detection, using assumptions about the morphology of biological samples to account for phase ambiguities when standard methods have failed. We present three versions of our method: first, a method for LDA image segmentation based on a manually compiled training dataset; second, a method using a random walker (RW) algorithm informed by the assumed properties of a biological phase image; and third, an algorithm which combines LDA-based edge detection with an efficient RW algorithm. We show that the combination of LDA plus the RW algorithm gives the best overall performance with little speed penalty compared to LDA alone, and that this algorithm can be further optimized using a genetic algorithm to yield superior performance for phase unwrapping of QPI data from biological samples."

They have the bilobed or unilobed nucleus and excessive clumping chromatin. Currently, detection of this kind of cell mainly depends on the manual microscopic examination by a clinician, thus, the quality of detection is limited by the efficiency and a certain subjective consciousness of the clinician. In this paper, a detection method for PHA and PPHA is proposed based on karyomorphism and chromatin distribution features. Firstly, the skeleton of the nucleus is extracted using an augmented Fast Marching Method (AFMM) and width distribution is obtained through distance transform. Then, caryoplastin in the nucleus is extracted based on Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier is constructed to analyze the features. Experiment shows that the sensitivity and specificity of this method achieved 87.5% and 83.33%, which means that the detection accuracy of PHA is acceptable. Meanwhile, the detection method should be helpful to the automatic morphological classification of blood cells."

Of special interest were the fabella's occurrence and position, calcium concentration as long-term load intake indicator, and the histology. Within our analysis, fabellae were found in 30.0% of all datasets, located on the upper part of the posterolateral femoral condyle. The region of fabella contact on this condyle showed a significantly lower calcium concentration than its surroundings. Histologically, the fabella showed no articular cartilage but a clearly distinguishable fabellofibular ligament that consisted of two bundles: one, as already described in literature inserted at the fibular tip, and another part newly described on the top of the lateral meniscus. In its role of stabilizing the soft tissue structures of the posterolateral knee, the fabella seems to serve as suspension for the ligaments evolving from its base. Even though a joint formation of any kind is unlikely, the presence of a fabella needs to be kept in mind during knee examination and any surgical procedures."

Ten normotensive and 10 hypertensive male rats were used in this study. Rat penises were processed to obtain smooth muscle immunostained histological slices and photomicrographs captured for analysis. The smooth muscle surface density was measured in both groups by two different observers by the point-counting method and by the color-based segmentation method. Hypertensive rats showed an increase in smooth muscle surface density by the two methods, and no difference was found between the results of the two observers. However, surface density values were higher by the point-counting method. The use of either method did not influence the final interpretation of the results, and both proved to have adequate reproducibility. However, as differences were found between the two methods, results obtained by either method should not be compared."

METHODS: One hundred and twenty pieces of rectangular stainless steel wires (0.43 x 0.64 mm) were randomly assigned into four groups. In each group, there were 15 pieces of bent wires and 15 straight ones. Prior to measurements of the wires, as individual experimental groups (group 1, 2, and 3), the wires were exposed to artificial saliva for 4 weeks at pH 5.6, 6.6, and 7.6, respectively. A control group of wires (group 4) remained in air for the same period of time before sent for measurements. Surface roughness (Ra-value) was measured by a profilometer. Young's modulus and maximum force were determined by a four-point flexural test apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the surface morphology of straight wire. Differences between groups were examined using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Mean surface roughness values, flexural Young's moduli, and maximum force values of bent wires are significantly different from those of the straight wires, which was the main effect of wire bending, ignoring the influence of pH. A significant effect was found between Ra-values regarding the main effect of pH, ignoring the influence of shape. There was a significant interaction effect of bending and pH on flexural Young's moduli of stainless steel archwires, while pH did not show much impact on the maximum force values of those stainless steel wires. Bigger surface irregularities were seen on SEM images of straight wires immersed in artificial saliva at pH 5.6 compared to artificial saliva at other pH values. Surface depth (Rz) was more sensitive than Ra in revealing surface roughness, both measured from 3D reconstructed SEM images. Ra showed a comparable result of surface roughness to Ra-value measured by the profilometer. CONCLUSIONS: Bending has a significant influence on surface roughness and mechanical properties of rectangular SS archwires. pH plays a synergistic effect on the change of mechanical properties of stainless steel (SS) wires along with wire bending."

Quantification of these pathological markers on histological sections is widely performed to study the disease and to evaluate new therapies.

Here, we present a supervised classification approach for the robust pixel-level classification of large neuropathology whole slide images. We propose a weighted form of Random Forest in order to fit nonlinear decision boundaries that take into account class imbalance. Both color and texture descriptors were used as predictors and model selection was performed via a leave-one-image-out cross-validation scheme. Our method showed superior results compared to the current state of the art method when applied to the segmentation of Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in a human brain sample. Furthermore, using parallel computing, our approach easily scales-up to large gigabyte-sized images. To show this, we segmented a whole brain histology dataset of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. This demonstrates our method relevance as a routine tool for whole slide microscopy images analysis in clinical and preclinical research settings."

This paper presents a robust technique for epidermis segmentation in whole slide skin histopathological images. The proposed technique first performs a coarse epidermis segmentation using global thresholding and shape analysis. The epidermis thickness is then estimated by a series of line segments perpendicular to the main axis of the initially segmented epidermis mask. If the segmented epidermis mask has a thickness greater than a predefined threshold, the segmentation is suspected to be inaccurate. A second pass of fine segmentation using k-means algorithm is then carried out over these coarsely segmented result to enhance the performance. Experimental results on 64 different skin histopathological images show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance compared to the existing techniques."

Our data showed that tumor types have distinct morphological and phenotypic patterns: high- and low-grade serous carcinoma, endometrioid, clear cell and mucinous carcinoma. The different subtypes of ovarian carcinomas have different molecular, pathological and clinical characteristics, the histological diversity of epithelial ovarian carcinoma mirroring thus distinct entities not just one disease."

Focal adhesions (FAs) are integrin-based adhesion complexes that form the link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and are thought to orchestrate cell migration. Understanding the regulation of FAs by (oncogenic) signaling pathways may identify strategies to target pathological cell migration. Here we describe the development of a robust FA tracker that enables the automatic, multi-parametric analysis of FA dynamics, morphology and composition from time-lapse image series generated by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In control prostate carcinoma cells, this software recapitulates previous findings that relate morphological characteristics of FAs to their lifetime and their cellular location. We then investigated how FAs are altered when cell migration is induced by the metastasis-promoting hormone HGF and subsequently inhibited by activation of the small GTPase Rap1. We performed a detailed analysis of individual FA parameters, which identified FA size, sliding and intensity as primary targets of Rap1. HGF did not have strong effects on any of the FA parameters within the first hours of its addition. Subsequent Bayesian network inference (BNI), using all measured parameters as input, revealed little correlation between changes in cell migration and FA characteristics in this prostate carcinoma cell line. Instead BNI indicated a concerted coordination of cell size and FA parameters. Thus our results did not reveal a direct relation between the regulation of cell migration and the regulation of FA dynamics."

However, the high susceptibility of EPI towards B0 magnetic field inhomogeneity poses serious challenges. Conventional magnetic field shimming with low-order spherical harmonic (SH) functions is capable of compensating shallow field distortions, but performs poorly for global brain shimming or on specific areas with strong susceptibility-induced B0 distortions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Excellent B0 homogeneity has been demonstrated recently in the human brain at 7 Tesla with the DYNAmic Multi-coIl TEchnique (DYNAMITE) for magnetic field shimming (J Magn Reson (2011) 212:280-288). Here, we report the benefits of DYNAMITE shimming for multi-slice EPI and T2* mapping. A standard deviation of 13Hz was achieved for the residual B0 distribution in the human brain at 7 Tesla with DYNAMITE shimming and was 60% lower compared to conventional shimming that employs static zero through third order SH shapes. The residual field inhomogeneity with SH shimming led to an average 8mm shift at acquisition parameters commonly used for fMRI and was reduced to 1.5-3mm with DYNAMITE shimming. T2* values obtained from the prefrontal and temporal cortices with DYNAMITE shimming were 10-50% longer than those measured with SH shimming. The reduction of the confounding macroscopic B0 field gradients with DYNAMITE shimming thereby promises improved access to the relevant microscopic T2* effects. The combination of high spatial resolution and DYNAMITE shimming allows largely artifact-free EPI and T2* mapping throughout the brain, including prefrontal and temporal lobe areas. DYNAMITE shimming is expected to critically benefit a wide range of MRI applications that rely on excellent B0 magnetic field conditions including EPI-based fMRI to study various cognitive processes and assessing large-scale brain connectivity in vivo. As such, DYNAMITE shimming has the potential to replace conventional SH shim systems in human MR scanners."

A preliminary investigation using structural brain imaging revealed a region of anterior cingulate cortex that was thicker in SuperAgers compared with healthy 50- to 65-year-olds. Here, we investigated the in vivo structural features of cingulate cortex in a larger sample of SuperAgers and conducted a histologic analysis of this region in postmortem specimens. A region-of-interest MRI structural analysis found cingulate cortex to be thinner in cognitively average 80+ year olds (n = 21) than in the healthy middle-aged group (n = 18). A region of the anterior cingulate cortex in the right hemisphere displayed greater thickness in SuperAgers (n = 31) compared with cognitively average 80+ year olds and also to the much younger healthy 50-60 year olds (p < 0.01). Postmortem investigations were conducted in the cingulate cortex in five SuperAgers, five cognitively average elderly individuals, and five individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Compared with other subject groups, SuperAgers showed a lower frequency of Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary tangles (p < 0.05). There were no differences in total neuronal size or count between subject groups. Interestingly, relative to total neuronal packing density, there was a higher density of von Economo neurons (p < 0.05), particularly in anterior cingulate regions of SuperAgers. These findings suggest that reduced vulnerability to the age-related emergence of Alzheimer pathology and higher von Economo neuron density in anterior cingulate cortex may represent biological correlates of high memory capacity in advanced old age."

However, these methods have many limitations and it is necessary to compensate for the insufficiencies of previous methods. The aim of this research was to present sectioned images and surface models that allow the whole courses of III, IV, and VI and circumjacent structures to be observed in detail. To achieve this, the structures of whole courses of III, IV, and VI were traced on the sectioned images, and surface models of the structures were reconstructed. As a result, nucleus of III, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, nucleus of IV, and nucleus of VI and their fibers were identified on brainstem in the sectioned images. In the sectioned images, III, IV, and VI passed both sides of the cavernous sinus and entered at the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. In the sectioned images, III, IV, and VI innervated extraocular muscles in orbit. In surface models, the whole courses of III, IV, and VI and circumjacent structures could be explored freely three-dimensionally. The greatest advantage of the sectioned images was that they allowed the whole courses of III, IV, and VI and circumjacent structures to be observed as real colored in an unbroken line. In addition, the surface models allowed the stereoscopic shapes and positions of III, IV, and VI to be comprehended. The sectioned images and surface models could be applied for medical education purposes or training tools.

Epub 2014 Oct 9.,Zhang X,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2015,2014/10/15,,,10.1109/TMI.2014.2361481,"Automatic analysis of histopathological images has been widely utilized leveraging computational image-processing methods and modern machine learning techniques. Both computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and content-based image-retrieval (CBIR) systems have been successfully developed for diagnosis, disease detection, and decision support in this area. Recently, with the ever-increasing amount of annotated medical data, large-scale and data-driven methods have emerged to offer a promise of bridging the semantic gap between images and diagnostic information. In this paper, we focus on developing scalable image-retrieval techniques to cope intelligently with massive histopathological images. Specifically, we present a supervised kernel hashing technique which leverages a small amount of supervised information in learning to compress a 10 000-dimensional image feature vector into only tens of binary bits with the informative signatures preserved. These binary codes are then indexed into a hash table that enables real-time retrieval of images in a large database. Critically, the supervised information is employed to bridge the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level diagnostic information. We build a scalable image-retrieval framework based on the supervised hashing technique and validate its performance on several thousand histopathological images acquired from breast microscopic tissues. Extensive evaluations are carried out in terms of image classification (i.e., benign versus actionable categorization) and retrieval tests. Our framework achieves about 88.1% classification accuracy as well as promising time efficiency. For example, the framework can execute around 800 queries in only 0.01 s, comparing favorably with other commonly used dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-six histopathologically verified primary malignant breast tumors were retrospectively evaluated in 170 patients. All patients had undergone a standardized 3-T magnetic resonance imaging protocol, containing a diffusion-weighted sequence with 2 b values and a series of dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. Apparent diffusion coefficient was measured manually by a reader blinded to the histopathological results. The ADC values were correlated with histopathological results. Mean ADC values were compared between invasive cancers and DCIS as well as between different tumor grades. Receiver operating characteristics curves were used to calculate diagnostic performance. RESULTS: There were 155 invasive cancers and 21 noninvasive DCIS. Mean (SD) values differed significantly between the invasive cancers (0.9 [0.15] x10 mm/s) and the DCIS (1.24 [0.23] x10 mm/s, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.895 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.840-0.936). A threshold of 1.01 x10 mm/s or less allowed an identification of invasive cancers with a sensitivity of 78.06% (95% CI, 70.7%-84.3%) and a specificity of 90.5% (95% CI, 69.6%-98.8%). No significant ADC differences were found among different tumor grades (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Apparent diffusion coefficient could be used as an imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of breast cancer. It seems to be a valuable noninvasive quantitative biomarker to assess breast cancer invasiveness. Thus, ADC measurements provide the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment."

Invadosomes promote the invasion of cells, ranging from metastatic cancer cells to immune cells, into tissue. Here, we show that neuronal growth cones form protrusions that share molecular, structural and functional characteristics of invadosomes. Growth cones from all neuron types and species examined, including a variety of human neurons, form invadosomes both in vitro and in vivo. Growth cone invadosomes contain dynamic F-actin and several actin regulatory proteins, as well as Tks5 and matrix metalloproteinases, which locally degrade the matrix. When viewed using three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy, F-actin foci often extended together with microtubules within orthogonal protrusions emanating from the growth cone central domain. Finally, inhibiting the function of Tks5 both reduced matrix degradation in vitro and disrupted motoneuron axons from exiting the spinal cord and extending into the periphery. Taken together, our results suggest that growth cones use invadosomes to target protease activity during axon guidance through tissues."

The approach is based on the accurate quantification by image analysis of the integrated nuclear intensity of cells stained with a DNA dye, and it can be used in combination with several histochemical methods. We describe and provide the algorithms for two automated image analysis pipelines and the derivation of cell cycle profiles with both commercial and open-source software. This 1-2-d protocol is applicable to adherent cells, and it is adaptable for use with several DNA dyes."

However, a paucity of basic science evidence has been published to support any particular mechanism that may contribute to reported clinical efficacies of MFR. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of duration and magnitude of MFR strain on wound healing in bioengineered tendons (BETs) in vitro. METHODS: The BETs were cultured on a deformable matrix and then wounded with a steel cutting tip. Using vacuum pressure, they were then strained with a modeled MFR paradigm. The duration of MFR dose consisted of a slow-loading strain that stretched the BETs 6% beyond their resting length, held them for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes, and then slowly released them back to baseline. To assess the effects of MFR magnitude, the BETs were stretched to 0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, or 12% beyond resting length, held for 90 seconds, and then released back to baseline. Repeated measures of BET width and the wound's area, shape, and major and minor axes were quantified using microscopy over a 48-hour period. RESULTS: An 11% and 12% reduction in BET width were observed in groups with a 9% (0.961 mm; P<.01) and 12% (0.952 mm; P<.05) strain, respectively. Reduction of the minor axis of the wound was unrelated to changes in BET width. In the 3% strain group, a statistically significant decrease (-40%; P<.05) in wound size was observed at 24 hours compared with 48 hours in the nonstrain, 6% strain, and 9% strain groups. Longer duration of MFR resulted in rapid decreases in wound size, which were observed as early as 3 hours after strain. CONCLUSION: Wound healing is highly dependent on the duration and magnitude of MFR strain, with a lower magnitude and longer duration leading to the most improvement. The rapid change in wound area observed 3 hours after strain suggests that this phenomenon is likely a result of the modification of the existing matrix protein architecture. These data suggest that MFR's effect on the extracellular matrix can potentially promote wound healing."

In HIV-infected cells, HIV-1 hijacks the ESCRT machinery to drive HIV release. Early in the HIV-1 assembly process, the ESCRT-I protein Tsg101 and the ESCRT-related protein ALIX are recruited to the assembly site. Further downstream, components such as the ESCRT-III proteins CHMP4 and CHMP2 form transient membrane associated lattices, which are involved in virus-host membrane fission. Although various geometries of ESCRT-III assemblies could be observed, the actual membrane constriction and fission mechanism is not fully understood. Fission might be driven from inside the HIV-1 budding neck by narrowing the membranes from the outside by larger lattices surrounding the neck, or from within the bud. Here, we use super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to elucidate the size and structure of the ESCRT components Tsg101, ALIX, CHMP4B and CHMP2A during HIV-1 budding below the diffraction limit. To avoid the deleterious effects of using fusion proteins attached to ESCRT components, we performed measurements on the endogenous protein or, in the case of CHMP4B, constructs modified with the small HA tag. Due to the transient nature of the ESCRT interactions, the fraction of HIV-1 assembly sites with colocalizing ESCRT complexes was low (1.5%-3.4%). All colocalizing ESCRT clusters exhibited closed, circular structures with an average size (full-width at half-maximum) between 45 and 60 nm or a diameter (determined using a Ripley's L-function analysis) of roughly 60 to 100 nm. The size distributions for colocalizing clusters were narrower than for non-colocalizing clusters, and significantly smaller than the HIV-1 bud. Hence, our results support a membrane scission process driven by ESCRT protein assemblies inside a confined structure, such as the bud neck, rather than by large lattices around the neck or in the bud lumen. In the case of ALIX, a cloud of individual molecules surrounding the central clusters was often observed, which we attribute to ALIX molecules incorporated into the nascent HIV-1 Gag shell. Experiments performed using YFP-tagged Tsg101 led to an over 10-fold increase in ESCRT structures colocalizing with HIV-1 budding sites indicating an influence of the fusion protein tag on the function of the ESCRT protein."

Epub 2014 Nov 26.,Lerebours C,Bone,2015,2014/11/30,,,10.1016/j.bone.2014.11.016,"A characteristic relationship for bone between bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and specific surface (BS/TV) has previously been proposed based on 2D histological measurements. This relationship has been suggested to be bone intrinsic, i.e., to not depend on bone type, bone site and health state. In these studies, only limited data comes from cortical bone. The aim of this paper was to investigate the relationship between BV/TV and BS/TV in human cortical bone using high-resolution micro-CT imaging and the correlations with subject-specific biometric data such as height, weight, age and sex. Images from femoral cortical bone samples of the Melbourne Femur Collection were obtained using synchrotron radiation micro-CT (SPring8, Japan). Sixteen bone samples from thirteen individuals were analysed in order to find bone volume fraction values ranging from 0.20 to 1. Finally, morphological models of the tissue microstructure were developed to help explain the relationship between BV/TV and BS/TV. Our experimental findings indicate that the BV/TV vs BS/TV relationship is subject specific rather than intrinsic. Sex and pore density were statistically correlated with the individual curves. However no correlation was found with body height, weight or age. Experimental cortical data points deviate from interpolating curves previously proposed in the literature. However, these curves are largely based on data points from trabecular bone samples. This finding challenges the universality of the curve: highly porous cortical bone is significantly different to trabecular bone of the same porosity. Finally, our morphological models suggest that changes in BV/TV within the same sample can be explained by an increase in pore area rather than in pore density. This is consistent with the proposed mechanisms of age-related endocortical bone loss. In addition, these morphological models highlight that the relationship between BV/TV and BS/TV is not linear at high BV/TV as suggested in the literature but is closer to a square root function."

Single-species biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans and mixed-species biofilms of C albicans plus S mutans were incubated on HA discs for 72 hours to grow mature biofilms. Three different non-biofilm control groups also were established for testing. HA discs were then evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy, micro-computed tomography metrotomography, x-ray spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy with planimetric analysis. In addition, quantitative cultures and pH assessment were performed. Analysis of variance was used to test for significance between treatment and control groups. RESULTS: All investigated biofilms were able to cause significant (P < .05) and morphologically characteristic alterations in HA structure as compared with controls. The highest number of alterations observed was caused by mixed biofilms of C albicans plus S mutans. S mutans biofilm incubated in medium with additional sucrose content was the most detrimental to HA surfaces among single-species biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that direct microbial resorption of bone is possible in addition to immune-mediated destruction, which has important translational implications for the pathogenesis of chronic bone infections and for targeted antimicrobial therapeutics."

Epub 2015 Jan 3.,Weiner KS,Brain Cogn,2015,2015/01/07,PMC4330113,NIHMS654815,10.1016/j.bandc.2014.12.002,"Recently, Hines (2014) wrote an evocative paper challenging findings from both histological and morphological studies of Einstein's brain. In this discussion paper, I extend Hines' theoretical point and further discuss how best to determine 'abnormal' morphology. To do so, I assess the sulcal patterning of Einstein's fusiform gyrus (FG) for the first time. The sulcal patterning of the FG was unconsidered in prior studies because the morphological features of the mid-fusiform sulcus have only been clarified recently. On the one hand, the sulcal patterning of Einstein's FG is abnormal relative to averages of 'normal' brains generated from two independent datasets (N = 39 and N = 15, respectively). On the other hand, within the 108 hemispheres used to make these average brains, it is not impossible to find FG sulcal patterns that resemble those of Einstein. Thus, concluding whether a morphological pattern is normal or abnormal heavily depends on the chosen analysis method (e.g. group average vs. individual). Such findings question the functional meaning of morphological 'abnormalities' when determined by comparing an individual to an average brain or average frequency characteristics. These observations are not only important for analyzing a rare brain such as that of Einstein, but also for comparing macroanatomical features between typical and atypical populations."

METHODS: At routine mammography, additional CC views were obtained with about 10% of the standard dose. Five radiologists retrospectively read the standard [mediolateral oblique (MLO) + CC] and combination low-dose mammograms (standard MLO + low-dose CC). If present, lesion type, conspicuity and suggested work-up were recorded. Final diagnoses were made by histology or follow up. A t-test or chi(2) test was used to compare results. RESULTS: 421 cases were included, presenting 5 malignancies, 66 benign lesions and multiple non-specific radiologic features. Using MLO with low-dose CC, all lesions were detected by at least one reader, but altogether less often than with standard mammography (sensitivity, 73.9% vs 81.5%). Missed lesions concerned all types. Lesions detected with both protocols were described similarly (p = 0.084) with comparable work-up recommendations (p = 0.658). CONCLUSION: Mammography with ultra-low-dose CC images particularly influences detection. While sensitivity decreased, specificity was unaffected. In this proof-of-concept study a lower limit was to be determined that is not intended nor applicable for clinical practice. This should facilitate further research in optimization of a low-dose approach, which has potential in a relatively young and largely asymptomatic population. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Tungsten/silver-acquired mammography images might facilitate substantial dose reduction. Ultra-low-dose CC images reduce sensitivity, but not specificity. Low-dose images have potential in a largely young and asymptomatic population; a baseline is set for further research in optimization of a low-dose approach."

Proliferation index has served as a supplemental tool in assessing the malignant potential of adrenocortical tumors. None of the current histologic classification systems can sufficiently accurately predict tumors' metastatic potential. We studied 177 consecutive adult patients with primary adrenocortical tumors operated on at Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1990 and 2003, all patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. We determined for each tumor the Weiss score and the Weiss revisited score by Aubert. Proliferation index was measured by computer-assisted image analysis. Each of the 9 Weiss criteria and the proliferation index were then used to establish a scoring system to predict the metastatic potential of adrenocortical tumors. Use of stepwise regression analysis led us to propose a calculation: 3 x mitotic rate (>5/50 high-power fields) + 5 x presence of necrosis + proliferation index in the most proliferative area of the tumor. Using a cutoff value of 8.5, the new scoring system was able to diagnose metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma with 100% sensitivity (confidence interval [CI], 76.8%-100%) and 99.4% specificity (CI, 96.6%-100%). The corresponding sensitivity of the Weiss system was 100% (CI, 76.8%-100%), and specificity, 90.2% (CI, 84.6%-94.3%), with sensitivity of the Weiss revisited system at 100% (CI, 76.8%-100%) and specificity at 96.9% (CI, 93.0%-99.0%). The new Helsinki score thus was accurate in predicting the metastatic potential of adrenocortical tumors."

The distinction between balanced and unbalanced spermatozoa on morphological criteria is still unfeasible. However, we previously showed that: i) spermatozoa with an unbalanced content have a higher rate of DNA fragmentation; and ii) that density gradient centrifugation partially separates balanced from unbalanced sperm cells. We hypothesized that a chromosomal imbalance could alter the fine spermatic nuclear architecture and consequently the condensation of DNA, thus modifying normal sperm density. Spermatic nuclear volumes in four translocation carriers were analyzed using confocal microscopy. Secondarily, FISH analysis was used to establish the segregation mode of each spermatozoon. We found the average spermatic nuclei size to be higher among unbalanced spermatozoa in all patients but one. All the unbalanced modes were associated with larger nuclei in two patients, while this was the case for the 3:1 mode only in the other two, suggesting an abnormal condensation. This could be the first step in elaborating a procedure to completely eliminate unbalanced spermatozoa from semen prior to in vitro fertilization."

Furthermore, it shows a reduced sensitivity to over-segmentation errors and uneven illumination, that are typical issues of IIF imaging."

Epub 2015 Feb 16.,Jitaree S,Scanning,2015,2015/02/18,,,10.1002/sca.21191,"Having a classifier of cell types in a breast cancer microscopic image (BCMI), obtained with immunohistochemical staining, is required as part of a computer-aided system that counts the cancer cells in such BCMI. Such quantitation by cell counting is very useful in supporting decisions and planning of the medical treatment of breast cancer. This study proposes and evaluates features based on texture analysis by fractal dimension (FD), for the classification of histological structures in a BCMI into either cancer cells or non-cancer cells. The cancer cells include positive cells (PC) and negative cells (NC), while the normal cells comprise stromal cells (SC) and lymphocyte cells (LC). The FD feature values were calculated with the box-counting method from binarized images, obtained by automatic thresholding with Otsu's method of the grayscale images for various color channels. A total of 12 color channels from four color spaces (RGB, CIE-L*a*b*, HSV, and YCbCr) were investigated, and the FD feature values from them were used with decision tree classifiers. The BCMI data consisted of 1,400, 1,200, and 800 images with pixel resolutions 128 x 128, 192 x 192, and 256 x 256, respectively. The best cross-validated classification accuracy was 93.87%, for distinguishing between cancer and non-cancer cells, obtained using the Cr color channel with window size 256. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm, based on fractal dimension features extracted from a color channel, performs well in the automatic classification of the histology in a BCMI. This might support accurate automatic cell counting in a computer-assisted system for breast cancer diagnosis."

On twenty-six cancer patients, we collected two-dimensional optical mammograms and created maps of the concentrations of hemoglobin, water, and lipids, as well as the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. For each cancerous breast, we analyzed the difference between the tumor region (as identified by x-ray and optical mammography) and the remainder of breast tissue. With respect to the surrounding tissue, we found that cancer regions have significantly higher concentrations of total hemoglobin (+2.4 +/- 0.4 muM) and water (+7 +/- 1% v/v), and significantly lower lipid concentration (8 +/- 2% v/v) and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (5 +/- 1%). We also found a significant correlation between the tumor optical contrast and the grade of breast cancer as quantified by the Nottingham histologic score; this demonstrates how optical signatures may be representative of metabolic and morphological features, as well as the aggressive potential of the tumor."

METHODS: We established lung metastatic models of human gastric cancer by injecting the moderately differentiated SGC-7901 gastric cancer cell line into the tail vein of nude mice. Samples were embedded in a 10% formalin suspension and dried before imaging. Grating-based X-ray phase-contrast images were obtained at the BL13W beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) and compared with histological sections. RESULTS: Without contrast agents, grating-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging still differentiated angiogenesis within metastatic tumors with high spatial resolution. Vessels, down to tens of microns, showed gray values that were distinctive from those of the surrounding tumors, which made them easily identifiable. The vessels depicted in the imaging study were similar to those identified on histopathology, both in size and shape. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary study demonstrates that grating-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging has the potential to depict angiogenesis in lung metastases."

A clinical decision support system that exploits the subbands' textural fractal characteristics for best bases selection of meningioma brain histopathological image classification is proposed. Each subband is analysed using its fractal dimension instead of energy, which has the advantage of being less sensitive to image intensity and abrupt changes in tissue texture. The most significant subband that best identifies texture discontinuities will be chosen for further decomposition, and its fractal characteristics would represent the optimal feature vector for classification. The performance was tested using the support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifiers and a leave-one-patient-out method was employed for validation. Our method outperformed the classical energy based selection approaches, achieving for SVM, Bayesian and kNN classifiers an overall classification accuracy of 94.12%, 92.50% and 79.70%, as compared to 86.31%, 83.19% and 51.63% for the co-occurrence matrix, and 76.01%, 73.50% and 50.69% for the energy texture signatures; respectively. These results indicate the potential usefulness as a decision support system that could complement radiologists' diagnostic capability to discriminate higher order statistical textural information; for which it would be otherwise difficult via ordinary human vision."

The sparse coding based linear spatial pyramid matching (ScSPM) and its variants are popular for grayscale image classification, but cannot extract color information. In this paper, we propose a joint sparse coding based SPM (JScSPM) method for the classification of color medical images. A joint dictionary can represent both the color information in each color channel and the correlation between channels. Consequently, the joint sparse codes calculated from a joint dictionary can carry color information, and therefore this method can easily transform a feature descriptor originally designed for grayscale images to a color descriptor. A color hepatocellular carcinoma histological image dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed JScSPM algorithm. Experimental results show that JScSPM provides significant improvements as compared with the majority voting based ScSPM and the original ScSPM for color medical image classification."

In immunofluorescence, the IENF count is performed typically by computer-assisted nerve tracing on confocal images. Alternatively, the count can be performed directly through the oculars of a standard epifluorescence microscope. We specifically compared measures obtained using the 2 methods. METHODS: We compared measures of IENF density in the same 50 skin samples using computer-assisted image analysis and direct count. RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between the 2 methods. Linear regression showed a slope between paired measures virtually equal to 1 (beta = 0.99). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference (offset) between the measures of 0.46 +/- 0.91 fibers/mm. CONCLUSIONS: Direct observation with epifluorescence microscopy proved as reliable as the more time-consuming 3-dimensional computer-assisted analysis of confocal digital images for determining IENF density."

In this model, biopsies are performed at the end of the occlusion period for morphological and immuno-histochemistry analysis. Multiphoton microscopy is a recent non-invasive imaging technique that combined with image processing tools allows the in vivo quantification of human skin modifications. OBJECTIVE: To validate with gold standards of anti-ageing that are retinoids, the relevance of multiphoton microscopy for kinetic and quantitative assessment in this model. METHODS: Twenty women, aged 50-65 years, were enrolled. Retinol 0.3% (RO) and Retinoic acid 0.025% (RA) were applied to the dorsal photo-damaged side of their forearm under occlusive patches for 12 days. A patch alone was applied to a third area as control. Evaluation was performed at day D0, D12 (end of treatment), D18 and D32 using multiphoton microscopy. Epidermal thickness, normalized area of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and melanin density were estimated using 3D image processing tools. RESULTS: Main significant results are: Epidermal thickening at D12, D18 and D32 with RO and at D12, D18 with RA vs. baseline and vs. CONTROL: Increased DEJ undulation at D32 with RO and at D12 with RA vs. baseline and vs. CONTROL: Decreased melanin content with RO (at D12 and D18 vs. baseline and at D32 vs. baseline and vs. control) and with RA (at D12 vs. baseline). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that multiphoton microscopy associated to specific 3D image processing tools allows cutaneous effects induced by topical retinoids in this in vivo model to be non-invasively detected, quantified and followed over time. This innovative approach could be applied to the evaluation of other active compounds."

In this research, we are interested in one type of imaging objects: small blobs. Examples of small blob objects are cells in histopathology images, glomeruli in MR images, etc. This problem is particularly challenging because the small blobs often have in homogeneous intensity distribution and an indistinct boundary against the background. Yet, in general, these blobs have similar sizes. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel detector termed Hessian-based Laplacian of Gaussian (HLoG) using scale space theory as the foundation. Like most imaging detectors, an image is first smoothed via LoG. Hessian analysis is then launched to identify the single optimal scale on which a presegmentation is conducted. The advantage of the Hessian process is that it is capable of delineating the blobs. As a result, regional features can be retrieved. These features enable an unsupervised clustering algorithm for postpruning which should be more robust and sensitive than the traditional threshold-based postpruning commonly used in most imaging detectors. To test the performance of the proposed HLoG, two sets of 2-D grey medical images are studied. HLoG is compared against three state-of-the-art detectors: generalized LoG, Radial-Symmetry and LoG using precision, recall, and F-score metrics.We observe that HLoG statistically outperforms the compared detectors."

In the field of biomedical imaging, trees have been widely studied as they can be used to describe structures such as neurons, blood vessels and lung airways. It has been shown that the morphological characteristics of these structures can provide information on their function aiding the characterization of pathological states. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that analyze their shape and quantify differences between their structures. In this paper, we present a method for the comparison of tree-like shapes that takes into account both topological and geometrical information. This method, which is based on the Elastic Shape Analysis Framework, also computes the mean shape of a population of trees. As a first application, we have considered the comparison of axon morphology. The performance of our method has been evaluated on two sets of images. For the first set of images, we considered four different populations of neurons from different animals and brain sections from the NeuroMorpho.org open database. The second set was composed of a database of 3D confocal microscopy images of three populations of axonal trees (normal and two types of mutations) of the same type of neurons. We have calculated the inter and intra class distances between the populations and embedded the distance in a classification scheme. We have compared the performance of our method against three other state of the art algorithms, and results showed that the proposed method better distinguishes between the populations. Furthermore, we present the mean shape of each population. These shapes present a more complete picture of the morphological characteristics of each population, compared to the average value of certain predefined features."

However, most of these shape-based methods are computationally expensive. There are instances in an image where no overlapping objects are present and applying these schemes results in significant computational overhead without any accompanying, additional benefit. In this paper we present a novel adaptive active contour scheme (AdACM) that combines boundary and region based energy terms with a shape prior in a multi level set formulation. To reduce the computational overhead, the shape prior term in the variational formulation is only invoked for those instances in the image where overlaps between objects are identified; these overlaps being identified via a contour concavity detection scheme. By not having to invoke all three terms (shape, boundary, region) for segmenting every object in the scene, the computational expense of the integrated active contour model is dramatically reduced, a particularly relevant consideration when multiple objects have to be segmented on very large histopathological images. The AdACM was employed for the task of segmenting nuclei on 80 prostate cancer tissue microarray images from 40 patient studies. Nuclear shape based, architectural and textural features extracted from these segmentations were extracted and found to able to discriminate different Gleason grade patterns with a classification accuracy of 86% via a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier. On average the AdACM model provided 60% savings in computational times compared to a non-optimized hybrid active contour model involving a shape prior."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of entropy-based adaptive nuclear texture features in a total population of 354 uterine sarcomas. Isolated nuclei (monolayers) were prepared from 50 microm tissue sections and stained with Feulgen-Schiff. Local gray level entropy was measured within small windows of each nuclear image and stored in gray level entropy matrices, and two superior adaptive texture features were calculated from each matrix. The 5-year crude survival was significantly higher (P < 0.001) for patients with high texture feature values (72%) than for patients with low feature values (36%). When combining DNA ploidy classification (diploid/nondiploid) and texture (high/low feature value), the patients could be stratified into three risk groups with 5-year crude survival of 77, 57, and 34% (Hazard Ratios (HR) of 1, 2.3, and 4.1, P < 0.001). Entropy-based adaptive nuclear texture was an independent prognostic marker for crude survival in multivariate analysis including relevant clinicopathological features (HR = 2.1, P = 0.001), and should therefore be considered as a potential prognostic marker in uterine sarcomas."

Although the field of digital pathology has had tremendous advances in whole-slide imaging systems, little effort has been directed toward standardizing color brightfield digital imaging to maintain image-to-image consistency and tonal linearity. Using a single camera and microscope to obtain digital images of three stains, we show that microscope and camera systems inherently produce image-to-image variation. Moreover, we demonstrate that post-processing with a widely used raster graphics editor software program does not completely correct for session-to-session inconsistency. We introduce a reliable method for creating consistent images with a hardware/software solution (ChromaCal; Datacolor Inc., NJ) along with its features for creating color standardization, preserving linear tonal levels, providing automated white balancing and setting automated brightness to consistent levels. The resulting image consistency using this method will also streamline mean density and morphometry measurements, as images are easily segmented and single thresholds can be used. We suggest that this is a superior method for color brightfield imaging, which can be used for quantification and can be readily incorporated into workflows."

Epub 2015 Feb 24.,Piccinini F,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2015,2015/03/05,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.02.006,"Today, more and more biological laboratories use 3D cell cultures and tissues grown in vitro as a 3D model of in vivo tumours and metastases. In the last decades, it has been extensively established that multicellular spheroids represent an efficient model to validate effects of drugs and treatments for human care applications. However, a lack of methods for quantitative analysis limits the usage of spheroids as models for routine experiments. Several methods have been proposed in literature to perform high throughput experiments employing spheroids by automatically computing different morphological parameters, such as diameter, volume and sphericity. Nevertheless, these systems are typically grounded on expensive automated technologies, that make the suggested solutions affordable only for a limited subset of laboratories, frequently performing high content screening analysis. In this work we propose AnaSP, an open source software suitable for automatically estimating several morphological parameters of spheroids, by simply analyzing brightfield images acquired with a standard widefield microscope, also not endowed with a motorized stage. The experiments performed proved sensitivity and precision of the segmentation method proposed, and excellent reliability of AnaSP to compute several morphological parameters of spheroids imaged in different conditions. AnaSP is distributed as an open source software tool. Its modular architecture and graphical user interface make it attractive also for researchers who do not work in areas of computer vision and suitable for both high content screenings and occasional spheroid-based experiments."

In this study, the spatial distribution of micro- and mesoscale elastic properties within a human femoral shaft has been investigated. Microscale tissue degree of mineralization (DMB), cortical vascular porosity Ct.Po and the average transverse isotropic stiffness tensor C(Micro) of cylindrical-shaped samples (diameter: 4.4 mm, N = 56) were obtained from cortical regions between 20 and 85% of the total femur length and around the periphery (anterior, medial, posterior and lateral quadrants) by means of synchrotron radiation microCT (SRmicroCT) and 50-MHz scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Within each cylinder, the volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and the mesoscale stiffness tensor C(Meso) were derived using a numerical homogenization approach. Moreover, microelastic maps of the axial elastic coefficient c33 measured by SAM at distinct cross-sectional locations along the femur were used to construct a 3-D multiscale elastic model of the femoral shaft. Variations of vBMD (6.1%) were much lower than the variations of mesoscale elastic coefficients (11.1-21.3%). The variation of DMB was only a minor predictor for variations of the mesoscale elastic properties (0.05 </= R(2) </= 0.34). Instead, variations of the mesoscale elastic properties could be explained by variations of cortical porosity and microscale elastic properties. These data were suitable inputs for numerical evaluations and may help to unravel the relations between structure and composition on the elastic function in cortical bone."

In the study, the purpose was to investigate suitable parameters for quantitative evaluation of EMT morphological changes. A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line was selected for the study. Some cells were stimulated by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) for EMT, and other cells were as control without TGF-beta1 stimulation. Subsequently, cells were placed in phase contrast microscope and three arbitrary fields were captured and saved with a personal computer. Using the tools of Photoshop software, some cells in an image were selected, segmented out and exchanged into unique hue, and other part in the image was shifted into another unique hue. The cells were calculated with 29 morphological parameters by Image Pro Plus software. A parameter between cells with or without TGF-beta1 stimulation was compared statistically and nine parameters were significantly different between them. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) of a parameter was described with SPSS software and F-test was used to compare two areas under the curves (AUCs) in Excel. Among them, roundness and radius ratio were the most AUCs and were significant higher than the other parameters. The results provided a new method with quantitative assessment of cell morphology during EMT, and found out two parameters, roundness and radius ratio, as suitable for quantification."

These procedures are highly time consuming. Here, we present two fully automatic methods to analyze and quantify corneal endothelium imaged by in vivo white light slit-scanning confocal microscopy. METHODS: In the first approach, endothelial cell density is estimated with the help of spatial frequency analysis. We evaluate published methods, and propose a new, parameter-free method. In the second approach, based on the stochastic watershed, cells are automatically segmented and the result is used to estimate cell density, polymegathism (cell size variability) and pleomorphism (cell shape variation). We show how to determine optimal values for the three parameters of this algorithm, and compare its results to a semi-automatic delineation by a trained observer. RESULTS: The frequency analysis method proposed here is more precise than any published method. The segmentation method outperforms the fully automatic method in the NAVIS software (Nidek Technologies Srl, Padova, Italy), which significantly overestimates the number of cells for cell densities below approximately 1200 mm(-2), as well as previously published methods. CONCLUSIONS: The methods presented here provide a significant improvement over the state of the art, and make in vivo, automated assessment of corneal endothelium more accessible. The segmentation method proposed paves the way to many possible new morphometric parameters, which can quickly and precisely be determined from the segmented image."

Epub 2015 Jan 7.,Freer PE,Radiology,2015,2015/01/10,,,10.1148/radiol.14140515,"PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)-guided needle localization for DBT-detected suspicious abnormalities not visualized with other modalities and to analyze the imaging and pathologic characteristics of abnormalities detected only with DBT to determine the positive predictive value for malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. A retrospective query of the imaging database identified 34 consecutive women (average age, 55 years; age range, 28-84 years) with 36 lesions who underwent DBT-guided needle localization between April 2011 and January 2013 with use of commercially available equipment. Imaging findings and medical records were reviewed. Findings that were attributable to previous surgical changes were classified as benign or probably benign and excluded from analysis because the lesions did not proceed to localization. RESULTS: Architectural distortion was the imaging finding identified in all 36 abnormalities (100%). Findings from pathologic examination after the first attempt at localization were concordant with those from imaging in 35 of the 36 lesions (97%), which is suggestive of appropriate sampling. Histologic findings were malignant in 17 of the 36 lesions (47%; 95% confidence interval: 30.4%, 64.5%). Thirteen of the 17 lesions (76%; 95% confidence interval: 50.1%, 93.1%) were invasive malignancies. Twenty-two of the 36 abnormalities (61%) were either malignant or high-risk lesions (atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, atypical lobular hyperplasia). CONCLUSION: DBT-guided needle localization is an accurate and feasible method with which to biopsy DBT-detected suspicious architectural distortions not visualized at mammography or sonography. The high risk of malignancy in abnormalities detected only with DBT (47%) confirms that routine biopsy is required for histologic analysis."

Epub 2015 Jan 6.,Lafazanos S,World Neurosurg,2015,2015/01/11,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2014.12.042,"OBJECTIVE: A challenging step of the paramedian supracerebellar-transtentorial approach is to expose the anterior portion of the mediobasal-temporal region (MTR), a step that seems most affected by the steepness of the tentorium. The objective of this study was to define magnetic resonance imaging measurements that can predict the level of challenge in exposing the anterior portion of the MTR. METHODS: Cranial magnetic resonance imaging studies of 100 healthy individuals were examined. The tentorial and occipital angles were measured, and the amount of brain tissue that remained hidden on the microscopic view in front of the petrous apex was indirectly estimated. These measurements were statistically compared with the cephalic index of each person. RESULTS: The mean values for the tentorial and occipital angles were 42 degrees  (range 25 degrees -53 degrees ) and 98 degrees (range 69 degrees -122 degrees ), respectively. The results proved that the higher the tentorial angle, the higher the occipital angle and the greater the amount of hidden brain tissue. Of 100 persons, 3 (3%) were found to be dolichocephalic, 23 (23%) were mesocephalic, and 74 (74%) were brachycephalic. Statistical analysis proved that individuals with a dolichocephalic cranial shape have lower tentorial and occipital angles. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide strong evidence proving that the lesser the tentorial and occipital angles, the easier the exposure of the anterior portion of the MTR during the paramedian supracerebellar-transtentorial approach. The tendency of the cranial shape toward dolichocephaly seems to have the same practical value in choosing the approach. It is easier to expose the anterior portion of the MTR in these individuals."

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mechanical strength of different diameters of Ti-6Al-4V alloy welded with laser and plasma techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five dumbbell-shaped rods were created from Ti-6Al-4V and divided into 9 groups (n=5): a control group with 3-mm and intact bars; groups PL2.5, PL3, PL4, and PL5 (specimens with 2.5-, 3-, 4-, and 5-mm diameters welded with plasma); and groups L2.5, L3, L4, and L5 (specimens with 2.5-, 3-, 4-, and 5-mm diameters welded with laser). The specimens were tested for ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation percentages (EP) were obtained. Fractured specimens were analyzed by stereomicroscopy, and welded area percentages (WAP) were calculated. Images were made with scanning electron microscopy. In the initial analysis, the data were analyzed with a 2-way ANOVA (2x4) and the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test. In the second analysis, the UTS and EP data were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA, and the Dunnett test was used to compare the 4 experimental groups with the control group (alpha=.05). The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficient tests were applied to correlate the study factors. Finite element models were developed in a workbench environment with boundary conditions simulating those of a tensile test. RESULTS: The 2-way ANOVA showed that the factors welding type and diameter were significant for the UTS and WAP values. However, the interaction between them was not significant. The 1-way ANOVA showed statistically significant differences among the groups for UTS, WAP, and EP values. The Dunnett test showed that all the tested groups had lower UTS and EP values than the control group. The 2.5- and 3-mm diameter groups showed higher values for UTS and WAP than the other test groups. A positive correlation was found between welded area percentage and UTS and a negative correlation between these parameters and the diameters of the specimens. No statistically significant difference was found between the weld techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Under the experimental conditions described, diameters of 2.5 and 3 mm resulted in higher UTS and WAP for both laser and plasma welding and appear to be the best option for joining prefabricated rods in this kind of union."

Assessment of therapeutic responses is complicated by the unpredictable natural history of these tumors. Because diffusion-weighted imaging quantifies microscopic water motion affected by cellular density and histologic features, we hypothesized that it may be helpful in monitoring therapeutic response of LGG to bevacizumab. We retrospectively reviewed eight consecutive patients, median age 4.8 (range 2.3-12.3) years at initiation of bevacizumab therapy for recurrent or refractory LGG. Patients received 10 mg/kg/dose every 2 weeks (median 16 doses/therapy course). Mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured and analyzed in respect to tumor volume. Following the first treatment course, seven of eight patients had reduced tumor volume (>/=25 %) and ADC. The median decrease in tumor volume was 47% (range -6 to 78 %) and the median decrease in ADC was 14 % (range -5 to 30 %). The ADC was significantly decreased during therapy, whereas the decrease in volume was seen only after therapy completion. There was a positive correlation between percent change in tumor volume and ADC (p < 0.05). We report a decrease in tumor ADC during initial bevacizumab therapy that is accompanied by a decrease in volume following therapy. Imaging changes in microscopic water motion associated with histology may be useful in monitoring the therapeutic response of LGG to bevacizumab."

We recently developed an automated classifier that can detect and quantify macrosteatosis with greater than or equal to 95% precision and recall (sensitivity). Here, we report our early results on the classifier's performance in detecting lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning. Automatic quantification of lobular inflammation and ballooning was performed on digital images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of liver biopsy samples from 59 individuals with normal liver histology and varying severity of NAFLD. Two expert hepatopathologists scored liver biopsies according the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical research network scoring system and provided annotations of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning on the digital images. The classifier had precision and recall of 70% and 49% for lobular inflammation, and 91% and 54% for hepatocyte ballooning. In addition, the classifier had an area under the curve of 95% for lobular inflammation and 98% for hepatocyte ballooning. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient for comparison with pathologist grades was 45.2% for lobular inflammation and 46% for hepatocyte ballooning. Our novel observations demonstrate that automatic quantification of cardinal NAFLD histologic lesions is feasible and offer promise for further development of automatic quantification as a potential aid to pathologists evaluating NAFLD biopsies in clinical practice and clinical trials."

Epub 2015 May 1.,Godoy CA,Clinics (Sao Paulo),2015,2015/06/04,PMC4449483,,10.6061/clinics/2015(05)09,"OBJECTIVES: The vulva is the primary site affected in lichen sclerosus, a chronic dermatosis in women that is histologically characterized by a zone of collagen remodeling in the superior dermis. The normal physiological properties of the vulva depend on the assembly of collagen types I (COLI), III (COLIII) and V (COLV), which form heterotypic fibers, and extracellular matrix protein interactions. COLV regulates the heterotypic fiber diameter, and the preservation of its properties is important for maintaining normal tissue architecture and function. In the current work, we analyzed the expression of COLV and its relationship with COLI, COLIII, elastic fibers and extracellular matrix protein 1 in vulvar biopsies from patients with lichen sclerosus. METHODS: Skin biopsies from 21 patients with lichen sclerosus, classified according to Hewitt histological criteria, were studied and compared to clinically normal vulvar tissue (N=21). Morphology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, 3D reconstruction and morphometric analysis of COLI, COLIII, COLV deposition, elastic fibers and extracellular matrix 1 expression in a zone of collagen remodeling in the superior dermis were performed. RESULTS: A significant decrease of elastic fibers and extracellular matrix 1 protein was present in the hyalinization zone of lichen sclerosus compared to healthy controls. The non-homogeneous distribution of collagen fibers visualized under immunofluorescence in the hyalinization zone of lichen sclerosus and control skin was confirmed by histomorphometry. Lichen sclerosus dermis shows a significant increase of COLI, COLIII and COLV expression compared to the healthy controls. Significant inverse associations were found between elastic fibers and COLV and between COLV and extracellular matrix 1 expression. A direct association was found between elastic fiber content and extracellular matrix 1 expression. Tridimensional reconstruction of the heterotypic fibers of the lichen sclerosus zone of collagen remodeling confirmed the presence of densely clustered COLV. CONCLUSIONS: Increased deposition of abnormal COLV and its correlation with extracellular matrix 1 and elastic fibers suggest that COLV may be a trigger in the pathogenesis of lichen sclerosus."

Structured light patterns are projected onto an object through one pathway of a stereoscopic operation microscope. The patterns are deformed by the shape of the object and are then recorded with a high-speed CCD camera placed in the other pathway of the microscope. As the optical pathways of both arms are separated and reach the same object point at a relative angle, the recorded patterns allow the full-field object height variations to be calculated and the three-dimensional shape to be reconstructed by employing standard triangulation techniques. Applying proper hardware triggering, the projector-camera system is synchronized to capture up to 120 unique deformed line patterns per second. Using standard four-step phase-shifting profilometry techniques and applying graphics processing unit programming for fast phase wrapping, scaling, and visualization, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed system to generate 30 microscopic height maps per second. This allows the qualitative depth perception of the stereomicroscope operator to be enhanced by live quantitative height measurements with depth resolutions in the micrometer range."

The extraction of these features has previously not been possible with existing methods. We evaluate the performance of the proposed FS in terms of accuracy and speed in comparison to three existing methods with respect to their limited output. Further, we provide a benchmark dataset of real cell images along with filaments manually marked by a human expert as well as simulated benchmark images. The FS clearly outperforms existing methods in terms of computational runtime and filament extraction accuracy. The implementation of the FS and the benchmark database are available as open source."

We performed a CAI workflow on 1,150 HE images from 230 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. We used a pixel-wise support vector machine classifier for tumor nests (TNs)-stroma segmentation, and a marker-controlled watershed algorithm for nuclei segmentation. 730 morphologic parameters were extracted after segmentation, and 12 parameters identified by Kaplan-Meier analysis were significantly associated with 8-year disease free survival (P < 0.05 for all). Moreover, four image features including TNs feature (HR 1.327, 95%CI [1.001-1.759], P = 0.049), TNs cell nuclei feature (HR 0.729, 95%CI [0.537-0.989], P = 0.042), TNs cell density (HR 1.625, 95%CI [1.177-2.244], P = 0.003), and stromal cell structure feature (HR 1.596, 95%CI [1.142-2.229], P = 0.006) were identified by multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to be new independent prognostic factors. The results indicated that CAI can assist the pathologist in extracting prognostic information from HE histopathology images for IDC. The TNs feature, TNs cell nuclei feature, TNs cell density, and stromal cell structure feature could be new prognostic factors."

Therefore, the correct assignment of cellular phenotypes to cell cycle phases is a crucial task in cell biology research. Nuclear proteins whose localization varies during the cell cycle are valuable and frequently used markers of cell cycle progression. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a protein which is involved in DNA replication and has cell cycle dependent properties. In this work, we present a tool to identify cell cycle phases and in particular, sub-stages of the DNA replication phase (S-phase) based on the characteristic patterns of PCNA distribution. Single time point images of PCNA-immunolabeled cells are acquired using confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopy. In order to discriminate different cell cycle phases, an optimized processing pipeline is proposed. For this purpose, we provide an in-depth analysis and selection of appropriate features for classification, an in-depth evaluation of different classification algorithms, as well as a comparative analysis of classification performance achieved with confocal versus widefield microscopy images. RESULTS: We show that the proposed processing chain is capable of automatically classifying cell cycle phases in PCNA-immunolabeled cells from single time point images, independently of the technique of image acquisition. Comparison of confocal and widefield images showed that for the proposed approach, the overall classification accuracy is slightly higher for confocal microscopy images. CONCLUSION: Overall, automated identification of cell cycle phases and in particular, sub-stages of the DNA replication phase (S-phase) based on the characteristic patterns of PCNA distribution, is feasible for both confocal and widefield images."

Hum Reprod 2009;24(1):45-54. The diagnosis involves detection and counting of stromal and uNK cell nuclei in endometrial biopsy slides immunohistochemically stained with haematoxylin for staining cell nuclei and CD56 as a marker for the uNK cells. However, manual diagnosis is a laborious process, fraught with subjective errors. In this paper, we present a novel method for detection of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in the human female uterus lining and localisation of the luminal epithelium edge in endometrial biopsies. Specifically, we employ a local phase symmetry based method to detect stromal cell nuclei and propose an adaptive background removal method that significantly eases the segmentation of uNK cell nuclei regions. We also propose a novel method using alpha shapes for the identification of epithelial cell nuclei and B-Spline curve fitting on identified cell nuclei to localise the luminal epithelium edge. The objective of edge localisation is to avoid cell nuclei near the luminal epithelium edge being counted in the diagnosis process due to their non-relevance to the calculation of stromal to uNK cell ratio that determines the diagnosis of recurrent miscarriages in the end. The resulting algorithm offers a promising potential for computer-assisted diagnosis of recurrent miscarriage due to its high accuracy."

Histologic measures have classically been used to measure heterogeneity, although a reliable noninvasive measurement is needed both to establish baseline risk of recurrence and monitor response to treatment. Here, we propose using spatiotemporal wavelet kinetic features from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to quantify intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer. METHODS: Tumor pixels are first partitioned into homogeneous subregions using pharmacokinetic measures. Heterogeneity wavelet kinetic (HetWave) features are then extracted from these partitions to obtain spatiotemporal patterns of the wavelet coefficients and the contrast agent uptake. The HetWave features are evaluated in terms of their prognostic value using a logistic regression classifier with genetic algorithm wrapper-based feature selection to classify breast cancer recurrence risk as determined by a validated gene expression assay. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic analysis and area under the curve (AUC) are computed to assess classifier performance using leave-one-out cross validation. The HetWave features outperform other commonly used features (AUC = 0.88 HetWave versus 0.70 standard features). The combination of HetWave and standard features further increases classifier performance (AUCs 0.94). CONCLUSION: The rate of the spatial frequency pattern over the pharmacokinetic partitions can provide valuable prognostic information. SIGNIFICANCE: HetWave could be a powerful feature extraction approach for characterizing tumor heterogeneity, providing valuable prognostic information."

Epub 2015 Jan 28.,Harder N,Cytometry A,2015,2015/01/30,,,10.1002/cyto.a.22632,"Computational approaches for automatic analysis of image-based high-throughput and high-content screens are gaining increased importance to cope with the large amounts of data generated by automated microscopy systems. Typically, automatic image analysis is used to extract phenotypic information once all images of a screen have been acquired. However, also in earlier stages of large-scale experiments image analysis is important, in particular, to support and accelerate the tedious and time-consuming optimization of the experimental conditions and technical settings. We here present a novel approach for automatic, large-scale analysis and experimental optimization with application to a screen on neuroblastoma cell lines. Our approach consists of cell segmentation, tracking, feature extraction, classification, and model-based error correction. The approach can be used for experimental optimization by extracting quantitative information which allows experimentalists to optimally choose and to verify the experimental parameters. This involves systematically studying the global cell movement and proliferation behavior. Moreover, we performed a comprehensive phenotypic analysis of a large-scale neuroblastoma screen including the detection of rare division events such as multi-polar divisions. Major challenges of the analyzed high-throughput data are the relatively low spatio-temporal resolution in conjunction with densely growing cells as well as the high variability of the data. To account for the data variability we optimized feature extraction and classification, and introduced a gray value normalization technique as well as a novel approach for automatic model-based correction of classification errors. In total, we analyzed 4,400 real image sequences, covering observation periods of around 120 h each. We performed an extensive quantitative evaluation, which showed that our approach yields high accuracies of 92.2% for segmentation, 98.2% for tracking, and 86.5% for classification."

We compared dual-energy CT spectral Hounsfield unit attenuation characteristics of nonossified thyroid cartilage with that of squamous cell carcinoma to determine the optimal virtual monochromatic image reconstruction energy levels for distinguishing tumor from normal nonossified thyroid cartilage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dual-energy CT scans from 30 patients with histopathology-proved squamous cell carcinoma at different primary sites (laryngeal and nonlaryngeal) and 10 healthy patients were evaluated. Patients were scanned with a 64-section single-source scanner with fast-kilovolt (peak) switching, and scans were reconstructed at different virtual monochromatic energy levels ranging from 40 to 140 keV. Spectral attenuation curves of tumor and nonossified thyroid cartilage were quantitatively evaluated and compared. Any part of the tumor invading the cartilage, when present, was excluded from ROI analysis to avoid cross-contamination from areas where there could be a mixture of cartilage and invading tumor. RESULTS: Normal nonossified thyroid cartilage had a characteristic, predictable spectral attenuation curve that was different from that of tumors. The greatest difference in attenuation of nonossified cartilage compared with tumor was on virtual monochromatic images of >/=95 keV (P < .0001), with sharp contrast between the relatively high attenuation of nonossified cartilage compared with that of tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has significantly different attenuation on virtual monochromatic images of >/=95 keV, compared with nonossified thyroid cartilage."

Based on this pressing need, we aimed to improve breast cancer prognosis by exploring the prognostic value of tumor histology image analysis. Patient group (n=78) selection was based on invasive breast cancer diagnosis without systemic treatment with a median follow-up of 147 months. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix texture analysis was performed retrospectively on primary tumor tissue section digital images stained either nonspecifically with hematoxylin and eosin or specifically with a pan-cytokeratin antibody cocktail for epithelial malignant cells. Univariate analysis revealed stronger association with metastasis risk by texture analysis when compared with clinicopathological parameters. The combination of individual clinicopathological and texture variables into composite scores resulted in further powerful enhancement of prognostic performance, with an accuracy of up to 90%, discrimination efficiency by the area under the curve [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 0.94 (0.87-0.99) and hazard ratio (95% CI) of 20.1 (7.5-109.4). Internal validation was successfully performed by bootstrap and split-sample cross-validation, suggesting that the models are generalizable. Whereas further validation is needed on an external set of patients, this preliminary study indicates the potential use of primary breast tumor histology texture as a highly accurate, simple, and cost-effective prognostic indicator of distant metastasis risk."

STUDY DESIGN: Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, Inc.) was used for preprocessing the images. First, all images were processed for size uniformity and high distinguishability between the cell and background area. Then, a blank image with the same size and grids was established and cross points of the grids were added into a distinct color. The blank image was merged into a processed image. In the merged images, the cells with 1 or more cross points were chosen, and then the cell areas were enclosed and were replaced in a distinct color. Except for chosen cellular areas, all areas were changed into a unique hue. Three observers quantified roundness of cells in images with the image preprocess (IPP) or without the method (Controls), respectively. Furthermore, 1 observer measured the roundness 3 times with the 2 methods, respectively. The results between IPPs and Controls were compared for repeatability and reproducibility. RESULTS: As compared with the Control method, among 3 observers, use of the IPP method resulted in a higher number and a higher percentage of same-chosen cells in an image. The relative average deviation values of roundness, either for 3 observers or 1 observer, were significantly higher in Controls than in IPPs (p < 0.01 or 0.001). The values of intraclass correlation coefficient, both in Single Type or Average, were higher in IPPs than in Controls both for 3 observers and 1 observer. CONCLUSION: Processed with Adobe Photoshop, a chosen cell from an image was more objective, regular, and accurate, creating an increase of reproducibility and repeatability on morphometry of A549 cells in epithelial to mesenchymal transition."

The present article focuses on how these morphological variations impact synaptic transmission. We based our study on Monte Carlo computational simulations of simplified model synapses whose morphological features have been extracted from hundreds of actual synaptic junctions reconstructed by three-dimensional electron microscopy. We have examined the effects that parameters such as synaptic size or density of AMPA receptors have on the number of receptors that open after release of a single synaptic vesicle. Our results indicate that the maximum number of receptors that will open after the release of a single synaptic vesicle may show a ten-fold variation in the whole population of synapses. When individual synapses are considered, there is also a stochastical variability that is maximal in small synapses with low numbers of receptors. The number of postsynaptic receptors and the size of the synaptic junction are the most influential parameters, while the packing density of receptors or the concentration of extrasynaptic transporters have little or no influence on the opening of AMPA receptors."

METHODS: Thirty eyes of 30 patients who underwent SMILE for the correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism in this study. Morphologic modifications of corneal architecture and the density of corneal subbasal nerve were evaluated prior to SMILE and 7 days, 1, 3, and 6 months after SMILE by in-vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and 3D-OCT. RESULTS: The corneal epithelium morphology showed no particular changes during the entire 6-month examination period. Subbasal nerve density recovered to preoperative levels within 3 months after SMILE (P > 0.05). On the interface layer, intense keratocyte activity was noted in all eyes after SMILE. The corneal fibrotic tissues on the interface layer diminished with time, but the persistence of brightly reflective particles still existed. No particular change between preoperative and postoperative corneal endothelium. The incision margin of SMILE had the appearance of a less clearly identified fibrotic scar with epithelial plug. CONCLUSIONS: IVCM and 3D-OCT analysis showed that there is a low-level corneal wound-healing response after SMILE procedure in the early postoperative period. Subbasal nerve regeneration is recovered at the third month, but the reflective particles elevated up to the sixth month."

While time series microscopy has provided insight into the cell activities within single growing neovessel sprouts, less is known concerning neovascular dynamics within a large angiogenic tissue bed. Here, we developed a time-lapse imaging technique that allowed visualization and quantification of sprouting neovessels as they form and grow away from adult parent microvessels in three dimensions over cubic millimeters of matrix volume during the course of up to 5 days on the microscope. Using a new image acquisition procedure and novel morphometric analysis tools, we quantified the elongation dynamics of growing neovessels and found an episodic growth pattern accompanied by fluctuations in neovessel diameter. Average elongation rate was 5 mum/h for individual vessels, but we also observed considerable dynamic variability in growth character including retraction and complete regression of entire neovessels. We observed neovessel-to-neovessel directed growth over tens to hundreds of microns preceding tip-to-tip inosculation. As we have previously described via static 3D imaging at discrete time points, we identified different collagen fibril structures associated with the growing neovessel tip and stalk, and observed the coordinated alignment of growing neovessels in a deforming matrix. Overall analysis of the entire image volumes demonstrated that although individual neovessels exhibited episodic growth and regression, there was a monotonic increase in parameters associated with the entire vascular bed such as total network length and number of branch points. This new time-lapse imaging approach corroborated morphometric changes in individual neovessels described by us and others, as well as captured dynamic neovessel behaviors unique to days-long angiogenesis within the forming neovascular network."

Most of the approaches proposed in the literature try to segment the crypts using only the biopsy image without understanding the meaning of each pixel. The proposed method differs in that we segment the crypts using an automatically generated pixel-level classification image of the original biopsy image and handle the artifacts due to the sectioning process and variance in color, shape and size of the crypts. The biopsy image pixels are classified to nuclei, immune system, lumen, cytoplasm, stroma and goblet cells. The crypts are then segmented using a novel active contour approach, where the external force is determined by the semantics of each pixel and the model of the crypt. The active contour is applied for every lumen candidate detected using the pixel-level classification. Finally, a false positive crypt elimination process is performed to remove segmentation errors. This is done by measuring their adherence to the crypt model using the pixel level classification results. The method was tested on 54 biopsy images containing 4944 healthy and 2236 cancerous crypts, resulting in 87% detection of the crypts with 9% of false positive segments (segments that do not represent a crypt). The segmentation accuracy of the true positive segments is 96%."

The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between functional thalamic network patterns, derived using seed-based connectivity analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) applied separately to resting state functional MRI (fMRI) data from 21 healthy participants. For the seed-based analysis, functional thalamic parcellation was achieved by computing functional connectivity (FC) between thalamic voxels and a set of pre-defined cortical regions. Thalamus-constrained ICA provided an alternative parcellation. Both FC analyses demonstrated plausible and comparable group-level thalamic subdivisions, in agreement with previous work. Quantitative assessment of the spatial overlap between FC thalamic segmentations, and comparison of each to a histological ""gold-standard"" thalamic atlas and a structurally-defined thalamic atlas, highlighted variations between them and, most notably, differences with both histological and structural results. Whilst deeper understanding of thalamocortical connectivity rests upon identification of features common to multiple non-invasive neuroimaging techniques (e.g. FC, structural connectivity and anatomical localisation of individual-specific nuclei), this work sheds further light on the functional organisation of the thalamus and the varying sensitivities of complementary analyses to resolve it."

We segment images twice to obtain the correct area of interest, and select ten features, including the circle number, concavity point, and other basic features, to filter fungi. An artificial neural network (ANN) system is used to identify the fungi. The first stage (ANN-1) processes features from five images in differing focal lengths; the second stage (ANN-2) identifies the fungi using the ANN-1 output values. Images in differing focal lengths can be used to improve the identification result. The system output accurately detects the image, whether or not it has fungi. If the image does have fungi, the system output counts the number of different fungi types."

Measures of cortical development, including thickness, curvature, and gyrification have been extensively studied in older children, adolescents, and adults, revealing regional associations with cognitive performance, and alterations with disease or pathology. In addition to these gross morphometric measures, increased attention has recently focused on quantifying more specific indices of cortical structure, in particular intracortical myelination, and their relationship to cognitive skills, including IQ, executive functioning, and language performance. Here we analyze the progression of cortical myelination across early childhood, from 1 to 6 years of age, in vivo for the first time. Using two quantitative imaging techniques, namely T1 relaxation time and myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, we characterize myelination throughout the cortex, examine developmental trends, and investigate hemispheric and gender-based differences. We present a pattern of cortical myelination that broadly mirrors established histological timelines, with somatosensory, motor and visual cortices myelinating by 1 year of age; and frontal and temporal cortices exhibiting more protracted myelination. Developmental trajectories, defined by logarithmic functions (increasing for MWF, decreasing for T1), were characterized for each of 68 cortical regions. Comparisons of trajectories between hemispheres and gender revealed no significant differences. Results illustrate the ability to quantitatively map cortical myelination throughout early neurodevelopment, and may provide an important new tool for investigating typical and atypical development."

Moreover, the ability to automate steps in the analysis and interpretation of histological images that currently require manual inspection by pathologists could revolutionize medical diagnostics. Toward this end, we developed a new imaging approach called multidimensional microscopic molecular profiling (MMMP) that can measure several independent molecular properties in situ at subcellular resolution for the same tissue specimen. MMMP involves repeated cycles of antibody or histochemical staining, imaging, and signal removal, which ultimately can generate information analogous to a multidimensional flow cytometry analysis on intact tissue sections. We performed a MMMP analysis on a tissue microarray containing a diverse set of 102 human tissues using a panel of 15 informative antibody and 5 histochemical stains plus DAPI. Large-scale unsupervised analysis of MMMP data, and visualization of the resulting classifications, identified molecular profiles that were associated with functional tissue features. We then directly annotated H&E images from this MMMP series such that canonical histological features of interest (e.g. blood vessels, epithelium, red blood cells) were individually labeled. By integrating image annotation data, we identified molecular signatures that were associated with specific histological annotations and we developed statistical models for automatically classifying these features. The classification accuracy for automated histology labeling was objectively evaluated using a cross-validation strategy, and significant accuracy (with a median per-pixel rate of 77% per feature from 15 annotated samples) for de novo feature prediction was obtained. These results suggest that high-dimensional profiling may advance the development of computer-based systems for automatically parsing relevant histological and cellular features from molecular imaging data of arbitrary human tissue samples, and can provide a framework and resource to spur the optimization of these technologies."

As a consequence, the medical images have the potential to enhance the diagnosis of disease, the prediction of clinical outcomes and the characterization of disease progression. But in the meantime, the growing data dimensions pose great methodological and computational challenges for the representation and selection of features in image cluster analysis. To address these challenges, we first extend the functional principal component analysis (FPCA) from one dimension to two dimensions to fully capture the space variation of image the signals. The image signals contain a large number of redundant features which provide no additional information for clustering analysis. The widely used methods for removing the irrelevant features are sparse clustering algorithms using a lasso-type penalty to select the features. However, the accuracy of clustering using a lasso-type penalty depends on the selection of the penalty parameters and the threshold value. In practice, they are difficult to determine. Recently, randomized algorithms have received a great deal of attentions in big data analysis. This paper presents a randomized algorithm for accurate feature selection in image clustering analysis. The proposed method is applied to both the liver and kidney cancer histology image data from the TCGA database. The results demonstrate that the randomized feature selection method coupled with functional principal component analysis substantially outperforms the current sparse clustering algorithms in image cluster analysis."

Recently, in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) has become an established method for the noninvasive examination of skin tumors. OBJECTIVES: Determination of the value of RCM on the vascularity of nonpigmented skin tumors. METHODS: One hundred and twenty two tumoral lesions have been evaluated by RCM in terms of their vascular structures. They were classified in five groups as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), seborrheic keratosis (SK), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/keratoacanthoma, actinic keratosis (AK)/Bowen disease and others. Vascular morphologies were investigated as curved linear, straight linear, branching, tubular/canalicular, round and polymorphic vessels in six types. LIMITATIONS: Relatively, small number of patients with some tumor subgroups is limitation. Larger prospective studies are required before firm conclusions can be drawn. RESULTS: Excellent compliance was obtained in interobserver analysis. Branching vessels had a high predictive value for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with RCM (P < 0.001). Also vascular polymorphism was more frequently (69.4%) seen in malignant nonpigmented tumors (P < 0.05) than benign nonpigmented tumors (30.6%). Furthermore, vessels with opposite flows had high predictive value for malignant tumors (P < 0.05) compared with benign tumors. CONCLUSION: Vascular properties can be evaluated in the diagnosis of nonpigmented tumoral skin lesions via RCM."

METHODS: Forty-nine patients with 60 histopathologically proven ovarian cystic lesions underwent pelvic MRI including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), liver acquisition with volume acceleration, and ESWAN. Ovarian cystic lesions were divided into endometrial cysts (group 1; n = 28), pyosalpinx and hydrosalpinx (group 2; n = 13), and ovarian cystic and cystic-solid tumors (group 3; n = 19). R2* (effective transverse relaxation rate) values were measured and pairwise comparison of the R2* values among the three groups was made using Kruskal-Wallis test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to calculate cutoff values and performance of R2* values for distinguishing among groups. T1WI signal intensity and R2* value were also compared using area under curve values. RESULTS: R2* values for group 1 were statistically higher than groups 2 and 3 (15.37, 1.40, and 1.79 Hz, respectively; P < 0.001). The cutoff value for R2* was 7.43 Hz with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 96.43, 87.50, 87.10, 96.55, and 91.67%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the R2* value and T1WI in diagnosing endometrial cysts. CONCLUSIONS: The R2* value provides an effective way to discriminate endometrial cysts from other ovarian cystic lesions."

Epub 2015 Feb 26.,Jo JA,Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,2015,2015/02/28,PMC4592321,,10.1093/ehjci/jev018,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to validate novel imaging technology for simultaneous morphological and biochemical endogenous optical imaging of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. METHODS AND RESULTS: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) generates high-resolution 3D images of plaque morphology and endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) characterizes biochemical composition. Both imaging modalities rely on plaque's intrinsic optical characteristics, making contrast agents unnecessary. A multimodal OCT/FLIM system was utilized to generate luminal biochemical maps superimposed on high-resolution (7 microm axial and 13 microm lateral) structural volumetric images. Forty-seven fresh postmortem human coronary segments were imaged: pathological intimal thickening (PIT, n = 26), fibroatheroma (FA, n = 12), thin-cap FA (TCFA, n = 2), and fibrocalcific plaque (CA, n = 7), determined by histopathology. Multimodal images were evaluated, and each plaque identified as PIT, FA, TCFA, or CA based on expert OCT readers, and as having high-lipid (HL), high-collagen (HC), or low-collagen/low-lipid (LCL) luminal composition based on linear discriminant analysis of FLIM. Of 47 plaques, 89.4% (42/47) of the plaques were correctly identified based on OCT/FLIM evaluation using tissue histopathology and immunohistochemistry as the gold standard. Four of the misclassifications corresponded to confusing PIT with HL luminal composition for FA with HL cap. The other corresponded to confusing FA with a HC cap for FA with an LCL cap. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the feasibility of accurate simultaneous OCT/FLIM morphological and biochemical characterization of coronary plaques at spatial resolutions and acquisition speeds compatible with catheter-based intravascular imaging. The success of this pilot study sets up future development of a multimodal intravascular imaging system that will enable studies that could help improve our understanding of plaque pathogenesis."

Clinical and histopathological (blastoid vs. non-blastoid) data were noted from medical records. RESULTS: Extranodal involvement was present in overall 51/78 patients on CT (65%), 18/28 (64%) patients at presentation. Spleen (21/78-27%) and bowel (19/78-24%) were the most common sites of extranodal involvement by MCL on imaging, followed by lungs (10/78-13%) and skin/subcutaneous tissue (9/78-12%). Bowel involvement was either in the form of endophytic polypoidal lesions (n = 11, mean size 3.1 cm), as focal mild bowel wall thickening (n = 5, mean thickness 1.4 cm), or as combination of the two (n = 3). Blastoid histology was present in 14/78 (24%) patients and was statistically associated with skin/subcutaneous involvement (p < 0.05; Fisher's exact t test). Median follow-up was 72 months during which 21 patients died with median survival of 48 months (26 months for blastoid histology vs. 47 months for non-blastoid histology). There was no statistical correlation between sites of involvement and survival. CONCLUSIONS: MCL has a predilection for extranodal disease, predominantly involving the spleen, bowel, lungs, and subcutaneous tissue. GI involvement on CT is in the form of endoluminal polypoidal lesions and mild bowel wall thickening. Skin/subcutaneous involvement was statistically more common with blastoid histology in our study."

The depletion of these neurons is thought to reduce the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway, as well as the neural fibers that link the substantia nigra to the striatum (putamen and caudate), causing a dysregulation in striatal activity that ultimately leads to lack of movement control. Based on diffusion tensor imaging, visualizing this pathway and measuring alterations of the fiber integrity remain challenging. The objectives were to 1) develop a diffusion tensor tractography protocol for reliably tracking the nigrostriatal fibers on multicenter data; 2) test whether the integrities measured by diffusion tensor imaging of the nigrostriatal fibers are abnormal in PD; and 3) test whether abnormal integrities of the nigrostriatal fibers in PD patients are associated with the severity of motor disability and putaminal dopamine binding ratios. METHODS: Diffusion tensor tractography was performed on 50 drug-naive PD patients and 27 healthy control subjects from the international multicenter Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative. RESULTS: Tractography consistently detected the nigrostriatal fibers, yielding reliable diffusion measures. Fractional anisotropy, along with radial and axial diffusivity of the nigrostriatal tract, showed systematic abnormalities in patients. In addition, variations in fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity of the nigrostriatal tract were associated with the degree of motor deficits in PD patients. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the findings imply that the diffusion tensor imaging characteristic of the nigrostriatal tract is potentially an index for detecting and staging of early PD."

Regulatory authorities welcome not only information on the presence of micron-sized particles, but often any information on sub-visible particles in the size range obtained by orthogonal sizing techniques. The present study demonstrates the power of combining established techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) and micro-flow imaging (MFI), with novel analyses such as raster image correlation spectroscopy (RICS) that offer to bridge existent particle sizing gaps in this area. The influence of thermal and freeze-thaw stress treatments on particle size and morphology was assessed for a bi-specific antibody (mAb2). Aggregation of mAb2 was confirmed to be concentration- and treatment-dependent following thermal stress and freeze-thaw cycling. Particle size and count data show concentration- and treatment-dependent behaviour of aggregate counts, morphological descriptors and particle size distributions. Complementarity in particle size output was observed between all approaches utilised, where RICS bridged the analytical size gap ( approximately 0.5-5 mum) between DLS and MFI. Overall, this study highlights the potential of orthogonal image analyses such as RICS (analytical size gap) and MFI (particle morphology) for formulation screening."

Epub 2015 Jun 19.,Garrard JW,Ultraschall Med,2015,2015/06/20,,,10.1055/s-0034-1399676,"PURPOSE: There is a need to develop methods that reliably quantify characteristics associated with vulnerable carotid plaque. Greyscale median (GSM) and shear wave elastography (SWE) are two techniques that may improve individual plaque risk stratification. SWE, which quantifies Young's Modulus (YM) to estimate tissue stiffness, has been researched in the liver, breast, thyroid and prostate, but its use in carotid plaques is novel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to quantify YM and GSM of plaques and compare to histology. 25 patients (64% male) with a mean age of 76 underwent both clinical and SWE imaging. The mean GSM was quantified over a cardiac cycle. The mean YM was quantified in multiple regions within the plaque over 5 frames. Histological features were assessed following carotid endarterectomy. RESULTS: The mean YM of unstable plaques was significantly lower than that of stable plaques (50.0 kPa vs. 79.1 kPa; p = 0.027). The presence of intra-plaque hemorrhage, thrombus and increasing numbers of foam cells was also associated with a significantly lower YM. Plaque YM did not correlate well with plaque GSM (r =  .12). The mean plaque GSM was the same in both unstable and stable plaques. Fibrous plaques had a significantly higher GSM (p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, SWE provides additional information on plaque stiffness which may be of clinical benefit to help identify vulnerable plaque, and warrants further study."

Imaging techniques that help address this challenge could contribute to more complete and accurate tumor excision, and thereby help reduce the current high reexcision rates without resorting to the removal of excess healthy tissue. Optical coherence microelastography (OCME) is a three-dimensional, high-resolution imaging technique that is sensitive to microscale variations of the mechanical properties of tissue. As the tumor modifies the mechanical properties of breast tissue, OCME has the potential to identify, on the microscale, involved regions of fresh, unstained tissue. OCME is based on the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure tissue deformation in response to applied mechanical compression. In this feasibility study on 58 ex vivo samples from patients undergoing mastectomy or wide local excision, we demonstrate the performance of OCME as a means to visualize tissue microarchitecture in benign and malignant human breast tissues. Through a comparison with corresponding histology and OCT images, OCME is shown to enable ready visualization of features such as ducts, lobules, microcysts, blood vessels, and arterioles and to identify invasive tumor through distinctive patterns in OCME images, often with enhanced contrast compared with OCT. These results lay the foundation for future intraoperative studies. Cancer Res; 75(16); 3236-45. (c)2015 AACR."

Twenty healthy volunteers underwent ASQ examinations to evaluate impact factors in ASQ image acquisition and analysis. An additional 113 patients with liver diseases underwent standardized ASQ examinations, and the results were compared with histologic staging of liver fibrosis. We found that the right liver displayed lower values of ASQ parameters than the left (p = 0.000-0.021). Receive gain experienced no significant impact except gain 70 (p = 0.193-1.000). With regard to different diameter of involved vessels in regions of interest, the group </=2.0 mm differed significantly with the group 2.1-5.0 mm (p = 0.000-0.033) and the group >5.0 mm (p = 0.000-0.062). However, the region of interest size (p = 0.438-1.000) and depth (p = 0.072-0.764) had no statistical impact. Good intra- and inter-operator reproducibilities were found in both image acquisitions and offline image analyses. In the liver fibrosis study, the focal disturbance ratio had the highest correlation with histologic fibrosis stage (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the testing position, receive gain and involved vessels were the main factors in ASQ examinations and focal disturbance ratio was the optimal parameter in the assessment of liver fibrosis."

A major challenge in this regard is the distinction between clustered fat droplets and vessels or tissue cracks. METHODS: We present a new method for the identification of fat droplets that utilizes adjacency statistics as shape features. Adjacency statistics are simple statistics on neighbor pixels. RESULTS: The method accurately identified fat droplets with sensitivity and specificity values above 90%. Compared with commonly-used shape features, adjacency statistics greatly improved the sensitivity toward clustered fat droplets by 29% and the specificity by 17%. On a standard personal computer, megapixel images were processed in less than 0.05s. CONCLUSIONS: The presented method is simple to implement and can provide the basis for the fast and accurate quantification of steatosis."

Epub 2015 Jun 28.,Rosenkrantz AB,Clin Radiol,2015,2015/07/02,,,10.1016/j.crad.2015.05.011,"AIM: To evaluate the performance of normalised apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for prostate cancer assessment when performed by independent observers blinded to histopathology findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients undergoing 3 T phased-array coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; maximal b-value 1000 s/mm(2)) before prostatectomy were included. Two radiologists independently evaluated the images, unaware of the histopathology findings. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn within areas showing visually low ADC within the peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) bilaterally. ROIs were also placed within regions in both lobes not suspicious for tumour, allowing computation of normalised ADC (nADC) ratios between suspicious and non-suspicious regions. The diagnostic performance of ADC and nADC were compared. RESULTS: For PZ tumour detection, ADC achieved significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC; p=0.026) and specificity (p=0.021) than nADC for reader 1, and significantly higher AUC (p=0.025) than nADC for reader 2. For TZ tumour detection, nADC achieved significantly higher specificity (p=0.003) and accuracy (p=0.004) than ADC for reader 2. For PZ Gleason score >3+3 tumour detection, ADC achieved significantly higher AUC (p=0.003) and specificity (p=0.005) than nADC for reader 1, and significantly higher AUC (p=0.023) than nADC for reader 2. For TZ Gleason score >3+3 tumour detection, ADC achieved significantly higher specificity (p=0.019) than nADC for reader 1. CONCLUSION: In contrast to prior studies performing unblinded evaluations, ADC was observed to outperform nADC overall for two independent observers blinded to the histopathology findings. Therefore, although strategies to improve the utility of ADC measurements in prostate cancer assessment merit continued investigation, caution is warranted when applying normalisation to improve diagnostic performance in clinical practice."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted involving 103 patients who attended symptomatic breast clinics between March 2012 and September 2012. All had subtle signs on 2D images or ultrasound. Mammographic score distribution was compared between 2D imaging and 2D + 3D imaging, followed by comparison with the gold-standard histopathology. Receiver operative characteristic curves and area under curve (AUC) were calculated for 2D imaging and the combination imaging (2D + 3D). SPSS((R)) v. 21 (IBM Corp., New York, NY; formerly SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for data analysis with p < 0.05 as statistically significant. RESULTS: M3 lesions were reduced from 91 (85.8%) to 18 (16.9%) with the combination imaging. The mean AUC +/- 95% confidence interval for 2D images alone was 0.721 (0.662-0.905) and for combined 2D and 3D images was 0.901 (0.765-1.00). The difference in AUCs between the two modalities was 0.180. CONCLUSION: DBT (3D imaging) increases diagnostic accuracy in a symptomatic breast clinic setting and reduces the number of M3 mammograms, when used as an adjuvant to 2D images. Therefore, DBT has the potential to increase workflow efficiency in a symptomatic setting by reducing benign biopsies. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: DBT reduces the number of M3 mammograms when used in the symptomatic breast setting and has the potential to reduce benign biopsies."

These methods enable us to investigate the morphology and monitor the physiological process in the skin by the use of femtosecond lasers operating in the red, near-infrared spectral range (680-1,300 nm). In this work we used two different techniques that require no labeling: second harmonic generation (SHG) for collagen detection and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) to assess lipid distribution in genetically obese murine skin. Obesity is one of the most serious public health problems due to its high and increasing prevalence and the associated risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Other than these diseases, nearly half of patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from dermatological complications such as delayed wound healing, foot ulcers and several other skin changes. In our experiment we investigated and followed the effects of obesity on dermal collagen alterations and adipocyte enlargement using a technique not reported in the literature so far. Our results indicate that the in vivo SHG and ex vivo CARS imaging technique might be an important tool for diagnosis of diabetes-related skin disorders in the near future."

Our goal was to investigate the relationship between the intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic conditions and wall mechanical properties in human aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 8 unruptured aneurysms were analyzed. Computational fluid dynamics models were constructed from preoperative 3D rotational angiography images. The aneurysms were clipped, and the domes were resected and mechanically tested to failure with a uniaxial testing system under multiphoton microscopy. Linear regression analysis was performed to explore possible correlations between hemodynamic quantities and the failure characteristics and stiffness of the wall. RESULTS: The ultimate strain was correlated negatively to aneurysm inflow rate (P = .021), mean velocity (P = .025), and mean wall shear stress (P = .039). It was also correlated negatively to inflow concentration, oscillatory shear index, and measures of the complexity and instability of the flow; however, these trends did not reach statistical significance. The wall stiffness at high strains was correlated positively to inflow rate (P = .014), mean velocity (P = .008), inflow concentration (P = .04), flow instability (P = .006), flow complexity (P = .019), wall shear stress (P = .002), and oscillatory shear index (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: In a study of 8 unruptured intracranial aneurysms, ultimate strain was correlated negatively with aneurysm inflow rate, mean velocity, and mean wall shear stress. Wall stiffness was correlated positively with aneurysm inflow rate, mean velocity, wall shear stress, flow complexity and stability, and oscillatory shear index.

The structure also controls many of the properties of the food, including consumer acceptance, taste, mouthfeel, appearance, and so on, and nutrition. Imaging provides an important tool for measuring the structure of foods. This includes 2-dimensional (2D) images of surfaces and sections, for example, viewed in a microscope, as well as 3-dimensional (3D) images of internal structure as may be produced by confocal microscopy, or computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The use of images also guides robotics for harvesting and sorting. Processing of images may be needed to calibrate colors, reduce noise, enhance detail, and delineate structure and dimensions. Measurement of structural information such as volume fraction and internal surface areas, as well as the analysis of object size, location, and shape in both 2- and 3-dimensional images is illustrated and described, with primary references and examples from a wide range of applications."

This study investigates the ability of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE), an emerging imaging tool, to image the morphology of neoplastic and non-neoplastic breast tissues, and determines the ability of histopathologists and surgeons to differentiate these images. Freshly excised tumour samples and adjacent non-diseased sections from 50 consenting patients were stained with 0.01 % acriflavine hydrochloride and imaged using pCLE. All discernible pCLE features were cross-examined with conventional histopathology. Following pattern recognition training, 17 histopathologists and surgeons with no pCLE experience interpreted 50 pCLE images independently whilst blinded to histopathology results. Three-hundred and fifty pCLE image mosaics were analysed. Consistent with histopathology findings, the glandular structures, adipocytes and collagen fibres of normal breast were readily visible on pCLE images. These were distinguishable from the morphological architecture exhibited by invasive and non-invasive carcinoma. The mean accuracy of pCLE image interpretation for histopathologists and surgeons was 94 and 92 %, respectively. Overall, inter-observer agreement for histopathologists was 'almost perfect', kappa = 0.82; and 'substantial' for surgeons, kappa = 0.74. pCLE morphological features of neoplastic and non-neoplastic breast tissues are readily visualized and distinguishable with high accuracy by both histopathologists and surgeons. Further research is required to investigate a potential role for the use of pCLE intraoperatively for in situ detection of residual cancerous foci, thereby guiding operating decision-making based on real-time breast cavity scanning."

Cell centers were manually identified on the images at the stratum granulosum (SG) and stratum spinosum (SS) levels. Voronoi diagrams were used to calculate geometrical and topological parameters. Infant cell density is higher than that of adults and decreases with age. Projected cell area, cell perimeter, and average distance to the nearest neighbors increase with age but do so distinctly between the two layers. Structural entropy is different between the two strata, but remains constant with time. For all ages and layers, the distribution of the number of nearest neighbors is typical of a cooperator network architecture. The topological analysis provides evidence of the maturation process in infant skin. The differences between infant and adult are more pronounced in the SG than SS, while cell cooperation is evident in all cases of healthy skin examined."

The key feature is the spectral selection of light in the output arm of an interferometer with use of the specialized imaging acousto-optical tunable filter. In this filter, two interfering optical beams are diffracted via the same ultrasound wave without destruction of interference image structure. The basic requirements for the acousto-optical tunable filter are defined, and mathematical formulas for calculation of its parameters are derived. Theoretical estimation of the achievable accuracy of the 3D image reconstruction is presented and experimental proofs are given. It is demonstrated that spectral imaging can also be accompanied by measurement of the quantitative reflectance spectra. Examples of inspection of optically transparent and nontransparent samples demonstrate the applicability of the technique."

Epub 2015 Nov 18.,Chen Q,Hell J Nucl Med,2015,2015/11/18,,,10.1967/s002449910302,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic value of visual and semi-quantitative analysis of technetium-99m-poly-ethylene glycol, 4-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ((99m)Tc-3PRGD2) scintimammography (SMG) for better differentiation of benign from malignant breast masses, and also investigate the incremental role of semi-quantitative index of SMG. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 72 patients with breast lesions were included in the study. Technetium-99m-3PRGD2 SMG was performed with single photon emission computed tomography (SPET) at 60 min after intravenous injection of 749 +/- 86MBq of the radiotracer. Images were evaluated by visual interpretation and semi-quantitative indices of tumor to non-tumor (T/N) ratios, which were compared with pathology results. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine the optimal visual grade, to calculate cut-off values of semi-quantitative indices, and to compare visual and semi-quantitative diagnostic values. RESULTS: Among the 72 patients, 89 lesions were confirmed by histopathology after fine needle aspiration biopsy or surgery, 48 malignant and 41 benign lesions. The mean T/N ratio of (99m)Tc-3PRGD2 SMG in malignant lesions was significantly higher than that in benign lesions (P<0.05). When grade 2 of the disease was used as cut-off value for the detection of primary breast cancer, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 81.3%, 70.7%, and 76.4%, respectively. When a T/N ratio of 2.01 was used as cut-off value, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 79.2%, 75.6%, and 77.5%, respectively. According to ROC analysis, the area under the curve for semi-quantitative analysis was higher than that for visual analysis, but the statistical difference was not significant (P=0.372). Compared with visual analysis or semi-quantitative analysis alone, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of visual analysis combined with semi-quantitative analysis in diagnosing primary breast cancer were higher, being: 87.5%, 82.9%, and 85.4%, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.891. CONCLUSION: Results of the present study suggest that the semi-quantitative and visual analysis statistically showed similar results. The semi-quantitative analysis provided incremental value additive to visual analysis of (99m)Tc-3PRGD2 SMG for the detection of breast cancer. It seems from our results that, when the tumor was located in the medial part of the breast, the semi-quantitative analysis gave better diagnostic results."

Subsequently, we studied the remineralization process with a paste containing calcium and phosphate ions. Repeated atomic force microscopy imaging of the same sample areas on the sample allowed us to draw detailed conclusions regarding the specific mechanism of the demineralization process and the subsequent remineralization process. The about 1-mum-deep grooves that are caused by the demineralization process were preferentially filled with deposited nanoparticles, leading to smoother enamel and dentine surfaces after 90 min exposure to the remineralizing agent. The deposited material is found to homogeneously cover the enamel and dentine surfaces in the same manner. The temporal evolution of the surface roughness indicates that the remineralization caused by the repair paste proceeds in two distinct successive phases."

To overcome these difficulties, we herein present an approach to describe objects (e.g. cells, bone trabeculae) by a scalar field that can be propagated through registered images of serial histological sections. METHODS: The transformation of objects within images (e.g. cells) to a scalar field was performed by convolution of the object's centroids with differently formed radial basis function (e.g. for direct or indirect spatial interaction). On the basis of such a scalar field, a summation field described distributed objects within an image. RESULTS: After image registration i) colocalization analysis could be performed on basis scalar field, which is propagated through registered images, and - due to the shape of the field - were barely prone to matching errors and morphological changes by different cutting levels; ii) furthermore, depending on the field shape the colocalization measurements could also quantify spatial interaction (e.g. direct or paracrine cellular contact); ii) the field-overlap, which represents the spatial distance, of different objects (e.g. two cells) could be calculated by the histogram intersection. CONCLUSIONS: The description of objects (e.g. cells, cell clusters, bone trabeculae etc.) as a field offers several possibilities: First, co-localization of different markers (e.g. by immunohistochemical staining) in serial sections can be performed in an automatic, objective and quantifiable way. In contrast to multicolour staining (e.g. 10-colour immunofluorescence) the financial and technical requirements are fairly minor. Second, the approach allows searching for different types of spatial interactions (e.g. direct and indirect cellular interaction) between objects by taking field shape into account (e.g. thin vs. broad). Third, by describing spatially distributed groups of objects as summation field, it gives cluster definition that relies rather on the bare object distance than on the modelled spatial cellular interaction."

Here we show a label-free DNA imaging method with stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for visualization of the cell nuclei in live animals and intact fresh human tissues with subcellular resolution. Relying on the distinct Raman spectral features of the carbon-hydrogen bonds in DNA, the distribution of DNA is retrieved from the strong background of proteins and lipids by linear decomposition of SRS images at three optimally selected Raman shifts. Based on changes on DNA condensation in the nucleus, we were able to capture chromosome dynamics during cell division both in vitro and in vivo. We tracked mouse skin cell proliferation, induced by drug treatment, through in vivo counting of the mitotic rate. Furthermore, we demonstrated a label-free histology method for human skin cancer diagnosis that provides comparable results to other conventional tissue staining methods such as H&E. Our approach exhibits higher sensitivity than SRS imaging of DNA in the fingerprint spectral region. Compared with spontaneous Raman imaging of DNA, our approach is three orders of magnitude faster, allowing both chromatin dynamic studies and label-free optical histology in real time."

The aim of this study was to reveal most valuable diagnostic features reflecting inflammation severity in colon and elaborate the evaluation method for computer-aided diagnostics. METHODS: Tissue specimens from 24 BALB/c mice and 15 patients were included in the study. Chronic and acute colon inflammation in mice was induced by oral administration of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) solution, while mice in the control group did not get DSS. Human samples of inflamed colon tissue were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 6). Non-inflamed colon tissue of control subjects (n = 9) was obtained from patients with irritable bowel syndrome or functional obstipation. Analysis of morphological changes in mice and human colon mucosa was performed using 4-mum haematoxylin-eosin (HE) sections. The features reflecting morphological changes in the images of colon mucosa were calculated by convolution of Gabor filter bank and array of pixel values. All features were generalized by calculating mean, histogram skewness and entropy of every image response. Principal component analysis was used to construct optimal representation of morphological changes. RESULTS: First principal component (PC1) was representing the major part of features variation (97 % in mice and 71 % in human specimens) and was selected as a measure of inflammation severity. Validation of new measure was performed by means of custom-made software realizing double blind comparison of differences in PC1 with expert's opinion about inflammation severity presented in two compared pictures. Overall accuracy of 80 % for mice and 67 % for human was reached. CONCLUSION: Principal component analysis of spatial frequency features of histological images may provide continuous scale estimation of inflammation severity of colon tissue."

In recent times, several works have been reported about the utilization of biomolecules in combination with synthetic materials to achieve this process. Accordingly, in this study, the ability of an extract obtained from Aloe vera, a commonly used medicinal plant in influencing the biocompatibility of artificial material, is scrutinized using metallocene polyethylene (mPE). The process of coating dense fibrous Aloe vera extract on the surface of mPE was carried out using microwaves. Then, several physicochemical and blood compatibility characterization experiments were performed to disclose the effects of corresponding surface modification. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum showed characteristic vibrations of several active constituents available in Aloe vera and exhibited peak shifts at far infrared regions due to aloe-based mineral deposition. Meanwhile, the contact angle analysis demonstrated a drastic increase in wettability of coated samples, which confirmed the presence of active components on glazed mPE surface. Moreover, the bio-mimic structure of Aloe vera fibers and the influence of microwaves in enhancing the coating characteristics were also meticulously displayed through scanning electron microscopy micrographs and Hirox 3D images. The existence of nanoscale roughness was interpreted through high-resolution profiles obtained from atomic force microscopy. And the extent of variations in irregularities was delineated by measuring average roughness. Aloe vera-induced enrichment in the hemocompatible properties of mPE was established by carrying out in vitro tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, platelet adhesion, and hemolysis assay. In conclusion, the Aloe vera-glazed mPE substrate was inferred to attain desirable properties required for multifaceted biomedical implants."

Advances in microfluidics have made it possible to study the details of blood flow in the microscale, however, important issues such as the relationship between the local microstructure and local flow characteristics have not been investigated extensively. In the present study an experimental system involving simple brightfield microscopy has been successfully developed for simultaneous, time-resolved quantification of velocity fields and local aggregation of human red blood cells (RBC) in microchannels. RBCs were suspended in Dextran and phosphate buffer saline solutions for the control of aggregation. Local aggregation characteristics were investigated at bulk and local levels using statistical and edge-detection image processing techniques. A special case of aggregating flow in a microchannel, in which hematocrit gradients were present, was studied as a function of flowrate and time. The level of aggregation was found to strongly correlate with local variations in velocity in both the bulk flow and wall regions. The edge detection based analysis showed that near the side wall large aggregates are associated with regions corresponding to high local velocities and low local shear. On the contrary, in the bulk flow region large aggregates occurred in regions of low velocity and high erythrocyte concentration suggesting a combined effect of hematocrit and velocity distributions on local aggregation characteristics. The results of this study showed that using multiple methods for aggregation quantification, albeit empirical, could help towards a robust characterisation of the structural properties of the fluid."

Epub 2015 Mar 16.,Rathore S,Comput Biol Med,2015,2015/03/31,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.03.004,"Automatic classification of colon into normal and malignant classes is complex due to numerous factors including similar colors in different biological constituents of histopathological imagery. Therefore, such techniques, which exploit the textural and geometric properties of constituents of colon tissues, are desired. In this paper, a novel feature extraction strategy that mathematically models the geometric characteristics of constituents of colon tissues is proposed. In this study, we also show that the hybrid feature space encompassing diverse knowledge about the tissues׳ characteristics is quite promising for classification of colon biopsy images. This paper thus presents a hybrid feature space based colon classification (HFS-CC) technique, which utilizes hybrid features for differentiating normal and malignant colon samples. The hybrid feature space is formed to provide the classifier different types of discriminative features such as features having rich information about geometric structure and image texture. Along with the proposed geometric features, a few conventional features such as morphological, texture, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) are also used to develop a hybrid feature set. The SIFT features are reduced using minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy (mRMR). Various kernels of support vector machines (SVM) are employed as classifiers, and their performance is analyzed on 174 colon biopsy images. The proposed geometric features have achieved an accuracy of 92.62%, thereby showing their effectiveness. Moreover, the proposed HFS-CC technique achieves 98.07% testing and 99.18% training accuracy. The better performance of HFS-CC is largely due to the discerning ability of the proposed geometric features and the developed hybrid feature space."

We compared ultrasonography (B-mode), SWE and histologic sizes. With qualitative and quantitative SWE analysis, sensitivity was 94% and specificity 73%. Malignant lesions appeared more heterogeneous, with higher stiffness and ratio values than benign lesions (p < 0.001). For malignant lesions, SWE size was better correlated to histologic size than B-mode size. Using benign SWE signs to selectively downgrade category 4a and 4b lesions, the specificity improved from 13% to 51% without loss in sensitivity (100%) compared to ultrasound."

We evaluated the imaging findings of breast cancer in very young women (<30 years) and to correlate them with clinicopathological features. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 50 surgically confirmed breast cancers were included in our retrospective study. The medical records were reviewed and the radiological features were analyzed according to the new 5th edition of the ACR BI-RADS lexicon. RESULTS: The breast cancers in our study population most commonly presented as a self-detected mass (74%), T2-3 stage (58%), histological grade III (52.3%) and ER-positive (80%) subtype. The most common finding was an irregular (87.5%) hyperdense (66.7%) mass with indistinct margins (50%) on mammography and an irregular (75.6%) indistinct (57.8%) hypoechoic/heterogeneous (77.8%) mass without a posterior acoustic feature (60%) on ultrasonography. MRI revealed an irregular shape (63.3%), irregular margins (43.3%), and heterogeneous enhancement (60%) with washout kinetics (69.4%). Mammographically, microcalcifications were correlated with the HER2-enriched type, and mass-type lesions were correlated with triple-negative cancer (p=0.04). An oval/round mass on ultrasound (p=0.005), rim enhancement (p=0.004) and intralesional T2 high signal intensity (p=0.04) on MRI were associated with the triple-negative type. CONCLUSIONS: On all imaging modalities, breast cancer in very young women usually presented as an irregular mass, and certain radiological features could be used for predicting the specific tumor type."

The double capsule is a complication associated with textured prostheses that leads to implant displacement; however, its etiology has yet to be elucidated. In this study, 10 double capsules were sampled from breast expander implants for in-depth analysis; histologically, the inner capsular layer demonstrated highly organized collagen in sheets with delamination of fibers. At the prosthesis interface (PI) where the implant shell contacts the inner capsular layer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a thin layer which mirrored the three-dimensional characteristics of the implant texture; the external surface of the inner capsular layer facing the intercapsular space (ICS) was flat. SEM examination of the inner capsule layer revealed both a large bacterial presence as well as biofilm deposition at the PI; a significantly lower quantity of bacteria and biofilm were found at the ICS interface. These findings suggest that the double capsule phenomenon's etiopathogenesis is of mechanical origin. Delamination of the periprosthetic capsule leads to the creation of the ICS; the maintained separation of the 2 layers subsequently alters the biostability of the macro-textured breast implant."

We aimed to assess whether structural changes potentially attributable to sudden death pathogenesis were present on magnetic resonance imaging in people who subsequently died of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. In a retrospective, voxel-based analysis of T1 volume scans, we compared grey matter volumes in 12 cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (two definite, 10 probable; eight males), acquired 2 years [median, interquartile range (IQR) 2.8] before death [median (IQR) age at scanning 33.5 (22) years], with 34 people at high risk [age 30.5 (12); 19 males], 19 at low risk [age 30 (7.5); 12 males] of sudden death, and 15 healthy controls [age 37 (16); seven males]. At-risk subjects were defined based on risk factors of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy identified in a recent combined risk factor analysis. We identified increased grey matter volume in the right anterior hippocampus/amygdala and parahippocampus in sudden death cases and people at high risk, when compared to those at low risk and controls. Compared to controls, posterior thalamic grey matter volume, an area mediating oxygen regulation, was reduced in cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and subjects at high risk. The extent of reduction correlated with disease duration in all subjects with epilepsy. Increased amygdalo-hippocampal grey matter volume with right-sided changes is consistent with histo-pathological findings reported in sudden infant death syndrome. We speculate that the right-sided predominance reflects asymmetric central influences on autonomic outflow, contributing to cardiac arrhythmia. Pulvinar damage may impair hypoxia regulation. The imaging findings in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and people at high risk may be useful as a biomarker for risk-stratification in future studies."

The purpose of this study was to determine the value of microscopic tumour histomorphology texture for prognosis of local and systemic recurrence at the time of initial IBC diagnosis. This retrospective study included a group of 52 patients selected on the basis of non-metastatic IBC diagnosis, stage IIIB. Gray-Level-Co-Occurrence-Matrix (GLCM) texture analysis was performed on digital images of primary tumour tissue sections stained with haematoxylin/eosin. Obtained values were categorized by use of both data- and outcome-based methods. All five acquired GLCM texture features significantly associated with metastasis outcome. By accuracies of 69-81% and AUCs of 0.71-0.81, prognostic performance of GLCM parameters exceeded that of standard major IBC clinical prognosticators such as tumour grade and response to induction chemotherapy. Furthermore, a composite score consisting of tumour grade, contrast and correlation as independent features resulted in further enhancement of prognostic performance by accuracy of 89%, discrimination efficiency by AUC of 0.93 and an outstanding hazard ratio of 71.6 (95%CI, 41.7-148.4). Internal validation was successfully performed by bootstrap and split-sample cross-validation, suggesting that the model is generalizable. This study indicates for the first time the potential use of primary breast tumour histology texture as a highly accurate, simple and cost-effective prognostic indicator of metastasis risk in IBC. Clinical relevance of the obtained results rests on the role of prognosis in decisions on induction chemotherapy and the resulting impact on quality of life and survival."

STUDY DESIGN: We employed digital image processing to stratify patients based on the histological attributes of the primary tumor. We extracted image features that capture the nuclear and architectural properties of the specimen. We then used a novel machine learning algorithm to transform image features into a scalar score that provided not only a metastasis prediction but also the certainty of classification. RESULTS: We applied this procedure to 101 patients with a ground truth established by histological examination of the lymph nodes and found that 68.3% of the cohort could be classified, exhibiting a correct prediction rate of 88.4%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a technique that potentially can be used to supplant existing surgical methods to determine ALN metastasis status, thereby reducing patient morbidity associated with over-treatment."

Cell detection and segmentation are essential steps for CAD. These tasks are challenging due to variations in cell shapes, touching cells, and cluttered background. In this paper, we present a cell detection and segmentation algorithm using the sparse reconstruction with trivial templates and a stacked denoising autoencoder (sDAE). The sparse reconstruction handles the shape variations by representing a testing patch as a linear combination of shapes in the learned dictionary. Trivial templates are used to model the touching parts. The sDAE, trained with the original data and their structured labels, is used for cell segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply sparse reconstruction and sDAE with structured labels for cell detection and segmentation. The proposed method is extensively tested on two data sets containing more than 3000 cells obtained from brain tumor and lung cancer images. Our algorithm achieves the best performance compared with other state of the arts."

It has been hypothesized that lung injury depends, in addition to microvascular obstruction, on an increased pulmonary capillary pressure and altered alveolar-capillary membrane permeability, causing pulmonary fluid accumulation. METHODS: This study compared the histopathological features of lung injury in Southeast Asian patients (n = 43) who died from severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and correlated these with clinical history in groups with or without PE. To investigate the expression of mediators that may influence fluid accumulation in PE, immunohistochemistry and image analysis were performed on controls and sub-sets of patient with or without PE. RESULTS: The expression of leukocyte sub-set antigens, bronchial interleukin (IL)-33, gamma-epithelium sodium channel (ENaC), aquaporin (AQP)-1 and -5, and control cytokeratin staining was quantified in the lung tissue of severe malaria patients. Bronchial IL-33 expression was significantly increased in severe malaria patients with PE. Malaria patients with shock showed significantly increased bronchial IL-33 compare to other clinical manifestations. Bronchial IL-33 levels were positively correlated with CD68+ monocyte and elastase + neutrophil, septal congestion and hyaline membrane formation. Moreover, the expression of both vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) and bronchial gamma-ENaC significantly decreased in severe malaria patients with PE. Both VSMC and bronchial gamma-ENaC were negatively correlated with the degree of parasitized erythrocyte sequestration, alveolar thickness, alveolar expansion score, septal congestion score, and malarial pigment score. In contrast AQP-1 and -5 and pan cytokeratin levels were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that IL-33 may play a role in lung injury during severe malaria and lead to PE. Both VSMC and bronchial gamma-ENaC downregulation may explain pulmonary fluid disturbances and participate in PE pathogenesis in severe malaria patients."

However, few algorithms can automatically reconstruct the full structure well without manual assistance, making it essential to develop new methods for this task. METHODS: This paper introduces a new pipeline for reconstructing neuron anatomy structure from 3-D microscopy image stacks. This pipeline is initialized with a set of seeds that were detected by our proposed Sliding Volume Filter (SVF), given a non-circular cross-section of a neuron cell. Then, an improved open curve snake model combined with a SVF external force is applied to trace the full skeleton of the neuron cell. A radius estimation method based on a 2D sliding band filter is developed to fit the real edge of the cross-section of the neuron cell. Finally, a surface reconstruction method based on non-parallel curve networks is used to generate the neuron cell surface to finish this pipeline. RESULTS: The proposed pipeline has been evaluated using publicly available datasets. The results show that the proposed method achieves promising results in some datasets from the DIgital reconstruction of Axonal and DEndritic Morphology (DIADEM) challenge and new BigNeuron project. CONCLUSION: The new pipeline works well in neuron tracing and reconstruction. It can achieve higher efficiency, stability and robustness in neuron skeleton tracing. Furthermore, the proposed radius estimation method and applied surface reconstruction method can obtain more accurate neuron anatomy structures."

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to outline variations in ITSS-morphology and their relationship to location as well as volume of the lesion in patients with glioblastoma (GB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Contrast-enhanced SWI (CE-SWI) images of 40 patients with histologically confirmed GB were analyzed retrospectively with particular attention to ITSS-morphology dividing all lesions into two groups. Considering the location of the lesion within brain parenchyma, lesions with and without involvement of the subventricular zone (SVZ+/SVZ-) were discerned. Additionally, the contrast-enhancing tumor volume was evaluated. Statistical analysis was based on a classification analysis resulting in a classification rule (tree) as well as Mann-Whitney-U test. RESULTS: The distribution of ITSS-scores showed differences between the SVZ+ and SVZ- groups. While SVZ-GB showed only fine-linear or dot-like ITSS, in SVZ+ GB the ITSS-morphology changed with the tumor volume, that is, in larger tumors dense and conglomerated ITSS were the predominant finding. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that ITSS-morphology is not a random phenomenon. Location of GB, as well as tumor volume, appear to be factors contributing to ITSS morphology."

In medical ultrasound imaging, the structures that need to be detected appear as a collection of microstructures correlated along a path. In this paper, we investigated techniques that extract meaningful low-level information for curvilinear structures, using techniques based on structure tensor. We proposed a novel structure tensor enhancement inspired by bilateral filtering. We compared the proposed approach with five state-of-the-art curvilinear structure detectors. We tested the algorithms against simulated images with known ground truth and real images from three different domains (medical ultrasound, scanning electron microscope, and astronomy). For the real images, we employed experts to delineate the ground truth for each domain. Techniques borrowed from machine learning robustly assessed the performance of the methods (area under curve and cross validation). As a practical application, we used the proposed method to label a set of 5000 ultrasound images. We conclude that the proposed tensor-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in providing magnitude and orientation information for curvilinear structures. The evaluation methodology ensures that the employed feature-detection method will yield reproducible performance on new, unseen images. We published all the implemented methods as open-source software."

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,Paul A,IEEE Trans Image Process,2015,2015/07/29,,,10.1109/TIP.2015.2460455,"Histopathological grading of cancer not only offers an insight to the patients' prognosis but also helps in making individual treatment plans. Mitosis counts in histopathological slides play a crucial role for invasive breast cancer grading using the Nottingham grading system. Pathologists perform this grading by manual examinations of a few thousand images for each patient. Hence, finding the mitotic figures from these images is a tedious job and also prone to observer variability due to variations in the appearances of the mitotic cells. We propose a fast and accurate approach for automatic mitosis detection from histopathological images. We employ area morphological scale space for cell segmentation. The scale space is constructed in a novel manner by restricting the scales with the maximization of relative-entropy between the cells and the background. This results in precise cell segmentation. The segmented cells are classified in mitotic and non-mitotic category using the random forest classifier. Experiments show at least 12% improvement in F1 score on more than 450 histopathological images at 40x magnification."

Epub 2015 Sep 10.,Kast R,J Neurooncol,2015,2015/09/12,,,10.1007/s11060-015-1929-4,"In neurosurgical applications, a tool capable of distinguishing grey matter, white matter, and areas of tumor and/or necrosis in near-real time could greatly aid in tumor resection decision making. Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive spectroscopic technique which provides molecular information about the tissue under examination based on the vibrational properties of the constituent molecules. With careful measurement and data processing, a spatial step and repeat acquisition of Raman spectra can be used to create Raman images. Forty frozen brain tissue sections were imaged in their entirety using a 300-microm-square measurement grid, and two or more regions of interest within each tissue were also imaged using a 25 microm-square step size. Molecular correlates for histologic features of interest were identified within the Raman spectra, and novel imaging algorithms were developed to compare molecular features across multiple tissues. In previous work, the relative concentration of individual biomolecules was imaged. Here, the relative concentrations of 1004, 1300:1344, and 1660 cm(-1), which correspond primarily to protein and lipid content, were simultaneously imaged across all tissues. This provided simple interpretation of boundaries between grey matter, white matter, and diseased tissue, and corresponded with findings from adjacent hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. This novel, yet simple, multi-channel imaging technique allows clinically-relevant resolution with straightforward molecular interpretation of Raman images not possible by imaging any single peak. This method can be applied to either surgical or laboratory tools for rapid, non-destructive imaging of grey and white matter."

The traditional approach has been to use increasing concentrations of antibiotics, but microorganisms rapidly develop multiresistance to them. Therefore, we investigated the use of natural substances as an alternative solution. The quantification of the biofilms based on the colonized areas was measured using a Cellavista automatic microscope equipped with image analysis software. Using the Cellavista device brings new possibilities for qualification and quantification of sessile cells. In our study, this feature was documented by exploring the antifungal/anti-biofilm activity of amphotericin B, baicalein, chitosan and usnic acid against yeast biofilm formation. The influence of these substances on the formation and eradication of opportunistic pathogenic yeasts Candida parapsilosis and Candida krusei biofilms was studied in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates. While amphotericin B was not very efficient, the use of baicalein and chitosan, even in minimum inhibitory concentrations, was found to rapidly decrease the colonized areas in the wells. The usnic acid did not display any significant antibiofilm properties even at concentration 300mugml(-1). Our results propose that Cellavista is a promising tool for the study of yeast biofilm formation and the effects of antimicrobial agents."

METHODS: Analysis was carried out in 25 coronary artery specimen obtained from 16 cadavers that were imaged ex-vivo imaging by OFDI and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Of 235 cross-sections obtained for histologic evaluation, 149 were classified as showing calcified plaques, and in this group a comparison between histology versus co-registered images by OFDI and IVUS was performed. RESULTS: Maximum thickness of calcification measured by OFDI was well correlated with histology (rs = 0.70, p < 0.0001) whereas IVUS was not useful for quantitative analysis because of the presence of acoustic shadows occurring behind calcifications. Furthermore qualitative evaluation could be carried out using OFDI, for calcifications with vague or invisible outer borders by OFDI had lipid contents (lipid pool or histologic necrotic core) more frequently as compared to those with a clear outer border (79% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001). We also found that calcified nodules, a well-recognized thrombogenic substrate, demonstrated atypical appearance in OFDI, showing irregular surfaces with high attenuation. CONCLUSION: OFDI demonstrated a greater ability than IVUS to provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of coronary arterial calcification. Precise recognition of calcified plaque morphology by OFDI may serve to determine the treatment strategy of patients having atherosclerotic coronary disease."

This makes quality assessment and algorithm adjustment a substantial challenge, particularly when dealing with hundreds of time-lapse movies collected in a high-throughput manner. RESULTS: We present CellProfiler Tracer, a free and open-source tool that complements the object tracking functionality of the CellProfiler biological image analysis package. Tracer allows multi-parametric morphological data to be visualized on object tracks, providing visualizations that have already been validated within the scientific community for time-lapse experiments, and combining them with simple graph-based measures for highlighting possible tracking artifacts.

However, the structural organization of the major proteins composing the lamina is poorly defined. Using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy and computational image analysis, we characterized the supramolecular structures of lamin A, C, B1, and B2 in mouse embryo fibroblast nuclei. Each isoform forms a distinct fiber meshwork, with comparable physical characteristics with respect to mesh edge length, mesh face area and shape, and edge connectivity to form faces. Some differences were found in face areas among isoforms due to variation in the edge lengths and number of edges per face, suggesting that each meshwork has somewhat unique assembly characteristics. In fibroblasts null for the expression of either lamins A/C or lamin B1, the remaining lamin meshworks are altered compared with the lamin meshworks in wild-type nuclei or nuclei lacking lamin B2. Nuclei lacking LA/C exhibit slightly enlarged meshwork faces and some shape changes, whereas LB1-deficient nuclei exhibit primarily a substantial increase in face area. These studies demonstrate that individual lamin isoforms assemble into complex networks within the nuclear lamina and that A- and B-type lamins have distinct roles in maintaining the organization of the nuclear lamina."

To overcome this limitation, we investigate the diagnostic merits arising from dark-field mammography by means of certain tumour structures enclosed within freshly dissected mastectomy samples. METHODS: We performed grating-based absorption, absolute phase and dark-field mammography of three freshly dissected mastectomy samples containing bi- and multifocal carcinoma using a compact, laboratory Talbot-Lau interferometer. Preoperative in vivo imaging (digital mammography, ultrasound, MRI), postoperative histopathological analysis and ex vivo digital mammograms of all samples were acquired for the diagnostic verification of our results. RESULTS: In the diagnosis of multifocal tumour growth, dark-field mammography seems superior to standard breast imaging modalities, providing a better resolution of small, calcified tumour nodules, demarcation of tumour boundaries with desmoplastic stromal response and spiculated soft-tissue strands extending from an invasive ductal breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of selected cases, we demonstrate that dark-field mammography is capable of outperforming conventional mammographic imaging of tumour features in both calcified and non-calcified tumours. Presuming dose optimization, our results encourage further studies on larger patient cohorts to identify those patients that will benefit the most from this promising additional imaging modality. KEY POINTS: * X-ray dark-field mammography provides significantly improved visualization of tumour features * X-ray dark-field mammography is capable of outperforming conventional mammographic imaging * X-ray dark-field mammography provides imaging sensitivity towards highly dispersed calcium grains."

In histology, each dye component attempts to specifically characterize different microscopic structures. In the case of the hematoxylin-eosin stain, universally used for routine examination, quantitative analysis may often require the inspection of different morphological signatures related mainly to nuclei patterns, but also to stroma distribution. Stain separation is usually a preprocessing operation that is transversal to different applications. This paper presents a novel colour separation method that finds the hematoxylin and eosin clusters by projecting the whole (r,g,b) space to a folded surface connecting the distributions of a series of [(r-b),g] planes that divide the cloud of H&E tones. The proposed method produces density maps closer to those obtained with the colour mixing matrices set by an expert, when comparing with the density maps obtained using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), independent component analysis (ICA) and a state-of-the-art method. The method has outperformed three baseline methods, NMF, Macenko and ICA, in about 8%, 12% and 52% for the eosin component, whereas this was about 4%, 8% and 26% for the hematoxylin component."

Image classification approaches have been developed to identify and classify glandular regions in digital images of prostate tissues; however their success has been limited by difficulties in cellular segmentation and tissue heterogeneity. We hypothesized that utilizing image pixels to generate intensity histograms of hematoxylin (H) and eosin (E) stains deconvoluted from H&E images numerically captures the architectural difference between glands and stroma. In addition, we postulated that joint histograms of local binary patterns and local variance (LBPxVAR) can be used as sensitive textural features to differentiate benign/normal tissue from cancer. Here we utilized a machine learning approach comprising of a support vector machine (SVM) followed by a random forest (RF) classifier to digitally stratify prostate tissue into ST, BN and PCa areas. Two pathologists manually annotated 210 images of low- and high-grade tumors from slides that were selected from 20 radical prostatectomies and digitized at high-resolution. The 210 images were split into the training (n=19) and test (n=191) sets. Local intensity histograms of H and E were used to train a SVM classifier to separate ST from epithelium (BN+PCa). The performance of SVM prediction was evaluated by measuring the accuracy of delineating epithelial areas. The Jaccard J=59.5 +/- 14.6 and Rand Ri=62.0 +/- 7.5 indices reported a significantly better prediction when compared to a reference method (Chen et al., Clinical Proteomics 2013, 10:18) based on the averaged values from the test set. To distinguish BN from PCa we trained a RF classifier with LBPxVAR and local intensity histograms and obtained separate performance values for BN and PCa: JBN=35.2 +/- 24.9, OBN=49.6 +/- 32, JPCa=49.5 +/- 18.5, OPCa=72.7 +/- 14.8 and Ri=60.6 +/- 7.6 in the test set. Our pixel-based classification does not rely on the detection of lumens, which is prone to errors and has limitations in high-grade cancers and has the potential to aid in clinical studies in which the quantification of tumor content is necessary to prognosticate the course of the disease. The image data set with ground truth annotation is available for public use to stimulate further research in this area."

Problems can arise when the deformations introduced by pathologies affect the similarity between the atlas and a patient's image. The aim of this work is to exploit the morphological dissimilarities between atlas databases and pathological images to diagnose the underlying clinical condition, while avoiding the dependence on labelled images. We propose a voxelwise atlas rating approach (VoxAR) relying on multiple atlas databases, each representing a particular condition. Using a local image similarity measure to assess the morphological similarity between the atlas and target images, a rating map displaying for each voxel the condition of the atlases most similar to the target is defined. The final diagnosis is established by assigning the condition of the database the most represented in the rating map. We applied the method to diagnose three different conditions associated with dextro-transposition of the great arteries, a congenital heart disease. The proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods using annotated images, with an accuracy of 97.3% when evaluated on a set of 60 whole heart MR images containing healthy and pathological subjects using cross validation."

To this end, we present a new surgical tool detection dataset and a method for joint tool detection and pose estimation in 2d images. Our two-stage pipeline is data-driven and relaxes strong assumptions made by previous works regarding the geometry, number, and position of tools in the image. The first stage classifies each pixel based on local appearance only, while the second stage evaluates a tool-specific shape template to enforce global shape. Both local appearance and global shape are learned from training data. Our method is validated on a new surgical tool dataset of 2 476 images from neurosurgical microscopes, which is made freely available. It improves over existing datasets in size, diversity and detail of annotation. We show that our method significantly improves over competitive baselines from the computer vision field. We achieve 15% detection miss-rate at 10(-1) false positives per image (for the suction tube) over our surgical tool dataset. Results indicate that performing semantic labelling as an intermediate task is key for high quality detection."

METHODS: Thirty-six patients (PSA 11.6 +/- 7.6 ng/mL, mean +/- standard deviation) with histologically confirmed PCa underwent two repeated 3T MR examinations using surface array coils before prostatectomy. Relaxation along fictitious field, cw T1rho, and T2 relaxation times (TRAFF, T1rhocw, T2) were measured and averaged over regions of interest placed in PCa, normal peripheral zone (PZ), and normal central gland (CG) positioned using whole-mount prostatectomy sections and anatomical T2-weighted images. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to distinguish PCa from PZ/CG and PCa with Gleason score (GS) of 3+3 from GS of 3+4/>/= 3+4. RESULTS: TRAFF and T1rhocw relaxation times were repeatable with coefficients of repeatability as a percentage of median value in the range of 7.8-23.2%. AUC (mean, 95% confidence interval) in the differentiation of PCa with GS of 3+3 from PCa with CS of >/= 3+4 were 0.88 (0.72-0.99), 0.69 (0.46-0.90), and 0.68 (0.45-0.88), for TRAFF, T1rhocw, and T2, respectively. CONCLUSION: In quantitative region of interest based analysis, TRAFF outperformed T1rhocw and T2 in PCa detection and characterization."

Epub 2015 Apr 14.,Arteta C,Med Image Anal,2016,2015/05/19,,,10.1016/j.media.2015.03.002,"In many microscopy applications the images may contain both regions of low and high cell densities corresponding to different tissues or colonies at different stages of growth. This poses a challenge to most previously developed automated cell detection and counting methods, which are designed to handle either the low-density scenario (through cell detection) or the high-density scenario (through density estimation or texture analysis). The objective of this work is to detect all the instances of an object of interest in microscopy images. The instances may be partially overlapping and clustered. To this end we introduce a tree-structured discrete graphical model that is used to select and label a set of non-overlapping regions in the image by a global optimization of a classification score. Each region is labeled with the number of instances it contains - for example regions can be selected that contain two or three object instances, by defining separate classes for tuples of objects in the detection process. We show that this formulation can be learned within the structured output SVM framework and that the inference in such a model can be accomplished using dynamic programming on a tree structured region graph. Furthermore, the learning only requires weak annotations - a dot on each instance. The candidate regions for the selection are obtained as extremal region of a surface computed from the microscopy image, and we show that the performance of the model can be improved by considering a proxy problem for learning the surface that allows better selection of the extremal regions. Furthermore, we consider a number of variations for the loss function used in the structured output learning. The model is applied and evaluated over six quite disparate data sets of images covering: fluorescence microscopy, weak-fluorescence molecular images, phase contrast microscopy and histopathology images, and is shown to exceed the state of the art in performance."

The Nottingham Histologic Score system is highly correlated with the shape and appearance of breast cancer nuclei in histopathological images. However, automated nucleus detection is complicated by 1) the large number of nuclei and the size of high resolution digitized pathology images, and 2) the variability in size, shape, appearance, and texture of the individual nuclei. Recently there has been interest in the application of ""Deep Learning"" strategies for classification and analysis of big image data. Histopathology, given its size and complexity, represents an excellent use case for application of deep learning strategies. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a deep learning strategy, is presented for efficient nuclei detection on high-resolution histopathological images of breast cancer. The SSAE learns high-level features from just pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of nuclei. A sliding window operation is applied to each image in order to represent image patches via high-level features obtained via the auto-encoder, which are then subsequently fed to a classifier which categorizes each image patch as nuclear or non-nuclear. Across a cohort of 500 histopathological images (2200 x 2200) and approximately 3500 manually segmented individual nuclei serving as the groundtruth, SSAE was shown to have an improved F-measure 84.49% and an average area under Precision-Recall curve (AveP) 78.83%. The SSAE approach also out-performed nine other state of the art nuclear detection strategies."

In particular, super-resolution microscopy has proven valuable for research studies in protein aggregation. In this chapter we present details of recent advances in this method and the specific techniques, enabling the study of amyloid beta aggregation optically, both in vitro and in cells. First, we show that variants of optical super-resolution microscopy provide a capability to visualize oligomeric and fibrillar structures directly, providing detailed information on species morphology in vitro and even in situ, in the cellular environment. We focus on direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy, dSTORM, which provides morphological detail on spatial scales below 20 nm, and provide detailed protocols for its implementation in the context of amyloid beta research. Secondly, we present a range of optical techniques that offer super-resolution indirectly, which we call multi-parametric microscopy. The latter offers molecular scale information on self-assembly reactions via changes in protein or fluorophore spectral signatures. These techniques are empowered by our recent discovery that disease related amyloid proteins adopt intrinsic energy states upon fibrilisation. We show that fluorescence lifetime imaging provides a particularly sensitive readout to report on the aggregation state, which is robustly quantifiable for experiments performed either in vitro or in vivo."

Biopsy materials from 42 patients, with verified laryngeal cancer and follow-up, were selected from the archives of the University Hospital of Patras, Greece. Twenty six patients had survived more than 5 years and 16 less than 5 years after the first diagnosis. Histopathology images were IHC stained for p63 expression. Images were first processed by a segmentation method for isolating the p63-expressed nuclei. Seventy-seven features were evaluated regarding texture, shape, and physical topology of nuclei, p63 staining, and patient-specific data. Those features, the probabilistic neural network classifier, the leave-one-out (LOO), and the bootstrap cross-validation methods, were used to design the MIA-system for assessing the 5-year survival of patients with laryngeal cancer. MIA-system accuracy was about 90 % and 85 %, employing the LOO and the Bootstrap methods, respectively. The image texture of p63-expressed nuclei appeared coarser and contained more edges in the 5-year non-survivor group. These differences were at a statistically significant level (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study has proposed an MIA-system that may be of assistance to physicians, as a second opinion tool in assessing the 5-year survival of patients with laryngeal cancer, and it has revealed useful information regarding differences in nuclei texture between 5-year survivors and non-survivors."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the difference between chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus and Jessner's lymphocytic infiltration of the skin in an objective and quantitative manner. METHODS: Clinical photographs were examined for erythema quantification using two erythema parameters (a* and erythema dose), and histological images were assessed by computer-aided image analysis. RESULTS: The difference between normal and erythematous skin was more prominent using erythema dose than a*, but no significant differences among the three diseases were observed. The correlation between inflammatory dermal cell infiltration and epidermal thickness, as well as that between erythema parameters and histopathological features, was not significant. CONCLUSION: This is the first attempt to use computer-aided image analysis for the differentiation of similar skin diseases. However, the differentiation between these diseases using quantitative computer-aided image analysis was still not possible."

Here, we describe a novel method of semi-automated digital image analysis in FTLD subtypes including: Pick's disease (PiD, n=11) with tau-positive intracellular inclusions and neuropil threads, and TDP-43 pathology type C (FTLD-TDPC, n=10), defined by TDP-43-positive aggregates predominantly in large dystrophic neurites. To do this, we examined three FTLD-associated cortical regions: mid-frontal gyrus (MFG), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) by immunohistochemistry. We used a color deconvolution process to isolate signal from the chromogen and applied both object detection and intensity thresholding algorithms to quantify pathological burden. We found object-detection algorithms had good agreement with gold-standard manual quantification of tau- and TDP-43-positive inclusions. Our sampling method was reliable across three separate investigators and we obtained similar results in a pilot analysis using open-source software. Regional comparisons using these algorithms finds differences in regional anatomic disease burden between PiD and FTLD-TDP not detected using traditional ordinal scale data, suggesting digital image analysis is a powerful tool for clinicopathological studies in morphologically diverse FTLD syndromes."

METHODS: A total of 158 women referred for adnexal masses were evaluated before surgery by the 4 RMI variants. Physicians with varied experience in ultrasound assessment of adnexal masses performed ultrasound examinations. We compared the performance of the 4 RMI variants using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses followed by calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios using the pathologic diagnosis of the masses as the reference standard. RESULTS: Among the 158 women with adnexal masses included in this study, 51 (32%) had malignant tumors; 26 (51%) of them were stage I. All RMI variants performed similarly (accuracy range, 74%-83%), regardless of menopausal status. Considering all women included, the positive likelihood ratios of the 4 RMI variants ranged from 3.52 to 4.41. In subset analyses, all RMI variants had decreased sensitivity for stage I malignant tumors and for those of nonepithelial histologic types. CONCLUSIONS: The 4 RMI variants performed acceptably in a medium-resource setting where ultrasound examiners were physicians with varied experience. This finding indicates a good tradeoff between performance and feasibility, since ultrasound RMI protocols are of low complexity."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the change in imaging practice on epilepsy surgery outcome in a tertiary pediatric epilepsy surgery center. METHODS: The change in practice occurred in early 2008, and patients were classified based on old or new practice. The patient characteristics, surgical variables, and seizure-free surgical outcome were compared, and the trend in seizure-free outcome over time was assessed. RESULTS: There was a trend for increased abnormal MRI (92% vs. 86%, respectively, p = 0.062), and increased utilization of FDG-PET (34% vs. 3% respectively, p < 0.001) with new relative to old practice. There were no statistically significant differences in invasive monitoring, location, and type of surgery and histology between the two periods (all p > 0.05). During the old practice, there was no statistically significant change in yearly trend of seizure-free outcome (odds ratio [OR] 0.960, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.875-1.053, p = 0.386). The change in practice in 2008 was associated with a significant improvement in seizure-free outcome (OR 1.535, 95% CI 1.100-2.142, p = 0.012). During the new practice, there was a significant positive trend in yearly seizure-free outcome (OR 1.219, 95% CI 1.053-1.411, p = 0.008), after adjusting for age at seizure onset, invasive monitoring, location and type of surgery, histology, MRI, magnetoencephalography, and FDG-PET. SIGNIFICANCE: We have found an improvement in seizure-free surgical outcome following the change in imaging practice. This study highlights the importance of optimizing and improving presurgical diagnostic imaging evaluation to improve surgical outcome."

METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects (nine males, age range, 25-40 years) were included in this study. Morphologic and diffusion data were acquired by means of a 3T MRI scanner. Using an advanced tractographic technique, based on probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution algorithm, postprocessing analyses were performed. Statistical analysis was carried out using the 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. Outcome measure was the percentage distribution of optic radiations streamlines in different cortical visual areas (V1-V5). The latter were detected by means of Juelich probabilistic histologic atlas. RESULTS: Average connectivity analyses revealed that the optic radiations are mainly distributed in V1 (47.46% +/- 5.5) and V2 (32.45% +/- 3.98); furthermore, direct connections with V3 (7.81 +/- 3.06), V4 (4.22% +/- 1.82), and V5 (8.06% +/- 2.65) were also detected. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the connectivity profile of optic radiations, obtained by means of algorithms not affected by the limitations of other tractographic techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, was shown in healthy human brains. Interestingly, direct connections with V4 were detected for the first time in humans; moreover, further support on the possible existence of V5 connections was provided. Our findings showed new connections between lateral geniculate nuclei and cortical visual areas, giving a further possible comprehension of the phenomena leading to the visual signals elaboration."

For liver pathological images of Hematein Eosin staining, the image of R and B channels can reflect the sensitivity of liver pathological images better, while the entropy space and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) space can reflect the texture features of the image better. To obtain the more comprehensive information, we map liver pathological images to the entropy space, LBP space, R space, and B space. The traditional Higher Order Local Autocorrelation Coefficients (HLAC) cannot reflect the overall information of the image, so we propose an average correction HLAC feature. We calculate the statistical properties and the average gray value of pathological images and then update the current pixel value as the absolute value of the difference between the current pixel gray value and the average gray value, which can be more sensitive to the gray value changes of pathological images. Lastly the HLAC template is used to calculate the features of the updated image. The experiment results show that the improved features of the multispatial mapping have the better classification performance for the liver cancer."

Many times, the pollen is overlapping on the microscopic images, which increases the difficulty for its automated identification and classification. This paper focuses on a method to segment the overlapping pollen. First, the proposed method segments the overlapping pollen. Second, the method separates the pollen based on the mean shift process (100% segmentation) and erosion by H-minima based on the Fibonacci series. Thus, pollen is characterized by its shape, color, and texture for training and evaluating the performance of three classification techniques: random tree forest, multilayer perceptron, and Bayes net. Using the newly developed system, we obtained segmentation results of 100% and classification on top of 96.2% and 96.1% in recall and precision using multilayer perceptron in twofold cross validation."

In this perspective, a semantic cognitive virtual microscopy approach has been recently initiated, the MICO project, by focusing on cognitive digital pathology. This approach supports the elaboration of pathology-compliant daily protocols dedicated to breast cancer grading, in particular mitotic counts and nuclear atypia. A proof of concept has thus been elaborated, and an extension of these approaches is now underway in a collaborative digital pathology framework, the FlexMIm project. As important milestones on the way to routine digital pathology, a series of pioneer international benchmarking initiatives have been launched for mitosis detection (MITOS), nuclear atypia grading (MITOS-ATYPIA) and glandular structure detection (GlaS), some of the fundamental grading components in diagnosis and prognosis. These initiatives allow envisaging a consolidated validation referential database for digital pathology in the very near future. This reference database will need coordinated efforts from all major teams working in this area worldwide, and it will certainly represent a critical bottleneck for the acceptance of all future imaging modules in clinical practice. In line with recent advances in molecular imaging and genetics, keeping the microscopic modality at the core of future digital systems in pathology is fundamental to insure the acceptance of these new technologies, as well as for a deeper systemic, structured comprehension of the pathologies. After all, at the scale of routine whole-slide imaging (WSI;  approximately 0.22 microm/pixel), the microscopic image represents a structured 'genomic cluster', enabling a naturally structured support for integrative digital pathology approaches. In order to accelerate and structure the integration of this heterogeneous information, a major effort is and will continue to be devoted to morphological microsemiology (microscopic morphology semantics). Besides insuring the traceability of the results (second opinion) and supporting the orchestration of high-content image analysis modules, the role of semantics will be crucial for the correlation between digital pathology and noninvasive medical imaging modalities. In addition, semantics has an important role in modelling the links between traditional microscopy and recent label-free technologies. The massive amount of visual data is challenging and represents a characteristic intrinsic to digital pathology. The design of an operational integrative microscopy framework needs to focus on scalable multiscale imaging formalism. In this sense, we prospectively consider some of the most recent scalable methodologies adapted to digital pathology as marked point processes for nuclear atypia and point-set mathematical morphology for architecture grading. To orchestrate this scalable framework, semantics-based WSI management (analysis, exploration, indexing, retrieval and report generation support) represents an important means towards approaches to integrating big data into biomedicine. This insight reflects our vision through an instantiation of essential bricks of this type of architecture. The generic approach introduced here is applicable to a number of challenges related to molecular imaging, high-content image management and, more generally, bioinformatics."

Normalized cross-correlation is applied to recorded time-lapse image sequences to determine average displacements within predefined regions of the nucleus and the cytoskeleton. These regional displacements, together with calculations of nuclear elongation, nuclear centroid translocation, and nuclear shape changes, enable quantitative assessments of nucleo-cytoskeletal coupling in both normal and disease conditions and provide an improved understanding of the role of specific nuclear envelope proteins in intracellular force propagation."

METHODS: 51 patients with parotid tumours were examined with DTI on 3.0-T MRI and ARFI imaging on an ultrasound scanner before surgery. Values of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and shear-wave velocity (SWV) were calculated and analyzed with independent samples Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Cut-off values, sensitivity and specificity were calculated with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The value of combination was calculated through parallel test for the cut-off value of ADC, FA and SWV (combination = 0 or 1); then, ROC analysis was performed with pathological results as the gold standard to calculate the sensitivity and specificity for the combination of the three parameters distinguishing benign and malignant parotid tumours. Pathological diagnosis for every patient was made post-operatively from the tumour tissue taken during operation. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between benign and malignant tumours in the values of ADC, FA and SWV (p = 0.032, p = 0.011 and p < 0.0001); a significant difference in the values was also found between pleomorphic adenoma and malignant tumour (p = 0.0012, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002). The diagnosis cut-off points between benign and malignant tumours for ADC, FA and SWV were 1.02 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1), 0.24 and 2.76 m s(-1), respectively; the sensitivity for ADC, FA and SWV was 87.50, 62.50 and 68.75%; the specificity was 45.71, 82.86 and 97.14%. Analysis of the combination of the three parameters increased the sensitivity, specificity, Youden index and area under the ROC curve compared with analysis of each parameter alone for distinguishing benign and malignant tumours. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of the combination of the three parameters for distinguishing benign and malignant parotid tumours is the best; SWV is the preferred indicator. Parameters of DTI and ARFI may reflect the histological characteristics of parotid tumours and predict benignancy and malignancy and could provide quantitative information about the tumour. Combination of DTI with ARFI imaging had obvious advantage for the diagnosis of parotid tumours than each alone."

This is particularly driven by the emerging interest in bringing Big-Data analysis into this arena, encompassing pathology, drug discovery, rare cancer cell detection, emulsion microdroplet assays, to name a few. This momentum is particularly evident in recent advancements in flow cytometry. They include scaling of the number of measurable colors from the labeled cells and incorporation of imaging capability to access the morphological information of the cells. However, an unspoken predicament appears in the current technologies: higher content comes at the expense of lower throughput, and vice versa. For example, accessing additional spatial information of individual cells, imaging flow cytometers only achieve an imaging throughput ~1000 cells/s, orders of magnitude slower than the non-imaging flow cytometers. In this chapter, we introduce an entirely new imaging platform, namely optical time-stretch microscopy, for ultrahigh speed and high contrast label-free single-cell (in a ultrafast microfluidic flow up to 10 m/s) imaging and analysis with an ultra-fast imaging line-scan rate as high as tens of MHz. Based on this technique, not only morphological information of the individual cells can be obtained in an ultrafast manner, quantitative evaluation of cellular information (e.g., cell volume, mass, refractive index, stiffness, membrane tension) at nanometer scale based on the optical phase is also possible. The technology can also be integrated with conventional fluorescence measurements widely adopted in the non-imaging flow cytometers. Therefore, these two combinatorial and complementary measurement capabilities in long run is an attractive platform for addressing the pressing need for expanding the ""parameter space"" in high-throughput single-cell analysis. This chapter provides the general guidelines of constructing the optical system for time stretch imaging, fabrication and design of the microfluidic chip for ultrafast fluidic flow, as well as the image acquisition and processing."

Thin sections were studied using the polarized transmitted light microscopy and under a stereomicroscope, operating in transmitted light and reflected light. There were performed serial images of magnitude 40x. Each image was covered by a grid aimed for microscopic sections volumetric measurements. Therefore, all the serial images were merged and resulted a global image of the entire section surface. Thus, we have analyzed a total of three sections of the same tooth. Based on these sets of images, there were made estimations of the areas affected by colorations, determinations that can be extrapolated to total tooth areas, in terms of volumetric color change of dentin. The proportion of low coloristic infiltrated dentin was very close to the deeply impregnated dentin and the overall impregnated dentin covered half of the total dentin analyzed area."

To improve the efficiency of feature selection, the same feature values of positive and negative samples are removed in rough selection. To obtain the optimal feature subset, a new heuristic search algorithm, which is called Maximum Minimum Backward Selection (MMBS), is proposed in precise selection. MMBS search strategy has the following advantages. (1) For the deficiency of Discernibility of Feature Subsets (DFS) evaluation criteria, which makes the class of small samples invalid for unbalanced samples, the Weighted Discernibility of Feature Subsets (WDFS) evaluation criteria are proposed as the evaluation strategy of MMBS, which is also available for unbalanced samples. (2) For the deficiency of Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) and Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), which can only add or only delete feature, MMBS decides whether to add the feature to feature subset according to WDFS criteria for each feature firstly; then it decides whether to remove the feature from feature subset according to SBS algorithm. In this way, the better feature subset can be obtained. The experiment results show that the proposed hybrid feature selection algorithm has good classification performance for liver tissue pathological image."

It may determine local inflammation, hard tissue resorption, destruction of other periapical tissues. The preliminary diagnosis of chronic periapical lesions is based on the clinical symptoms and imagistic investigation, which represent a reliable diagnosis instrument, but the histological investigation remains essential for a certain diagnosis. We performed a clinical and histological study of the periapical lesions, evaluating the various clinical and imagistic aspects and we compared them with the results of the histological examination, in order to establish the correspondence between the clinical-imagistic aspects and the morphological ones. The relation between the histological aspects, the clinical signs and imagistic aspects may provide valuable data both for establishing an accurate diagnosis and for adopting the most efficient treatment."

On the contrary, fluorophores with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics are strongly fluorescent in their aggregate states and have been an ideal platform for developing highly fluorescent nanomaterials, such as fluorescent silica nanoparticles (FSNPs). In this work, AIE luminogens based on salicylaldehyde hydrazones were embedded in silica nanoparticles through a facile noncovalent approach, which afforded AIE-FSNPs emitting much brighter fluorescence than that of some commercial fluorescein-doped silica and polystyrene nanoparticles. These AIE-FSNPs displaying multiple fluorescence colors were fabricated by a general method, and they underwent much less fluorescence variation due to environmental pH changes compared with fluorescein-hybridized FSNPs. In addition, a DNA aptamer specific to nucleolin was functionalized on the surface of AIE-FSNPs for targeted cell imaging. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry studies both revealed highly selective fluorescence staining of MCF-7 (a cancer cell line with nucleolin overexpression) over MCF-10A (normal) cells by the aptamer-functionalized AIE-FSNPs. The fluorescence imaging in different color channels was achieved using AIE-FSNPs containing each of the AIE luminogens, as well as photoactivatable fluorescent imaging of target cells by the caged AIE fluorophore."

The synthesis involves the encapsulation of luminescent Mn:ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with chitosan not only as a stabilizer in biological environment, but also to further provide active binding sites for the conjugation of other biomolecules. Folic acid was incorporated as targeting agent for the specific targeting of the nanocarrier toward the cells overexpressing folate receptors. Thus, the formed composite emits orange-red fluorescence around 600 nm and investigated to the highest intensity at Mn(2+) doping concentration of 15 at.% and relatively more stable at low acidic and low alkaline pH levels. The structural characteristics and optical properties were thoroughly analyzed by using Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, ultraviolet-visible, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Further characterization was conducted using thermogravimetric analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The cell viability and proliferation studies by means of MTT assay have demonstrated that the as-synthesized composites do not exhibit any toxicity toward the human breast cell line MCF-10 (noncancer) and the breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) up to a 500 microg/mL concentration. The cellular uptake of the nanocomposites was assayed by confocal laser scanning microscope by taking advantage of the conjugated Mn:ZnS QDs as fluorescence makers. The result showed that the functionalization of the chitosan-encapsulated QDs with folic acid enhanced the internalization and binding affinity of the nanocarrier toward folate receptor-overexpressed cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that due to the nontoxic nature of the composite, the as-synthesized nanoparticulate system can be used as a promising candidate for theranostic applications, especially for a simultaneous targeted drug delivery and cellular imaging."

However, conventional invasive cell quality assessment is incompatible with direct evaluation of the cells produced for such therapies, especially in the case of regenerative medicine products. Our group has demonstrated the potential of quantitative assessment of cell quality, using information obtained from cell images, for non-invasive real-time evaluation of regenerative medicine products. However, image of cells in the confluent state are often difficult to evaluate, because accurate recognition of cells is technically difficult and the morphological features of confluent cells are non-characteristic. To overcome these challenges, we developed a new image-processing algorithm, heterogeneity of orientation (H-Orient) processing, to describe the heterogeneous density of cells in the confluent state. In this algorithm, we introduced a Hessian calculation that converts pixel intensity data to orientation data and a statistical profiling calculation that evaluates the heterogeneity of orientations within an image, generating novel parameters that yield a quantitative profile of an image. Using such parameters, we tested the algorithm's performance in discriminating different qualities of cellular images with three types of clinically important cell quality check (QC) models: remaining lifespan check (QC1), manipulation error check (QC2), and differentiation potential check (QC3). Our results show that our orientation analysis algorithm could predict with high accuracy the outcomes of all types of cellular quality checks (>84% average accuracy with cross-validation)."

Until today, there is no suitable objective prediction method. Conventional imaging modalities cannot assess the IA's vessel wall. We investigated the ability of intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a new tool for the characterization and evaluation of IAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experimental setup for acquisition of geometrical aneurysm parameters was developed. Object of basic investigation was a silicone phantom with six IAs from patient data. For structural information, three circle of Willis were dissected and imaged postmortem. All image data were postprocessed by medical imaging software. RESULTS: Geometrical image data of a phantom with six different IAs were acquired. The geometrical image data showed a signal loss, e.g., in aneurysms with a high bottleneck ratio. Imaging data of vessel specimens were evaluated with respect to structural information that is valuable for the characterization of IAs. Those included thin structures (intimal flaps), changes of the vessel wall morphology (intimal thickening, layers), adjacent vessels, small vessel outlets, arterial branches and histological information. CONCLUSION: Intravascular OCT provides new possibilities for diagnosis and rupture assessment of IAs. However, currently used imaging system parameters have to be adapted and new catheter techniques have to be developed for a complete assessment of the morphology of IAs."

Automated nucleus segmentation is a prerequisite for various quantitative analyses including automatic morphological feature computation. However, it remains to be a challenging problem due to the complex nature of histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for robust and automatic nucleus segmentation with shape preservation. Given a nucleus image, it begins with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate a probability map, on which an iterative region merging approach is performed for shape initializations. Next, a novel segmentation algorithm is exploited to separate individual nuclei combining a robust selection-based sparse shape model and a local repulsive deformable model. One of the significant benefits of the proposed framework is that it is applicable to different staining histopathology images. Due to the feature learning characteristic of the deep CNN and the high level shape prior modeling, the proposed method is general enough to perform well across multiple scenarios. We have tested the proposed algorithm on three large-scale pathology image datasets using a range of different tissue and stain preparations, and the comparative experiments with recent state of the arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach."

Shear wave velocity was analyzed using VTIQ in 100 patients with 100 histologically proven cervical lymph nodes. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and leave-one-out cross-validation. Agreement between measurements was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients. The mean shear wave velocity was significantly higher in metastatic lymphadenopathy (4.46 +/- 1.46 m/s) than in benign lymphadenopathy (2.71 +/- 0.85 m/s) (p < 0.001) at a cutoff level of 3.34 m/s. The cross-validated accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 77%, 78.9% and 74.4%, respectively. Agreement of measurements with VTIQ was excellent (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.961). VTIQ shear wave elastography may be a feasible quantitative imaging method for differentiating benign and malignant cervical lymph nodes."

Histology has suggested that hindbrain subdivisions grow differentially, especially in the third trimester. Prematurity-related brain injuries occurring in this period may selectively affect more rapidly developing areas of hindbrain, thus accompanying region-specific impairments in growth and ultimately neurodevelopmental deficits. The current study aimed to quantify regional growth of the cerebellum and the brainstem in preterm neonates (n = 65 with individually multiple scans). We probed associations of the regional volumes with severity of brain injury. In neonates with no imaging evidence of injury, our analysis using a mixed-effect linear model showed faster growth in the pons and the lateral convexity of anterior/posterior cerebellar lobes. Different patterns of growth impairment were found in relation to early cerebral intraventricular hemorrhage and cerebellar hemorrhage (P < 0.05), likely explaining different mechanisms through which neurogenesis is disrupted. The pattern of cerebellar growth identified in our study agreed excellently with details of cerebellar morphogenesis in perinatal development, which has only been observed in histological data. Our proposed analytic framework may provide predictive imaging biomarkers for neurodevelopmental outcome, enabling early identification and treatment of high-risk patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The custom-formulated contrast dye namely red iodized oil (RIO) was prepared by solubilizing a lipophilic dye Oil Red O in iodized poppy seed oil (Lipiodol or LPD) followed by physicochemical characterizations. To explore and test the utility of RIO, normal rats (n = 10) and rabbits (n = 10) with myocardial infarction (MI) were euthanized by overdose of pentobarbital for infusion of RIO through catheterization. The bodies and/or excised organs including heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, and intestines of the rats and rabbits were imaged at clinical mammography, CT and MRI units. These images were qualitatively studied and quantitatively analyzed using Wilcoxon Rank test with a P value < 0.05 being considered of a statistically significant difference. Imaging findings were verified by histomorphology. RESULTS: All experimental procedures were carried out successfully with the use of RIO. T1 and T2 relaxation time was 234.2 +/- 2.6 ms and 141.9 +/- 3.0 ms for RIO, close to that of native LPD. Proton ((1) H) NMR spectroscopy revealed almost identical profiles between RIO and native LPD. The clinical mammography unit, 128-slice CT scanner and 3.0T MRI magnet were well adapted for the animal experiments. Combined use of RIO with DR, MRI, CT and histology enabled microangiography of the organs, 3D visualization of rat pancreas, validation of in vivo cardiac quantification of MI and cause determination of the rabbit death after coronary occlusion. RIO appeared as red droplets and vacuoles in vessels by frozen and paraffin sections. Image analysis showed the superiority of DR images, which provided better overall image quality (4.35 +/- 0.49) for all analyzed liver vessel segments. MRI images revealed moderate to good overall image quality ratings (3.45 +/- 0.52). Comparing the signal intensities of vessel and liver with different MRI sequences, all P values were <0.01. CONCLUSIONS: RIO proved to be a multifunctional contrast dye, which could be applied as an imaging biomarker for tissue vascularity or blood perfusion, for visualization of organ anatomy and for ex vivo validation of in vivo animal experiments."

METHODS: Twenty polished enamel samples were prepared and subjected to a citric acid erosion and pooled human saliva remineralization model. Enamel surface microhardness was measured using a Knoop hardness tester, which confirmed that an early enamel erosion lesion was formed which was then subsequently completely remineralized. A confocal laser scanning microscope was used to capture high-resolution images of the enamel surfaces undergoing demineralization and remineralization. Area-scale analysis was used to identify the optimal feature size following which the surface texture was determined using the 3D (areal) texture parameter Sa. RESULTS: The Sa successfully characterized the enamel erosion and remineralization for the polished enamel samples (P<0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: Areal surface texture characterization of the surface events occurring during enamel demineralization and remineralization requires optical imaging instrumentation with lateral resolution <2.5 mum, applied in combination with appropriate filtering in order to remove unwanted waviness and roughness. These techniques will facilitate the development of novel methods for measuring early enamel erosion lesions in natural enamel surfaces in vivo."

Nevertheless, quantification of biological specimens via any optical measures most often reveals ambiguous information about the specific structural properties within the studied samples. Thus, optical quantification remains nonintuitive to users from the diverse fields of technique application. In this work, we demonstrate that the SM signal can be analyzed to reconstruct explicit physical measures of internal structure within label-free, weakly scattering samples: characteristic length scale and the amplitude of spatial refractive-index (RI) fluctuations. We present and validate the reconstruction algorithm via finite-difference time-domain solutions of Maxwell's equations on an example of exponential spatial correlation of RI. We apply the validated algorithm to experimentally measure structural properties within isolated cells from two genetic variants of HT29 colon cancer cell line as well as within a prostate tissue biopsy section. The presented methodology can lead to the development of novel biophotonics techniques that create two-dimensional maps of explicit structural properties within biomaterials: the characteristic size of macromolecular complexes and the variance of local mass density."

Three types of pathological tissues (PT) are considered: benign hyperplasia, intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the proposed approach, the region of interest containing PT is first extracted from multispectral images using active contour segmentation. This region is then encoded using texture features based on the Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) filter, discrete wavelets (DW) and gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM). To assess the significance of textural differences between PT types, a statistical analysis based on the Kruskal-Wallis test is performed. The usefulness of texture features is then evaluated quantitatively in terms of their ability to predict PT types using various classifier models. RESULTS: Preliminary results show significant texture differences between PT types, for all texture features (p-value < 0.01). Individually, GLCM texture features outperform LoG and DW features in terms of PT type prediction. However, a higher performance can be achieved by combining all texture features, resulting in a mean classification accuracy of 98.92%, sensitivity of 98.12%, and specificity of 99.67%. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of combining multiple texture features for characterizing the continuum of CRC and discriminating between pathological tissues in multispectral images."

Current deconvolution algorithms estimate fluorophore density by using representations of the signal that promote sparsity of the super-resolution images via an L1-norm penalty. This penalty imposes a restriction on the sum of absolute values of the estimates of emitter brightness. By implementing an L0-norm penalty--on the number of fluorophores rather than on their overall brightness--we present a penalized regression approach that can work at high-density and allows fast super-resolution imaging. We validated our approach on simulated images with densities up to 15 emitters per mum(-2) and investigated total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) data of mitochondria in a HEK293-T cell labeled with DAKAP-Dronpa. We demonstrated super-resolution imaging of the dynamics with a resolution down to 55 nm and a 0.5 s time sampling."

Essentially, our Discriminative Feature-oriented Dictionary Learning (DFDL) method learns class-specific dictionaries such that under a sparsity constraint, the learned dictionaries allow representing a new image sample parsimoniously via the dictionary corresponding to the class identity of the sample. At the same time, the dictionary is designed to be poorly capable of representing samples from other classes. Experiments on three challenging real-world image databases: 1) histopathological images of intraductal breast lesions, 2) mammalian kidney, lung and spleen images provided by the Animal Diagnostics Lab (ADL) at Pennsylvania State University, and 3) brain tumor images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, reveal the merits of our proposal over state-of-the-art alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate that DFDL exhibits a more graceful decay in classification accuracy against the number of training images which is highly desirable in practice where generous training is often not available."

A post-mortem histological study,"van Amsterdam WA, Blankestijn PJ, Goldschmeding R, Bleys RL.",Ann Anat. 2016 Mar;204:71-9. doi: 10.1016/j.aanat.2015.11.004. Epub 2015 Nov 23.,van Amsterdam WA,Ann Anat,2016,2015/12/01,,,10.1016/j.aanat.2015.11.004,"BACKGROUND: Renal Denervation as a possible treatment for hypertension has been studied extensively, but knowledge on the distribution of nerves surrounding the renal artery is still incomplete. While sympathetic and sensory nerves have been demonstrated, there is no mention of the presence of parasympathetic nerve fibers. OBJECTIVES: To provide a description of the distribution patterns of the renal nerves in man, and, in addition, provide a detailed representation of the relative contribution of the sympathetic, parasympathetic and afferent divisions of the autonomic nervous system. METHODS: Renal arteries of human cadavers were each divided into four longitudinal segments and immunohistochemically stained with specific markers for afferent, parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Nerve fibers were semi-automatically quantified by computerized image analysis, and expressed as cross-sectional area relative to the distance to the lumen. RESULTS: A total of 3372 nerve segments were identified in 8 arteries of 7 cadavers. Sympathetic, parasympathetic and afferent nerves contributed for 73.5% (95% CI: 65.4-81.5%), 17.9% (10.7-25.1%) and 8.7% (5.0-12.3%) of the total cross-sectional nerve area, respectively. Nerves are closer to the lumen in more distal segments and larger bundles that presumably innervate the kidney lie at 1-3.5mm distance from the lumen. The tissue-penetration depth of the ablation required to destroy 50% of the nerve fibers is 2.37 mm in the proximal segment and 1.78 mm in the most distal segments. CONCLUSION: Sympathetic, parasympathetic and afferent nerves exist in the vicinity of the renal artery. The results warrant further investigation of the role of the parasympathetic nervous system on renal physiology, and may contribute to refinement of the procedure by focusing the ablation on the most distal segment."

AIMS: To determine the histo-morphometric measurement of fibrotic tissue and to explore the possible association between indirect markers (APRI, FORNS, FIB-4, and Lok) and morphometry. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical data from patients with PBC, on whom needle liver biopsy was performed as part of the diagnostic assessment. One section of each biopsy stained with Sirius red was used for calculating the percentage of collagen. Quantitative measure of fibrotic tissue (fibrosis morphometry) was calculated as a percentage of collagen content by digital image analysis. Morphometry results were divided into four groups reflecting Ludwig's staging and compared with values for indirect serum markers. RESULTS: 50 PBC patients were enrolled (86% females, mean age 57 +/- 12.30 years), 19 were Ludwig's stage I (38%), 14 stage II (28%), 12 stage III (24%), and five stage IV (10%). Morphometry results were significantly different among Ludwig stages (p<0.05). No significant differences were found for indirect serum markers. A significant correlation was found between morphometry results and indirect serum markers tested (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In our cohort, the histo-morphometric values of fibrotic tissue increased progressively with Ludwig's stages of PBC, while non-invasive markers did not."

The most effective parameters and their combinations were extracted from Mueller matrix elements, principal component scores and polarization parameters respectively to classify samples into three categories - i.e. cancer, dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia/normal glands for various regions of interest sizes. It was observed that two-step classification yielded higher classification accuracy than the traditional one-step classification and that pixel classification based on Mueller matrix elements yielded higher accuracy than that based on polarization parameters and derived principal components. Moreover, Mueller matrix images with a lower spatial resolution generated higher classification accuracy but those with a higher spatial resolution revealed more morphological details.ns.

Epub 2015 May 13.,Kaden E,Magn Reson Med,2016,2015/05/15,PMC4975722,,10.1002/mrm.25734,"PURPOSE: This article presents a simple method for estimating the effective diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the axons unconfounded by the intravoxel fiber orientation distribution. We also call these parameters the per-axon or microscopic diffusion coefficients. THEORY AND METHODS: Diffusion MR imaging is used to probe the underlying tissue material. The key observation is that for a fixed b-value the spherical mean of the diffusion signal over the gradient directions does not depend on the axon orientation distribution. By exploiting this invariance property, we propose a simple, fast, and robust estimator of the per-axon diffusion coefficients, which we refer to as the spherical mean technique. RESULTS: We demonstrate quantitative maps of the axon-scale diffusion process, which has factored out the effects due to fiber dispersion and crossing, in human brain white matter. These microscopic diffusion coefficients are estimated in vivo using a widely available off-the-shelf pulse sequence featuring multiple b-shells and high-angular gradient resolution. CONCLUSION: The estimation of the per-axon diffusion coefficients is essential for the accurate recovery of the fiber orientation distribution. In addition, the spherical mean technique enables us to discriminate microscopic tissue features from fiber dispersion, which potentially improves the sensitivity and/or specificity to various neurological conditions.

PURPOSE: To assess the ability of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) compared with the ADC ratio (ADCr) to differentially diagnose benign compared with malignant breast lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight women with breast lesions (average age, 45 years) underwent MRI scanning including T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) scanning and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The average ADC and ADCr values for both lesions and pectoralis major muscles (ADCrmuscle and ADCrmuscle) were measured in patients with malignant (n = 25) and benign (n = 23) breast lesions. The ADCr of the contralateral breast (ADCr contralateral) was also evaluated. All histology was confirmed by pathological analysis of biopsied tissue. ADC and ADCr values were analyzed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: For benign lesions compared with malignant lesions, lesion-side ADC was 1.45 vs. 1.05, respectively (P < 0.001), normal-side ADC was 1.82 vs.1.64 (P = 0.002), ADCrmuscle was 1.35 vs. 0.9 (P < 0.001), and ADCrcontralateral was 0.79 vs. 0.64 (P = 0.001). ADCrmuscle showed higher sensitivity (82.61%) and specificity (96.00%) than ADCrcontralateral (60.87% and 92.00%, respectively) and ADC (69.57% and 96.00%) for discriminating malignant from benign lesions. The AUC using ADCrmuscle had higher discriminatory power (0.92, P < 0.001) for malignant versus benign breast lesions compared with either ADC (0.82, P < 0.001) or ADCrcontralateral (0.78, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ADCrmuscle value showed higher sensitivity and specificity and improved diagnostic accuracy compared with either ADC or ADCrcontralateral in differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions."

METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-six DE-CESMs were reviewed from 2012-2013, 59 cases fulfilled the following criteria and were enrolled for analysis: (1) suspicious malignant microcalcifications (BI-RADS 4) on mammogram, (2) no related mass, (3) with pathological diagnoses. The microcalcification morphology and associated enhancement were reviewed to analyse the accuracy of the diagnosis and cancer size measurements versus the results of pathology. RESULTS: Of the 59 microcalcifications, 22 were diagnosed as cancers, 19 were atypical lesions and 18 were benign lesions. Twenty (76.9 %) cancers, three (11.55 %) atypia and three (11.55 %) benign lesions revealed enhancement. The true-positive rate of intermediate- and high-concern microcalcifications was significantly higher than that of low-concern lesions (93.75 % vs. 50 %). Overall, the diagnostic sensitivity of enhancement was 90.9 %, with 83.78 % specificity, 76.92 % positive predictive value, 93.94 % negative predictive value and 86.4 % accuracy. Performance was good (AUC = 0.87) according to a ROC curve and cancer size correlation with a mean difference of 0.05 cm on a Bland-Altman plot. CONCLUSIONS: DE-CESM provides additional enhancement information for diagnosing breast microcalcifications and measuring cancer sizes with high correlation to surgicohistology. KEY POINTS: * DE-CESM provides additional enhancement information for diagnosing suspicious breast microcalcifications. * The enhanced cancer size closely correlates to microscopy by Bland-Altman plot. * DE-CESM could be considered for evaluation of suspicious malignant microcalcifications."

When the studies in the literature are examined, it is seen that the mammography and histopathology images of the same patient are not used together for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Mammographic and microscopic images can be limited when using only one of them for the early detection of the breast cancer. Therefore, multi-modality solutions that give more accuracy results than single solutions have been realized in this paper. 3 x 50 microscopic (histopathology) and 3 x 50 mammography image sets have been taken from Firat University Medicine Faculty Pathology and Radiology Laboratories, respectively. Optimum feature space has been obtained by minimum redundancy and maximum relevance via mutual information method applying to the 3 x 50 microscopic and mammography images. Then, probabilistic values of suspicious lesions in the image for selected features have been found by exponential curve fitting. Jensen Shannon, Hellinger, and Triangle measurements have been used for the diagnosis of breast cancer. It has been proved that these measures have been related to each other. Weight values for selected each feature have been found using these measures. These weight values have been used in object function. Afterward, histopathology and mammography images have been classified as normal, malign, and benign utilizing object function. In the result of this classifier, the accuracy of diagnosis of breast cancer has been estimated probabilistically. Furthermore, classifications have been probabilistically visualized on a pie chart. Consequently, the performances of Jensen Shannon, Hellinger, and Triangle measures have been compared with ROC analysis using histopathology and mammography test images. It has been observed that Jensen Shannon measure has higher performance than Hellinger and Triangle measures. Accuracy rates of histopathology and mammography images in Jensen Shannon measure have been found to 99 and 98%, respectively."

Epub 2016 Jan 9.,Chen X,Br J Dermatol,2016,2015/11/18,,,10.1111/bjd.14292,"BACKGROUND: Eccrine sweat secretion is of central importance for control of body temperature. Although the incidence of sweat gland dysfunction might appear of minor importance, it can be a real concern for people with either hypohidrosis or hyperhidrosis. However, sweat gland function remains relatively poorly explored. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the function of single human sweat glands. METHODS: We describe a new approach for noninvasive imaging of single sweat gland activity in human palms in vivo up to a depth of 100 mum, based on nonlinear two-photon excited autofluorescence (TPEF) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). RESULTS: These techniques appear to be useful compared with approaches already described for imaging single sweat gland activity, as they allow better three-dimensional spatial resolution of sweat pore inner morphology and real-time monitoring of individual sweat events. By filling the sweat pore with oil and tuning the CARS contrast at 2845 cm(-1) , we imaged the ejection of sweat droplets from a single sweat gland when oil is pushed out by sweat flow. On average, sweat events lasted for about 30 s every 3 min under the conditions studied. On the other hand, about 20% of sweat glands were found inactive. TPEF and CARS were also used to study, at the single pore level, the antiperspirant action of aluminium chlorohydrate (ACH) and to reveal, for the first time in vivo, the formation of a plug at the pore entrance, in agreement with reported ACH antiperspirant mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Although data were acquired on human palms, these techniques show great promise for a better understanding of sweat secretion physiology and should be helpful to improve the efficacy of antiperspirant formulations."

METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from the anterior [point Ba; POP Questionnaire (POP-Q)] and/or posterior (point Bp; POP-Q) vaginal wall of 15 women who underwent vaginal surgery for POP. Both histological and biomechanical assessments were performed from the same tissue samples in 14 of 15 patients. For histological assessment, the density of collagen and elastin fibers was determined by combining high-resolution virtual imaging and computer-assisted digital image analysis. For biomechanical testing, uniaxial tension tests were performed to evaluate vaginal tissue stiffness at low (C0) and high (C1) deformation rates. RESULTS: Biomechanical testing highlights the hyperelastic behavior of the vaginal wall. At low strains (C0), vaginal tissue appeared stiffer when elastin density was low. We found a statistically significant inverse relationship between C0 and the elastin/collagen ratio (p = 0.048) in the lamina propria. However, at large strain levels (C1), no clear relationship was observed between elastin density or elastin/collagen ratio and stiffness, likely reflecting the large dispersion of the mechanical behavior of the tissue samples. CONCLUSION: Histological and biomechanical properties of the vaginal wall vary from patient to patient. This study suggests that elastin density deserves consideration as a relevant factor of vaginal stiffness in women with POP."

Despite the wealth of information on IDM for personal ornamentation and ritualistic purposes, evidence of IDM for therapeutic reasons among early Native Americans is poorly known and limited to a handful of cases. We report two upper canines from two pre-Hispanic individuals dated to the Late Horizon Period from Cusco (Peru), each showing a conical perforation on its incisal surface. Analyses were performed using traditional radiography, computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. The depth and symmetrical location of the perforations at the center of the crown suggest that these two teeth were artificially drilled, rather than affected by taphonomic factors. The poor oral health of the individuals, the location of the perforations on the incisal surface, and evidence of intentional manipulation of the pulp chambers (as supported by their overall morphology and presence of striations and deep marks along the walls of the perforations) provide a strong case for the occurrence of prehistoric dentistry in the New World. The two canine teeth reported here represent the first pre-Columbian examples of IDM likely performed to ameliorate a dental pathology (presumably associated with the infection of the dental pulp) found in Peru and in the rest of South America."

Neurons are tree-like structures whose description depends critically on the junctions and terminations, collectively called critical points, making the correct localization and identification of these points a crucial task in the reconstruction process. Here we present a fully automatic method for the integrated detection and characterization of both types of critical points in fluorescence microscopy images of neurons. In view of the majority of our current studies, which are based on cultured neurons, we describe and evaluate the method for application to two-dimensional (2D) images. The method relies on directional filtering and angular profile analysis to extract essential features about the main streamlines at any location in an image, and employs fuzzy logic with carefully designed rules to reason about the feature values in order to make well-informed decisions about the presence of a critical point and its type. Experiments on simulated as well as real images of neurons demonstrate the detection performance of our method. A comparison with the output of two existing neuron reconstruction methods reveals that our method achieves substantially higher detection rates and could provide beneficial information to the reconstruction process."

Feature-based segmentation is especially suitable for biomedical microscopy applications where objects often vary in number, but have limited variation in size.

BLZ-100 is a chlorotoxin-based, tumor-targeting agent that has not yet been studied in HNSCC. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate BLZ-100 uptake in models of HNSCC and oral dysplasia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational study (including sensitivity and specificity analysis) of BLZ-100 uptake in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of HNSCC and a carcinogen-induced dysplasia model of hamster cheek pouches. INTERVENTIONS: Various HNSCC xenografts were established in the tongues of NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice. BLZ-100 was intravenously injected and fluorescence uptake was measured. To induce dysplasia, the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) was applied to the cheek pouch of Golden Syrian hamsters for 9 to16 weeks. BLZ-100 was subcutaneously injected, and fluorescence uptake was measured. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of BLZ-100 was measured in tumor xenografts. To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of BLZ-100 uptake, a digital grid was placed over tissue sections and correlative histologic sections to discretely measure fluorescence intensity and presence of tumor; a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was then plotted. In the hamster dysplasia model, cheeks were graded according to dysplasia severity. The SBR of BLZ-100 was compared among dysplasia grades. RESULTS: In HNSCC xenografts, BLZ-100 demonstrated a mean (SD) SBR of 2.51 (0.47). The ROC curve demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89; an SBR of 2.50 corresponded to 92% sensitivity and 74% specificity. When this analysis was focused on the tumor and nontumor interface, the AUC increased to 0.97; an SBR of 2.50 corresponded to 95% sensitivity and 91% specificity. DMBA treatment of hamster cheek pouches generated lesions representing all grades of dysplasia. The SBR of high-grade dysplasia was significantly greater than that of mild-to-moderate dysplasia (2.31 [0.71] vs 1.51 [0.34], P = .006). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: BLZ-100 is a sensitive and specific marker of HNSCC and can distinguish high-risk from low-risk dysplasia. BLZ-100 has the potential to serve as an intraoperative guide for tumor margin excision and identification of premalignant lesions."

The first step of these systems is cell nucleus segmentation, which has a great impact on the success of the overall system. The marker-controlled watershed is a technique commonly used by the previous studies for nucleus segmentation. These studies define their markers finding regional minima on the intensity/gradient and/or distance transform maps. They typically use the h-minima transform beforehand to suppress noise on these maps. The selection of the h value is critical; unnecessarily small values do not sufficiently suppress the noise, resulting in false and oversegmented markers, and unnecessarily large ones suppress too many pixels, causing missing and undersegmented markers. Because cell nuclei show different characteristics within an image, the same h value may not work to define correct markers for all the nuclei. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a new watershed algorithm that iteratively identifies its markers, considering a set of different h values. In each iteration, the proposed algorithm defines a set of candidates using a particular h value and selects the markers from those candidates provided that they fulfill the size requirement. Working with widefield fluorescence microscopy images, our experiments reveal that the use of multiple h values in our iterative algorithm leads to better segmentation results, compared to its counterparts.

Epub 2016 Mar 11.,Nassar L,J Ultrasound Med,2016,2016/03/13,,,10.7863/ultra.15.05020,"OBJECTIVES: Hyperechogenicity has been strongly associated with benign breast lesions. Although it is correct in most cases, hyperechogenicity must not always be considered synonymous with benignancy, as hyperechoic breast cancers do occur. The purpose of this study was to review clinical and imaging characteristics of hyperechoic breast lesions, looking for features associated with malignancy. METHODS: Institutional Review Board approval was granted for this research. A total of 19,417 sonographic examinations were performed between January 2009 and June 2013. Among these, hyperechoic lesions with histologic diagnoses, stability on long-term followup, or characteristic imaging appearances were included in the study. The patients' clinical charts, mammograms, and sonograms were reviewed. The clinical and imaging features were recorded, and the data was analyzed by the chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and independent-samples t test, looking for statistically significant predictors of malignancy. RESULTS: Among the 19,417 scans, 42 patients (0.2%) with 44 hyperechoic lesions were identified. Twenty-six lesions fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the study: 5 malignancies (3 invasive ductal carcinomas, 1 invasive lobular carcinoma, and 1 invasive mucinous cancer) and 21 benign lesions. An irregular shape, a nonparallel orientation, and noncircumscribed margins were significantly associated with the risk of malignancy (P = .002, .02, and .01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A hyperechoic breast lesion must not always be assumed to be benign. Instead, a full sonographic assessment according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System descriptors is needed for correct characterization and avoidance of misdiagnosis."

Epub 2016 Jan 27.,Kim JW,Neuroimage,2016,2016/01/31,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.01.048,"The habenula consists of a pair of small epithalamic nuclei located adjacent to the dorsomedial thalamus. Despite increasing interest in imaging the habenula due to its critical role in mediating subcortical reward circuitry, in vivo neuroimaging research targeting the human habenula has been limited by its small size and low anatomical contrast. In this work, we have developed an objective semi-automated habenula segmentation scheme consisting of histogram-based thresholding, region growing, geometric constraints, and partial volume estimation steps. This segmentation scheme was designed around in vivo 3 T myelin-sensitive images, generated by taking the ratio of high-resolution T1w over T2w images. Due to the high myelin content of the habenula, the contrast-to-noise ratio with the thalamus in the in vivo 3T myelin-sensitive images was significantly higher than the T1w or T2w images alone. In addition, in vivo 7 T myelin-sensitive images (T1w over T2*w ratio images) and ex vivo proton density-weighted images, along with histological evidence from the literature, strongly corroborated the in vivo 3 T habenula myelin contrast used in the proposed segmentation scheme. The proposed segmentation scheme represents a step toward a scalable approach for objective segmentation of the habenula suitable for both morphological evaluation and habenula seed region selection in functional and diffusion MRI applications."

However, current use of RCM depends on qualitative examination by a human expert to look for specific features in the different strata of the skin. Developing approaches to quantify features in RCM imagery requires an automated understanding of what anatomical strata is present in a given en-face section. This work presents an automated approach using a bag of features approach to represent en-face sections and a logistic regression classifier to classify sections into one of four classes (stratum corneum, viable epidermis, dermal-epidermal junction and papillary dermis). This approach was developed and tested using a dataset of 308 depth stacks from 54 volunteers in two age groups (20-30 and 50-70 years of age). The classification accuracy on the test set was 85.6%. The mean absolute error in determining the interface depth for each of the stratum corneum/viable epidermis, viable epidermis/dermal-epidermal junction and dermal-epidermal junction/papillary dermis interfaces were 3.1 mum, 6.0 mum and 5.5 mum respectively. The probabilities predicted by the classifier in the test set showed that the classifier learned an effective model of the anatomy of human skin."

In this study we exploit and enhance platelet interactions in tumor microenvironments by introducing tumor-targeting and imaging functions. The first step in repurposing human platelets as vehicles for tumor-targeting was to inhibit platelet-aggregation by cytoplasmic-loading of kabiramide (KabC), a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization and membrane protrusion. KabC-Platelets can accumulate high levels of other membrane-permeable cytoxins and probes, including epidoxorubicin, carboxyfluorescein di-ester and chlorin-e6. Finally, mild reaction conditions were developed to couple tumor-targeting proteins and antibodies to KabC-platelets. Fluorescence microscopy studies showed KabC-platelets, surface-coupled with transferrin and Cy5, bind specifically to RPMI8226 and K562 cells, both of which over-express the transferrin receptor. Repurposed platelets circulate for upto 9-days a feature that increases their chance of interacting with target cells. KabC-platelets, surface-coupled with transferrin and Cy7, or chlorin-e6, and injected in immuno-compromised mice were shown to accumulate specifically in sub-cutaneous and intra-cranial myeloma xenotransplants. The high-contrast, in vivo fluorescence images recorded from repurposed platelets within early-stage myeloma is a consequence in part of their large size (phi~2microm), which allows them to transport 100 to 1000-times more targeting-protein and probe molecules respectively. Human platelets can be configured with a plurality of therapeutic and targeting antibodies to help stage tumor environments for an immunotherapy, or with combinations of therapeutic antibodies and therapeutic agents to target and treat cardiovascular and neurologic diseases."

Despite a wealth of tumor histology data, including anti-pimonidazole staining, no current methods use these data to induce a quantitative characterization of chronic tumor hypoxia in time and space. We use image-processing algorithms to develop a set of candidate image features that can formulate just such a quantitative description of xenographed colorectal chronic tumor hypoxia. Two features in particular give low-variance measures of chronic hypoxia near a vessel: intensity sampling that extends radially away from approximated blood vessel centroids, and multithresholding to segment tumor tissue into normal, hypoxic, and necrotic regions. From these features we derive a spatiotemporal logical expression whose truth value depends on its predicate clauses that are grounded in this histological evidence. As an alternative to the spatiotemporal logical formulation, we also propose a way to formulate a linear regression function that uses all of the image features to learn what chronic hypoxia looks like, and then gives a quantitative similarity score once it is trained on a set of histology images."

METHODS: Statistical modelling is a technique widely used for colour detection in computer vision. We have developed a statistical model of colour detection applicable to detection of stain colour in digital IHC images. Model was first trained by massive colour pixels collected semi-automatically. To speed up the training and detection processes, we removed luminance channel, Y channel of YCbCr colour space and chose 128 histogram bins which is the optimal number. A maximum likelihood classifier is used to classify pixels in digital slides into positively or negatively stained pixels automatically. The model-based tool was developed within ImageJ to quantify targets identified using IHC and histochemistry. RESULTS: The purpose of evaluation was to compare the computer model with human evaluation. Several large datasets were prepared and obtained from human oesophageal cancer, colon cancer and liver cirrhosis with different colour stains. Experimental results have demonstrated the model-based tool achieves more accurate results than colour deconvolution and CMYK model in the detection of brown colour, and is comparable to colour deconvolution in the detection of pink colour. We have also demostrated the proposed model has little inter-dataset variations. CONCLUSIONS: A robust and effective statistical model is introduced in this paper. The model-based interactive tool in ImageJ, which can create a visual representation of the statistical model and detect a specified colour automatically, is easy to use and available freely at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/ihc-toolbox/index.html . Testing to the tool by different users showed only minor inter-observer variations in results."

Recently, a correlation mapping technique has been applied to optical coherence tomography (OCT), which extends the capabilities of OCT to microcirculation morphology imaging. This technique, known as correlation mapping optical coherence tomography, has been shown to extract parameters, such as capillary density and vessel diameter, and key clinical markers associated with early changes in microvascular diseases. However, OCT has limited spatial resolution in both the transverse and depth directions. Here, we extend this correlation mapping technique to other microscopy modalities, including confocal microscopy, and take advantage of the higher spatial resolution offered by these modalities. The technique is achieved as a processing step on microscopy images and does not require any modification to the microscope hardware. Results are presented which show that this correlation mapping microscopy technique can extend the capabilities of conventional microscopy to enable mapping of vascular networks in vivo with high spatial resolution in both the transverse and depth directions."

Computer aided diagnosis of CLE images, using image processing and fractal analysis can be used to quantify the histological structures in the CLE generated images. The aim of this study is to develop an automatic diagnosis algorithm of colorectal cancer (CRC), based on fractal analysis and neural network modeling of the CLE-generated colon mucosa images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a series of 1035 artifact-free endomicroscopy images, obtained during CLE examinations from normal mucosa (356 images) and tumor regions (679 images). The images were processed using a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) medical imaging system in order to obtain an automatic diagnosis. The CAD application includes image reading and processing functions, a module for fractal analysis, grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) computation module, and a feature identification module based on the Marching Squares and linear interpolation methods. A two-layer neural network was trained to automatically interpret the imaging data and diagnose the pathological samples based on the fractal dimension and the characteristic features of the biological tissues. RESULTS: Normal colon mucosa is characterized by regular polyhedral crypt structures whereas malignant colon mucosa is characterized by irregular and interrupted crypts, which can be diagnosed by CAD. For this purpose, seven geometric parameters were defined for each image: fractal dimension, lacunarity, contrast correlation, energy, homogeneity, and feature number. Of the seven parameters only contrast, homogeneity and feature number were significantly different between normal and cancer samples. Next, a two-layer feed forward neural network was used to train and automatically diagnose the malignant samples, based on the seven parameters tested. The neural network operations were cross-entropy with the results: training: 0.53, validation: 1.17, testing: 1.17, and percent error, resulting: training: 16.14, validation: 17.42, testing: 15.48. The diagnosis accuracy error was 15.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Computed aided diagnosis via fractal analysis of glandular structures can complement the traditional histological and minimally invasive imaging methods. A larger dataset from colorectal and other pathologies should be used to further validate the diagnostic power of the method."

However, histopathology images contain a wealth of information related to the tumor histology, morphology and tumor-host interactions that is not accessible through these techniques. Thus, integrating the histopathology images in the biomarker discovery workflow could potentially lead to the identification of new image-based biomarkers and the refinement or even replacement of the existing genomic and proteomic signatures. However, extracting meaningful and robust image features to be mined jointly with genomic (and clinical, etc.) data represents a real challenge due to the complexity of the images. RESULTS: We developed a framework for integrating the histopathology images in the biomarker discovery workflow based on the bag-of-features approach - a method that has the advantage of being assumption-free and data-driven. The images were reduced to a set of salient patterns and additional measurements of their spatial distribution, with the resulting features being directly used in a standard biomarker discovery application. We demonstrated this framework in a search for prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer which resulted in the identification of several prognostic image features and a promising multimodal (imaging and genomic) prognostic signature. The source code for the image analysis procedures is freely available. CONCLUSIONS: The framework proposed allows for a joint analysis of images and gene expression data. Its application to a set of breast cancer cases resulted in image-based and combined (image and genomic) prognostic scores for relapse-free survival."
27065343,How Suitable is Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time-of-Flight for Metabolite Imaging from Clinical Formalin-Fixed and Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Samples in Comparison to Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry?,"Buck A, Balluff B, Voss A, Langer R, Zitzelsberger H, Aichler M, Walch A.",Anal Chem. 2016 May 17;88(10):5281-9. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00460. Epub 2016 May 2.,Buck A,Anal Chem,2016,2016/04/12,,,10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00460,"In research and clinical settings, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens are collected routinely and therefore this material constitutes a highly valuable source to gather insight in metabolic changes of diseases. Among mass spectrometry techniques to examine the molecular content of FFPE tissue, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is the most appropriate when morphological and histological features are to be related to metabolic information. Currently, high-resolution mass spectrometers are widely used for metabolomics studies. However, with regards to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI, no study has so far addressed the necessity of instrumental mass resolving power in terms of clinical diagnosis and prognosis using archived FFPE tissue. For this matter we performed for the first time a comprehensive comparison between a high mass resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer and a time-of-flight (TOF) instrument with lower mass resolving power. Spectra analysis revealed that about one-third of the detected peaks remained unresolved by MALDI-TOF, which led to a 3-5 times lower number of m/z features compared to FTICR measurements. Overlaid peak information and background noise in TOF images made a precise assignment of molecular attributes to morphological features more difficult and limited classification approaches. This clearly demonstrates the need for high-mass resolution capabilities for metabolite imaging. Nevertheless, MALDI-TOF allowed reproducing and verifying individual markers identified previously by MALDI-FTICR MSI. The systematic comparison gives rise to a synergistic combination of the different MSI platforms for high-throughput discovery and validation of biomarkers."

Manual techniques are still used in diseases diagnosis that is very lingering and tedious process. However, machine based automatic analysis of leukocyte is a powerful tool that could reduce the human errors, improve the accuracy, and minimize the required time for blood cell analysis. However, leukocyte segmentation is a challenging process due to the complexity of the blood cell image; therefore, this task remains unresolved issue in the blood cell segmentation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to develop an efficient leukocyte cell segmentation and classification system. METHODS: This paper presents an efficient strategy to segment cell images. This has been achieved by using Wiener filter along with Curvelet transform for image enhancement and noise elimination in order to elude false edges. We have also used combination of entropy filter, thresholding and mathematical morphology for obtaining image segmentation and boundary detection, whereas we have used back-propagation neural network for leukocyte classification into its sub classes. RESULTS: As a result, the generated segmentation results are fruitful in a sense that we have overcome the problem of overlapping cells.

SICM can be used to analyze cell morphology at nanoscale, follow membrane dynamics, precisely position an imaging nanopipette close to a structure of interest, and use it to obtain ion channel recordings or locally apply stimuli or drugs. Practical implementations of these SICM advantages, however, are often complicated due to the limitations of currently available SICM systems that inherited their design from other scanning probe microscopes in which the scan assembly is placed right above the specimen. Such arrangement makes the setting of optimal illumination necessary for phase contrast or the use of high magnification upright optics difficult. Here, we describe the designs that allow mounting SICM scan head on a standard patch-clamp micromanipulator and imaging the sample at an adjustable approach angle. This angle could be as shallow as the approach angle of a patch-clamp pipette between a water immersion objective and the specimen. Using this angular approach SICM, we obtained topographical images of cells grown on nontransparent nanoneedle arrays, of islets of Langerhans, and of hippocampal neurons under upright optical microscope. We also imaged previously inaccessible areas of cells such as the side surfaces of the hair cell stereocilia and the intercalated disks of isolated cardiac myocytes, and performed targeted patch-clamp recordings from the latter. Thus, our new, to our knowledge, angular approach SICM allows imaging of living cells on nontransparent substrates and a seamless integration with most patch-clamp setups on either inverted or upright microscopes, which would facilitate research in cell biophysics and physiology."

While various dementia-related losses in cognitive functioning are its hallmark clinical symptoms, ultimate diagnosis is based on manual neuropathological assessments using various schemas, including Braak staging, CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) and Thal phase scoring. Since these scoring systems are based on subjective assessment, there is inevitably some degree of variation between readers, which could affect ultimate neuropathology diagnosis. Here, we report a pilot study investigating the applicability of computer-driven image analysis for characterizing neuropathological features, as well as its potential to supplement or even replace manually derived ratings commonly performed in medical settings. In this work, we quantitatively measured amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque in various brain regions from 34 patients using a robust digital quantification algorithm. We next verified these digitally derived measures to the manually derived pathology ratings using correlation and ordinal logistic regression methods, while also investigating the association with other AD-related neuropathology scoring schema commonly used at autopsy, such as Braak and CERAD. In addition to successfully verifying our digital measurements of Abeta plaques with respective categorical measurements, we found significant correlations with most AD-related scoring schemas. Our results demonstrate the potential for digital analysis to be adapted to more complex staining procedures commonly used in neuropathological diagnosis. As the efficiency of scanning and digital analysis of histology images increases, we believe that the basis of our semi-automatic approach may better standardize quantification of neuropathological changes and AD diagnosis, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of neurological disorders and more efficient patient care."

However, little is known about the pathogenesis of both diseases. We aimed to identify the differences in the distribution pattern of lipid molecules between atherosclerotic VAAs and FMD-associated VAAs. METHODS: We conducted a histological study of VAAs using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to assess the accumulation of lipid molecules in both the aneurysmal sac and the adjacent arteries without aneurysmal changes in 17 VAA samples, which were resected during the surgery. RESULTS: IMS revealed characteristic distributions of cholesterol ester in intima and media in the atherosclerotic VAAs, which was hardly detected in FMD-associated VAAs. However, lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), a proinflammatory and proapoptotic lipid mediator, was accumulated in the medial ridge of the adventitia of FMD-associated in the aneurysmal sac, and it was also diffusely accumulated in the adjacent arteries. In contrast, lysoPC was accumulated in the area of intimal hyperplasia in atherosclerotic VAAs and the adjacent arteries. CONCLUSION: The distribution patterns of lipid molecules were different between the FMD-associated and atherosclerotic VAAs. The diffuse accumulation of lysoPCs in the visceral arteries may be a predisposition for the formation of FMD-associated VAAs."

Approaches based on multiscale analysis and in particular the 'a trou' wavelet analysis has already been used for microscopy (Olivo Marin). In order to analyse texture changes, the statistical properties of the wavelet coefficient images were summarized by the first four statistical orders: mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the coefficient image histogram. The 'a trou' transform provided a representation of the wavelet coefficients and texture parameters with the same statistical robustness throughout the scale spaces. It was applied for quantifying chromatin texture and heat-induced chromatin changes in living cells. We investigated the changes by both laser scanning and spinning disk confocal microscopies and compared the texture parameters before and after increasing duration of heat shock exposure (15 min, 30 min and 1 h). Furthermore, as activation of the heat shock response also correlates with a rapid localization of HSF1 within a few nuclear structures termed nuclear stress bodies (nSBs), we compared the dynamics of nSBs formation with that of textural changes during 1 h of continuous heat shock. Next, we studied the recovery phase following a 1-h heat shock. Significant differences were observed, particularly affecting the perinucleolar region, even for the shortest heat shock time affecting mostly the skewness and standard deviation. Furthermore, progressive changes could be observed according to the duration of heat shock, mostly affecting fine details (pixel-wise changes) as revealed by the parameters, obtained from the first- and second-order wavelet coefficients. 'A trou' wavelet texture analysis provided a sensitive and efficient tool to investigate minute changes of chromatin."

Presence of pools of extracellular mucin is one of the most important histological features for MC. This paper aims at developing a quantitative computer-aided methodology for automated identification of mucin areas and its percentage using tissue histological images. The proposed method includes pre-processing (i.e., colour space transformation and colour normalization), mucin regions segmentation, post-processing, and performance evaluation. The proposed algorithm achieved 97.74% segmentation accuracy in comparison to ground truths. In addition, the percentage of mucin present in the tissue regions is calculated by the mucin index (MI) for grading MC (pure, moderately, minimally mucinous)."

Recently, manifold learning (ML) has been used to perform CBIR in a low dimensional representation of the high dimensional image descriptor space to avoid the curse of dimensionality. ML schemes are computationally expensive, requiring an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) for every new query image to learn its low dimensional representation. We present out-of-sample extrapolation utilizing semi-supervised ML (OSE-SSL) to learn the low dimensional representation without recomputing the EVD for each query image. OSE-SSL incorporates semantic information, partial class label, into a ML scheme such that the low dimensional representation co-localizes semantically similar images. In the context of prostate histopathology, gland morphology is an integral component of the Gleason score which enables discrimination between prostate cancer aggressiveness. Images are represented by shape features extracted from the prostate gland. CBIR with OSE-SSL for prostate histology obtained from 58 patient studies, yielded an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.53 +/- 0.03 comparatively a CBIR with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to learn a low dimensional space yielded an AUPRC of 0.44 +/- 0.01."

Texture analysis is commonly used to address this problem; mainly in the context of estimating the tumour/stroma ratio on histological samples. However, although histological images typically contain more than two tissue types, only few studies have addressed the multi-class problem. For colorectal cancer, one of the most prevalent tumour types, there are in fact no published results on multiclass texture separation. In this paper we present a new dataset of 5,000 histological images of human colorectal cancer including eight different types of tissue. We used this set to assess the classification performance of a wide range of texture descriptors and classifiers. As a result, we found an optimal classification strategy that markedly outperformed traditional methods, improving the state of the art for tumour-stroma separation from 96.9% to 98.6% accuracy and setting a new standard for multiclass tissue separation (87.4% accuracy for eight classes). We make our dataset of histological images publicly available under a Creative Commons license and encourage other researchers to use it as a benchmark for their studies."

However, it was recently reported that this pathway might not be universal: depletion of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enhances insulin sensitivity alongside hepatic lipid accumulation in mice, but the mechanistic role of microscopic lipid structure in this effect remains unclear. Here we study the effect of Entinostat, a synthetic HDAC inhibitor undergoing clinical trials, on hepatic lipid metabolism in the paradigmatic HepaRG liver cell line. Specifically, we statistically quantify lipid droplet morphology at single cell level utilizing label-free microscopy, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, supported by gene expression. We observe Entinostat efficiently rerouting carbohydrates and free-fatty acids into lipid droplets, upregulating lipid coat protein gene Plin4, and relocating droplets nearer to the nucleus. Our results demonstrate the power of Entinostat to promote lipid synthesis and storage, allowing reduced systemic sugar levels and sequestration of toxic metabolites within protected protein-coated droplets, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome."

CLE could be a valuable tool for the detection and characterization of suspicious (dysplastic) areas on the uterine cervix in a minimally invasive manner. This study evaluates the technical feasibility and safety of CLE on the cervix. The study also aims to create a preliminary iconography of normal and dysplastic squamous and columnar cervical epithelium. In-vivo CLE was performed on nine patients scheduled for a cervical loop electric excision procedure for high-grade superficial intraepithelial lesions. The CLE images were compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin analysis of loop electric excision procedure specimens. The histopathological diagnosis on the surgical specimen was established as per standard of care. CLE images were then reviewed by pathologists to point out specific histopathological features. pCLE of the exocervix and the transformation zone was performed successfully on seven out of nine patients. Uninterpretable images were obtained in two other cases: one using the AlveoFlex and one using the GastroFlex UHD after the application of acetic acid 2%. A total of 82.5% of the sequences recorded with the GastroFlex were suitable for interpretation. No adverse event or complications occurred. CLE enables proper in-vivo imaging of healthy and dysplastic cervical tissue. Images correlate well with the histopathological features established through traditional histology. Future blinded prospective analysis will determine the reliability of the real-time diagnosis and its potential use in the assessment and treatment of cervical lesions."

STUDY DESIGN: The medial surface geometries of five excised porcine larynges were quantified and reported. METHODS: Five porcine larynges were imaged in a micro-CT scanner, frozen, and rescanned. Segmentations and three-dimensional reconstructions were used to quantify and characterize geometric features. Comparisons were made with geometry data previously obtained using canine and human vocal folds as well as geometries of selected synthetic vocal fold models. RESULTS: Freezing induced an overall expansion of approximately 5% in the transverse plane and comparable levels of nonuniform distortion in sagittal and coronal planes. The medial surface of the porcine vocal folds was found to compare reasonably well with other geometries, although the compared geometries exhibited a notable discrepancy with one set of published human female vocal fold geometry. CONCLUSIONS: Porcine vocal folds are qualitatively geometrically similar to data available for canine and human vocal folds, as well as commonly used models. Freezing of tissue in the larynx causes distortion of around 5%. The data can provide direction in estimating uncertainty due to bulk distortion of tissue caused by freezing, as well as quantitative geometric data that can be directly used in developing vocal fold models."

Epub 2016 May 11.,Mills D,Dig Endosc,2016,2016/04/14,,,10.1111/den.12667,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Colonoscopy is sensitive at detecting large polyps; however, a significant polyp miss rate is still recognized. Indicators such as the adenoma detection rate (ADR) and, more recently, the adenoma per colonoscopy rate (APC) are increasingly used to ensure quality in colonoscopy. We carried out a prospective, randomized, controlled study evaluating improvement in adenoma detection between wide-screen, high-definition (WSHD) monitors compared to standard monitors (SD). METHODS: Patients undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy were randomized to a WSHD room or SD. Polyp size, location, shape, and histology were recorded. Right-sided polyps were considered to be those proximal to the splenic flexure. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were enrolled in the study, with 78 (51.3%) and 74 (48.7%) enrolled in the WSHD and SD groups, respectively. A 10% absolute difference in favor of the WSHD group was noted for the ADR (41% vs 31% patients); however, the difference was statistically not significant. In the WSHD and SD groups, APC of 0.9 +/- 1.4 versus 0.7 +/- 1.4 (P = 0.49) were noted, respectively. For polyps <5 mm, an ADR of 0.3 +/- 0.4 versus 0.2 +/- 0.4 (P = 0.34) and APC of 0.5 +/- 1.1 versus 0.2 +/- 0.5 (P = 0.06) were seen in the WSHD and SD groups. CONCLUSION: This study shows a trend toward improvement in ADR, with an increase in APC for small adenomas that approaches statistical significance. WSHD monitors are a one-time, low-cost intervention for improving the quality of colonoscopy with potentially favorable outcomes."

Epub 2016 Apr 27.,Dai Y,NMR Biomed,2016,2016/04/28,,,10.1002/nbm.3535,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and to correlate DKI parameters with tumor cellularity. Fifty-nine patients with pathologically diagnosed ccRCCs were evaluated by DKI on a 3-T scanner. Regions of interest were drawn on the maps of the mean diffusion coefficient (MD) and mean diffusion kurtosis (MK). All ccRCCs were histologically graded according to the Fuhrman classification system. Tumor cellularity was measured by the nuclear-to-cytoplasm (N/C) ratio and the number of tumor cell nuclei (NTCN). ccRCCs were classified as grade 1 (n = 23), grade 2 (n = 24), grade 3 (n = 10) and grade 4 (n = 3). Both MD and MK could readily discriminate between normal renal parenchyma and ccRCCs (p < 0.001), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that MK exhibited a better performance with an area under the ROC curve of 0.874 and sensitivity/specificity of 68.33%/100% (p < 0.001). Further, MD and MK were significantly different between grade 1 and grades 3 and 4 (p = 0.01, p < 0.001) and between grade 2 and grades 3 and 4 (p = 0.015, p < 0.005), respectively. However, no significant difference was found between grade 1 and grade 2 (p > 0.05) for both MD and MK. With regard to NTCN, no significant difference was found between any two grades (p > 0.05), and the N/C ratio changed significantly with grade (p < 0.01, between any two grades). Negative correlations were found between MK and MD (r = -0.56, p < 0.001), and between MD and N/C ratio (r = -0.36, p < 0.005), whereas MK and the N/C ratio were positively correlated (r = 0.45, p = 0.003). DKI could quantitatively characterize ccRCC with different grades by probing non-Gaussian diffusion properties related to changes in the tumor microenvironment or tissue complexities in the tumor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3T MR images of 68 patients with 85 cancer suspicious lesions were analyzed. The findings were correlated with histopathology. T2w imaging (T2WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE), and MR-Spectroscopy (MRS) were acquired. Every lesion was given a single PI-RADS score for each parameter, as well as a sum score and a PI-RADS v2 score. Furthermore, T2-morphology, ADC-value, perfusion type, citrate/choline-level, and localization were evaluated. RESULTS: 44 of 85 lesions showed PCa (51.8%), 21 chronic prostatitis (24.7%), and 20 other benign tissue such as hyperplasia or fibromuscular tissue (23.5%). The single PI-RADS score for T2WI, DWI, DCE, as well as the aggregated score including and not including MRS, and the PI-RADS v2-score were all significantly higher for PCa than for prostatitis or other tissue (p<0.001). The single PI-RADS score for MRS and the PI-RADS sum score including MRS were significantly higher for prostatitis than for other tissue (p=0.029 and p=0.020), whereas the other parameters were not different. Prostatitis usually presented borderline pathological PI-RADS scores, showed restricted diffusion with ADC>/=900mm(2)/s in 100% of cases, was more often indistinctly hypointense on T2WI (66.7%), and localized in the transitional zone (57.1%). An ADC>/=900mm(2)/s achieved the highest predictive value for prostatitis (AUC=0.859). CONCLUSION: Prostatitis can be differentiated from PCa using PI-RADS, since all available parameters are more distinct in cases of cancer. However, there is significant overlap between prostatitis and other benign findings, thus PI-RADS is only suitable to a limited extent for the primary assessment of prostatitis. Restricted diffusion with ADC>/=900mm(2)/s is believed to be a good indicator for prostatitis. MRS can help to distinguish between prostatitis and other tissue."

Epub 2016 Jun 6.,Absinta M,J Clin Invest,2016,2016/06/09,PMC4922708,,10.1172/JCI86198,"BACKGROUND: In some active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, a strong immune reaction at the lesion edge may contain growth and thereby isolate the lesion from the surrounding parenchyma. Our previous studies suggest that this process involves opening of the blood-brain barrier in capillaries at the lesion edge, seen on MRI as centripetal contrast enhancement and a colocalized phase rim. We hypothesized that using these features to characterize early lesion evolution will allow in vivo tracking of tissue degeneration and/or repair, thus improving the evaluation of potential therapies for chronic active lesions. METHODS: Centripetally and centrifugally enhancing lesions were studied in 17 patients with MS using 7-tesla MRI. High-resolution, susceptibility-weighted, T1-weighted (before/after gadolinium), and dynamic contrast-enhanced scans were acquired at baseline and months 1, 3, 6, and 12. For each lesion, time evolution of the phase rim, lesion volume, and T1 hypointensity were assessed. In autopsies of 3 progressive MS cases, the histopathology of the phase rim was determined. RESULTS: In centripetal lesions, a phase rim colocalized with initial contrast enhancement. In 12 of 22, this phase rim persisted after enhancement resolved. Compared with centripetal lesions with transient rim, those with persistent rim had less volume shrinkage and became more T1 hypointense between months 3 and 12. No centrifugal lesions developed phase rims at any time point. Pathologically, persistent rims corresponded to an iron-laden inflammatory myeloid cell population at the edge of chronic demyelinated lesions. CONCLUSION: In early lesion evolution, a persistent phase rim in lesions that shrink least and become more T1 hypointense over time suggests that the rim might mark failure of early lesion repair and/or irreversible tissue damage. In later stages of MS, phase rim lesions continue to smolder, exerting detrimental effects on affected brain tissue. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00001248.

In this prospective randomized controlled study, we evaluated the impact of SS microscope-integrated OCT (MI-OCT) on ophthalmology residents' performance of ophthalmic microsurgical maneuvers. METHODS: Fourteen ophthalmology residents from a single institution were stratified by year of training and randomized to perform four anterior segment surgical maneuvers on porcine eyes with (MI-OCT+) or without (MI-OCT-) direct intraoperative OCT guidance. Subsequently, both groups repeated the same maneuvers without MI-OCT feedback to test whether initial MI-OCT experience affected subsequent surgical performance. Finally, the MI-OCT- group was crossed over and allowed to repeat the same maneuvers with direct MI-OCT guidance. Each resident completed a survey at the completion of the study. RESULTS: With direct MI-OCT feedback, residents demonstrated enhanced performance in depth-based anterior segment maneuvers (corneal suture passes at 50% and 90% depth and corneal laceration repair) compared with the residents operating without MI-OCT. Microscope-integrated OCT+ residents continued to outperform the controls when both groups subsequently operated without MI-OCT. For clear corneal wound geometry, there was no statistically significant effect of MI-OCT as applied in this study. Overall, the resident surgeons rated their subjective experience of using MI-OCT very favorably. CONCLUSIONS: Microscope-integrated OCT feedback enhances performance of ophthalmology residents in select anterior segment surgical maneuvers. Microscope-integrated OCT represents a valuable tool in the surgical education of ophthalmology residents."

Mining this data often results in two crucial bottlenecks: 1) high dimensionality of features used to represent rich biological data and 2) small amounts of labelled training data due to the expense of consulting highly specific medical expertise necessary to assess each study. Currently, no approach that we are aware of has attempted to use active learning in the context of dimensionality reduction approaches for improving the construction of low dimensional representations. We present our novel methodology, AdDReSS (Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction with Semi-Supervision), to demonstrate that fewer labeled instances identified via AL in embedding space are needed for creating a more discriminative embedding representation compared to randomly selected instances. We tested our methodology on a wide variety of domains ranging from prostate gene expression, ovarian proteomic spectra, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and breast histopathology. Across these various high dimensional biomedical datasets with 100+ observations each and all parameters considered, the median classification accuracy across all experiments showed AdDReSS (88.7%) to outperform SSAGE, a SSDR method using random sampling (85.5%), and Graph Embedding (81.5%). Furthermore, we found that embeddings generated via AdDReSS achieved a mean 35.95% improvement in Raghavan efficiency, a measure of learning rate, over SSAGE. Our results demonstrate the value of AdDReSS to provide low dimensional representations of high dimensional biomedical data while achieving higher classification rates with fewer labelled examples as compared to without active learning."

METHODS: Synovial tissue of 20 patients (11 RA, 9 OA) was immunohistochemically stained for macrophages (CD68), synovial fibroblasts (CD55), T cells (CD3), plasma cells (CD38), endothelial cells (vWF) and mast cells (MCT). The synovial sublining layer was divided into predefined adjacent zones and fractions of the stained area (SA) were determined by digital image analysis for each cell marker. RESULTS: Distribution of CD68, CD55, CD38 and MCT staining of the sublining area was heterogeneous (Friedman ANOVA p < 0.05). The highest expression for all markers was observed in the upper layer close to the lining layer with a decrease in the middle and lower sublining. The SA of CD68, CD55 and CD38 was significantly higher in all layers of RA tissue compared to OA (p < 0.05), except the CD38 fraction of the lower sublining. Based on receiver operating characteristics analysis, CD68 SA of the total sublining resulted in the highest area under the curve (AUC 0.944, CI 95 % 0.844-1.0, p = 0.001) followed by CD68 in the upper and middle layer respectively (both AUC 0.933, CI 95 % 0.816-1.0, p = 0.001) in both RA and OA. Linear mixed modelling confirmed significant differences in the SA of sublining CD68 between OA and RA (p = 0.0042) with a higher concentration of CD68+ towards the lining layer and more rapid decline towards the periphery of the sublining in RA compared to OA (p = 0.0022). CONCLUSIONS: Immune cells are inhomogeneously distributed within the sublining layer. RA and OA tissue display differences in the number of CD68 macrophages and differences in CD68 decline within the synovial sublining."

The ability to segment and detect glands among other types of tissues is important for the study of normal and disease processes and helps their analysis and visualization by pathologists in microscopic detail. METHODS: In this paper, we develop a new approach for segmenting and detecting intestinal glands in H&E-stained histology images, which utilizes a set of advanced image processing techniques: graph search, ensemble, feature extraction, and classification. Our method is computationally fast, preserves gland boundaries robustly and detects glands accurately. RESULTS: We tested the performance of our gland detection and segmentation method by analyzing a dataset of over 1700 glands in digitized high resolution clinical histology images obtained from normal and diseased human intestines. The experimental results show that our method outperforms considerably the state-of-the-art methods for gland segmentation and detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our method can produce high-quality segmentation and detection of non-overlapped glands that obey the natural property of glands in histology tissue images. With accurately detected and segmented glands, quantitative measurement and analysis can be developed for further studies of glands and computer-aided diagnosis."

We developed a quantitative method for analyzing the location of ependymoma in the posterior fossa, tested its effectiveness in distinguishing groups of tumors, and examined potential associations of distinct tumor groups with treatment and prognostic factors. METHODS: Pre-operative MRI examinations of the brain for 38 children with histopathologically proven posterior fossa ependymoma were analyzed. Tumor margin contours and anatomic landmarks were manually marked and used to calculate the centroid of each tumor. Landmarks were used to calculate a transformation to align, scale, and rotate each patient's image coordinates to a common coordinate space. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the location and morphological variables was performed to detect multivariate patterns in tumor characteristics. The ependymomas were also characterized as ""central"" or ""lateral"" based on published radiological criteria. Therapeutic details and demographic, recurrence, and survival information were obtained from medical records and analyzed with the tumor location and morphology to identify prognostic tumor characteristics. RESULTS: Cluster analysis yielded two distinct tumor groups based on centroid location The cluster groups were associated with differences in PFS (p = .044), ""central"" vs. ""lateral"" radiological designation (p = .035), and marginally associated with multiple operative interventions (p = .064). CONCLUSIONS: Posterior fossa ependymoma can be objectively classified based on quantitative analysis of tumor location, and these classifications are associated with prognostic and treatment factors."

Epub 2016 Apr 22.,Annunziata R,Med Image Anal,2016,2016/05/03,,,10.1016/j.media.2016.04.006,"Recent clinical research has highlighted important links between a number of diseases and the tortuosity of curvilinear anatomical structures like corneal nerve fibres, suggesting that tortuosity changes might detect early stages of specific conditions. Currently, clinical studies are mainly based on subjective, visual assessment, with limited repeatability and inter-observer agreement. To address these problems, we propose a fully automated framework for image-level tortuosity estimation, consisting of a hybrid segmentation method and a highly adaptable, definition-free tortuosity estimation algorithm. The former combines an appearance model, based on a Scale and Curvature-Invariant Ridge Detector (SCIRD), with a context model, including multi-range learned context filters. The latter is based on a novel tortuosity estimation paradigm in which discriminative, multi-scale features can be automatically learned for specific anatomical objects and diseases. Experimental results on 140 in vivo confocal microscopy images of corneal nerve fibres from healthy and unhealthy subjects demonstrate the excellent performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches and ground truth annotations from 3 expert observers."

Upon automated precharacterization into 21 categories, the software offers the possibility of reclassification of RBCs by the operator. We aimed to define the optimal cut-off to detect morphological RBC abnormalities and to evaluate the precharacterization performance of this software. METHODS: Thirty-eight blood samples of healthy donors and sixty-eight samples of hospitalized patients were analyzed. Different methodologies to define a cut-off between negativity and positivity were used. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to these different cut-offs using the manual microscopic method as the gold standard. Imprecision was assessed by measuring analytical within-run and between-run variability and by measuring between-observer variability. RESULTS: By optimizing the cut-off between negativity and positivity, sensitivities exceeded 80% for 'critical' RBC categories (target cells, tear drop cells, spherocytes, sickle cells, and parasites), while specificities exceeded 80% for the other RBC morphological categories. Results of within-run, between-run, and between-observer variabilities were all clinically acceptable. CONCLUSION: The CellaVision Advanced RBC Software Application is an easy-to-use software that helps to detect most RBC morphological abnormalities in a sensitive and specific way without increasing work load, provided the proper cut-offs are chosen. However, evaluation of the images by an experienced observer remains necessary."

Epub 2016 May 27.,Mohme M,World Neurosurg,2016,2016/06/01,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.05.046,"OBJECTIVE: Secretory meningioma (SM) is a rare histologic subtype known to cause disproportional peritumoral brain edema. Although meningiomas are defined by slow growth and mostly manifest with benign clinical symptoms, SMs can cause life-threatening deterioration. The aim of this study was to characterize the potential pitfalls in treatment of SMs by illustrating their characteristic clinical features. METHODS: We analyzed 69 patients with SM who underwent surgery at our institution and compared them with a matched nonsecretory meningioma cohort. Retrospective data were analyzed for frequency of seizures as the first presenting symptom, maximum corticosteroid use, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay. In addition, histologic and radiographic data were evaluated for the extent of peritumoral brain edema formation, tumor location, and tumor size and correlated to clinical presentation. RESULTS: Seizures were observed at a significantly higher rate as the first presenting symptom leading to clinical admission in patients with SM (33.3%) compared with the matched nonsecretory meningioma cohort (13%, P = 0.008). In patients with SM, seizures were associated with increased edema formation, whereas seizures in patients with nonsecretory meningioma correlated with tumor size (P = 0.007). The clinically more complicated course in patients with SM was reflected by increased demand for corticosteroids and a prolonged intensive care unit stay (P < 0.001). SM further showed a higher recurrence rate of 35.9% compared with a cohort of 320 World Health Organization grade I meningiomas resected at our institution (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the complicated clinical course of this rare histologic meningioma subtype. The increased frequency of seizures may enable raised awareness of clinicians for potential complications and treatment adjustments perioperatively early at clinical admission."

A lot of progress has been made in the development of molecular based assays, but many of the cases still require the careful analysis of the stained tissue under a bright-field microscope and its analysis. This procedure is costly and time-consuming. We present a novel method for classification of cancer cells in lymph node images. It is based on the measurement of the spectral image of hematoxylin and eosin stained sample under the microscope and the analysis of the acquired data using state of the art machine learning techniques. The method is based on the analysis of the spectral information of the cells as well as their morphological properties. A large number of descriptors is extracted for each cell location, which are used to train a supervised classifier which discriminates between normal and cancer cells. We show that a reliable analysis can be made with detection rate (recall) of 81%-100% for the cancer class."

The overall process is described using imaging data acquired from an India-ink perfused C57BL/6J mouse brain using Knife Edge Scanning Microscopy. We illustrate the procedure through segmentation of cerebral vasculature structures from mechanical noise using trained classifiers. The features extracted by our procedure show high discriminatory power between classes; the classifiers (linear SVM, Gaussian SVM, and GentleBoost decision tree ensemble) trained using these features achieved high performance: F1-scores reported for linear SVM, Gaussian SVM, and GentleBoost decision tree ensemble were 0.963, 0.956, and 0.963 respectively."

However, human evaluation of pathology slides cannot accurately predict patients' prognoses. In this study, we obtain 2,186 haematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology whole-slide images of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 294 additional images from Stanford Tissue Microarray (TMA) Database. We extract 9,879 quantitative image features and use regularized machine-learning methods to select the top features and to distinguish shorter-term survivors from longer-term survivors with stage I adenocarcinoma (P<0.003) or squamous cell carcinoma (P=0.023) in the TCGA data set. We validate the survival prediction framework with the TMA cohort (P<0.036 for both tumour types). Our results suggest that automatically derived image features can predict the prognosis of lung cancer patients and thereby contribute to precision oncology. Our methods are extensible to histopathology images of other organs."

Epub 2016 Feb 23.,de Perrot T,J Magn Reson Imaging,2016,2016/02/26,,,10.1002/jmri.25206,"PURPOSE: To assess the influence of perfusion on apparent coefficient diffusion (ADC) maps, the contribution of b-value images, and the number of b-values needed in prostate cancer detection by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients scheduled for prostatectomy were scanned by 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with DWI based on b-values 0-500-1000-1500 s/mm(2) . A monoexponential model was fitted to obtain ADC using multiple b-values, with or without b0 (perfusion-sensitive ADC4b-b0-500-1000-1500 , perfusion-insensitive ADC3b-b500-1000-1500 ), or two b-values (ADC2b-b0-500 , ADC2b-b0-1000 , ADC2b-b0-1500 ). Prostate and cancer foci were segmented to label voxels as normal or tumoral, according to histology. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated for each ADC and b-value, then for multivariate logistic regression models combining them. A threshold of 85 tumoral voxels (=0.5 cm(3) ) was used to stratify AUC analysis. RESULTS: In all, 21 patients were selected. Segmentation collected 143,665 prostatic voxels including 10,069 tumoral voxels. In five patients, tumor segmentation provided fewer than 85 voxels, resulting in an ADC with AUC inferior to 0.52. In 16 patients with larger tumors, perfusion-sensitive ADC4b-b0-500-1000-1500 performed better than perfusion-insensitive ADC3b-b500-1000-1500 and similar to ADC2b-b0-1500 (AUC of 0.840, 0.809, and 0.838, respectively). In comparison to the ADC alone, models combining ADC4b-b0-500-1000-1500 or ADC2b-b0-1500 with b1500 improved performance, leading to similar AUCs of 0.884 and 0.883, respectively. In both models, ADC and b1500 were significant markers (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Including b0 in ADC calculation provided superior ADC maps for prostate cancer detection. b1500 images as a combined parameter with ADC also improved performance. Using more than two b-values showed no improvement. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:601-609."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, multi-reader study was conducted of 83 mammographic examinations of women with 107 newly diagnosed ILCs ascertained at histology. Consenting women underwent both DM and DBT acquisitions. Twelve radiologists, with varying mammography experience, interpreted DM images alone, reporting lesion location, mammographic features, and malignancy probability using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 1-5; they then reviewed DBT images in addition to DM, and reported the same parameters. Statistical analyses compared sensitivity, false-positive rates (FPR), and interpretive performance using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC), for reading with DM versus DM plus DBT. RESULTS: Multi-reader pooled ROC analysis for DM plus DBT yielded AUC=0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.91), which was significantly higher (p<0.0001) than DM alone with AUC=0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86). DBT plus DM significantly increased pooled sensitivity (85%) compared to DM alone (70%; p<0.0001). FPR did not vary significantly with the addition of DBT to DM. Interpreting with DBT (compared to DM alone) increased the correct identification of ILCs depicted as architectural distortions (84% versus 65%, respectively) or as masses (89% versus 70%), increasing interpretive performance for both experienced and less-experienced readers; larger gains in AUC were shown for less-experienced radiologists. Multifocal and/or multicentric and bilateral disease was more frequently identified on DM with DBT. CONCLUSION: Adding DBT to DM significantly improved the accuracy of mammographic interpretation for ILCs and contributed to characterising disease extent."

We aimed to investigate the anti-cancer mechanism of G6PD deficiency. In our study, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and shRNA technology were used for inhibiting the activity of G6PD of cervical cancer cells. Peak Force QNM Atomic Force Microscopy was used to assess the changes of topography and biomechanical properties of cells and detect the effects on living cells in a natural aqueous environment. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe cell morphology. Moreover, a laser scanning confocal microscope was used to observe the alterations in cytoskeleton to explore the involved mechanism. When G6PD was inhibited by DHEA or RNA interference, the abnormal Young's modulus and increased roughness of cell membrane were observed in HeLa cells, as well as the idioblasts. Simultaneously, G6PD deficiency resulted in decreased HeLa cells migration and proliferation ability but increased ROS generation inducing apoptosis. What's more, the inhibition of G6PD activity caused the disorganization of microfilaments and microtubules of cytoskeletons and cell shrinkage. Our results indicated the anti-cervix cancer mechanism of G6PD deficiency may be involved with the decreased cancer cells migration and proliferation ability as a result of abnormal reorganization of cell cytoskeleton and abnormal biomechanical properties caused by the increased ROS. Suppression of G6PD may be a promising strategy in developing novel therapeutic methods for cervical cancer."

The goal of this study was to compare biplane angiographic vs. intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) derived reconstructed coronary geometries to evaluate agreement in geometry, computed WSS, and association of WSS and CAD progression. Baseline and 6-month follow-up angiographic and IVUS imaging data were collected in patients with non-obstructive CAD (n = 5). Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the coronary arteries were generated with each technique, and patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models were constructed to compute baseline WSS values. Geometric comparisons were evaluated in arterial segments (n = 9), and hemodynamic data were evaluated in circumferential sections (n = 468). CAD progression was quantified from serial IVUS imaging data (n = 277), and included virtual-histology IVUS (VH-IVUS) derived changes in plaque composition. There was no significant difference in reconstructed coronary segment lengths and cross-sectional areas (CSA), however, IVUS derived geometries exhibited a significantly larger left main CSA than the angiographic reconstructions. Computed absolute time-averaged WSS (TAWSS(ABS)) values were significantly greater in the IVUS derived geometries, however, evaluations of relative TAWSS (TAWSS(REL)) values revealed improved agreement and differences within defined zones of equivalence. Associations between VH-IVUS defined CAD progression and angiographic or IVUS derived WSS exhibited poor agreement when examining TAWSS(ABS) data, but improved when evaluating the association with TAWSS(REL) data. We present data from a small cohort of patients highlighting strong agreement between angiographic and IVUS derived coronary geometries, however, limited agreement is observed between computed WSS values and associations of WSS with CAD progression."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 48 single pulmonary nodules and masses were retrospectively evaluated. All lesions were histologically or clinically confirmed (malignancy: inflammation = 24:20). We utilized a newly introduced texture analysis method based on contrast-enhanced CT (first described by Grove et al.) that automatically divided the whole lesion volume into two regions: edge and core. Mean attenuation value (AV) and entropy of each region and also the whole lesion were evaluated separately. Each texture metric (absolute value for each region, and difference value defined as difference between edge and core) of malignant and inflammatory lesions were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Individual image parameters were combined by using linear discriminant analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to assess each texture metric and their combination for discriminating between the two entities. RESULTS: Mean AV difference and entropy difference were significantly higher in malignant lesions than in inflammatory lesions (4.71 HU +/- 5.06 vs -1.53 HU +/- 5.05, P < .001; 0.45 +/- 0.23 vs 0.18 +/- 0.30, P = .001). Receiver operating characteristic curves for individual mean AV difference and entropy difference provided relatively high values for the area under the curve (0.836 and 0.795, respectively). The combination of mean AV difference, entropy difference, and lesion volume improved the area under the curve to 0.864. CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity difference between edge and core by using whole-lesion texture analysis on contrast-enhanced CT may be a promising tool for estimating the probability of malignancy in pulmonary nodules and masses."

Occasionally distant non-enhancing lesions may be identified which have the appearances of a multicentric low-grade glioma. We aimed to determine the incidence, prognostic significance and diagnostic value of this appearance in new glioblastoma patients. Pre-operative MRIs of patients with a new diagnosis of glioblastoma were reviewed to identify multicentric non-enhancing lesions, defined as areas of FLAIR hyperintensity and mass effect, without post-contrast enhancement, separate from the histologically-proven glioblastoma. Patient survival was compared to glioblastoma patients without these appearances, and follow-up imaging was reviewed. Nine of 151 patients (6 %) had multicentric non-enhancing lesions. Their median survival of 183 days was significantly worse than the 278 days for patients without multicentric nonenhancing lesions (p = 0.025). Follow-up MRIs were performed in four patients. In one patient, there were several additional lesions, one of which developed evidence of necrosis within 22 days of presentation. In the other three patients, the multicentric lesions developed enhancement and evidence of necrosis within 1 year, and became confluent on FLAIR with the dominant lesion. The appearance of a multicentric non-enhancing lesion is an uncommon finding in glioblastoma, but a poor prognostic feature. These lesions progress faster than expected for a low-grade glioma and are thus likely to represent more advanced lesions than their appearances suggest. Confluence with the dominant lesion developing with time suggests that the tumor is more extensive than appreciated on imaging."

Cells are plated in multiwell plates, perturbed with the treatments to be tested, stained, fixed, and imaged on a high-throughput microscope. Next, an automated image analysis software identifies individual cells and measures  approximately 1,500 morphological features (various measures of size, shape, texture, intensity, and so on) to produce a rich profile that is suitable for the detection of subtle phenotypes. Profiles of cell populations treated with different experimental perturbations can be compared to suit many goals, such as identifying the phenotypic impact of chemical or genetic perturbations, grouping compounds and/or genes into functional pathways, and identifying signatures of disease.

The retardation and orientation of sample birefringence can then be measured simultaneously based on spectral multiplexing interferometry. Further, with the addition of a Nomarski prism, the same setup can be used for quantitative differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging. Sample phase can then be obtained with two-dimensional integration. In addition, birefringence-induced phase error can be corrected using the birefringence data. This dual-modality approach is analyzed theoretically with Jones calculus and validated experimentally with malaria-infected red blood cells. The system generates not only corrected DIC and phase images, but a birefringence map that highlights the distribution of hemozoin crystals."

It is commonly accepted that genomic RNA (gRNA) must be dimeric at the plasma membrane of the infected cells to be packaged during virus assembly. However, where, when and how HIV-1 gRNA find each other and dimerize in the cell are long-standing questions that cannot be answered using conventional approaches. Here, we combine two state-of-the-art, multicolor RNA labeling strategies with two single-molecule microscopy technologies to address these questions. We used 3D-super-resolution structured illumination microscopy to analyze and quantify the spatial gRNA association throughout the cell and monitored the dynamics of RNA-RNA complexes in living-cells by cross-correlation fluctuation analysis. These sensitive and complementary approaches, combined with trans-complementation experiments, reveal for the first time the presence of interacting gRNA in the cytosol, a challenging observation due to the low frequency of these events and their dilution among the bulk of other RNAs, and allow the determination of the subcellular orchestration of the HIV-1 dimerization process."

Recent reviews state that existing techniques show appreciable segmentation accuracy on breast histopathology images whose nuclei are dispersed and regular in texture and shape; however, typical cancer nuclei are often clustered and have irregular texture and shape properties. This paper proposes a novel segmentation algorithm for detecting individual nuclei from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained breast histopathology images. This detection framework estimates a nuclei saliency map using tensor voting followed by boundary extraction of the nuclei on the saliency map using a Loopy Back Propagation (LBP) algorithm on a Markov Random Field (MRF). The method was tested on both whole-slide images and frames of breast cancer histopathology images. Experimental results demonstrate high segmentation performance with efficient precision, recall and dice-coefficient rates, upon testing high-grade breast cancer images containing several thousand nuclei. In addition to the optimal performance on the highly complex images presented in this paper, this method also gave appreciable results in comparison with two recently published methods-Wienert et al. (2012) and Veta et al. (2013), which were tested using their own datasets."

METHODS: Fifty-four children with histopathologically confirmed brain tumors underwent diffusion MRI scans at 3Twith 12 b-values (0-4000 s/mm(2) ). The diffusion imageswere fit to a simplified CTRW model to extract anomalous diffusion coefficient, Dm , and temporal and spatial heterogeneity parameters, alpha and beta, respectively. Using histopathology results as reference, a k-means clustering algorithm and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were employed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the CTRW parameters in differentiating tumor grades. RESULTS: Significant differences between the low- and high-grade tumors were observed in the CTRW parameters (p-values<0.001). The k-means analysis showed that the combination of three CTRW parameters produced higher diagnostic accuracy (85% vs. 75%) and specificity (83% vs. 54%) than the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from a mono-exponential model. The ROC analysis revealed that any combination of the CTRW parameters gave a larger area under the curve (0.90-0.96) than using ADC (0.80). CONCLUSION: With its sensitivity to intravoxel heterogeneity, the simplified CTRW model is useful for non-invasive grading of pediatric brain tumors, particularly when surgical biopsy is not feasible.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 68 patients with histologically proven rectal carcinoma underwent an IVIM sequence (b = 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500, and 2000 s/mm(2) ) on a 3.0T MRI scanner. The IVIM parameters (D, D*, f, and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] values) in metastatic and nonmetastatic lymph nodes were measured and calculated. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to determine the optimal thresholds, the sensitivities, and specificities for differentiation. RESULTS: Mean D, f, and ADC values of metastatic lymph nodes were significantly greater than those of the normal lymph nodes (P < 0.01), whereas the mean D* value of metastatic lymph node was statistically lower (P = 0.03). The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and the cutoff value, respectively, for differentiating metastatic from nonmetastatic lymph nodes for D, D*, f, and ADC were as follows: D, 0.9460, 89.25%, 91.04%, and 1.14 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s; D*, 0.6930, 64.18%, 82.80%, and 7.02 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s; f, 0.7810, 92.47%, 55.22%, and 0.27%; ADC, 0.8970, 87.10%, 88.06%, and 0.80 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s. The ROC curves demonstrated that the area under the ROC (AUC) of the D, ADC, f, and D* values successively decreased, and D had the highest AUC, with D* values being lowest. CONCLUSION: An IVIM sequence may be helpful in diagnosing metastatic lymph nodes of rectal carcinoma. Average D and ADC values are more sensitive than f and D* values in this differentiation. J.

The aim is to estimate microscopic features specific to the intra- and extra-neurite compartments in nervous tissue unconfounded by the effects of fibre crossings and orientation dispersion, which are ubiquitous in the brain. The proposed MRI method is based on the Spherical Mean Technique (SMT), which factors out the neurite orientation distribution and thus provides direct estimates of the microscopic tissue structure. This technique can be immediately used in the clinic for the assessment of various neurological conditions, as it requires only a widely available off-the-shelf sequence with two b-shells and high-angular gradient resolution achievable within clinically feasible scan times. To demonstrate the developed method, we use high-quality diffusion data acquired with a bespoke scanner system from the Human Connectome Project. This study establishes the normative values of the new biomarkers for a large cohort of healthy young adults, which may then support clinical diagnostics in patients. Moreover, we show that the microscopic diffusion indices offer direct sensitivity to pathological tissue alterations, exemplified in a preclinical animal model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), a genetic multi-organ disorder which impacts brain microstructure and hence may lead to neurological manifestations such as autism, epilepsy and developmental delay."

Pathologist scoring of chromogen staining intensity is subjective and generates low-resolution ordinal or nominal data rather than continuous data. Emerging digital pathology platforms now allow quantification of chromogen or fluorescence signals by computer-assisted image analysis, providing continuous immunohistochemistry values. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry offers greater dynamic signal range than chromogen immunohistochemistry, and combined with image analysis holds the promise of enhanced sensitivity and analytic resolution, and consequently more robust quantification. However, commercial fluorescence scanners and image analysis software differ in features and capabilities, and claims of objective quantitative immunohistochemistry are difficult to validate as pathologist scoring is subjective and there is no accepted gold standard. Here we provide the first side-by-side validation of two technologically distinct commercial fluorescence immunohistochemistry analysis platforms. We document highly consistent results by (1) concordance analysis of fluorescence immunohistochemistry values and (2) agreement in outcome predictions both for objective, data-driven cutpoint dichotomization with Kaplan-Meier analyses or employment of continuous marker values to compute receiver-operating curves. The two platforms examined rely on distinct fluorescence immunohistochemistry imaging hardware, microscopy vs line scanning, and functionally distinct image analysis software. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry values for nuclear-localized and tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5a/b computed by each platform on a cohort of 323 breast cancer cases revealed high concordance after linear calibration, a finding confirmed on an independent 382 case cohort, with concordance correlation coefficients >0.98. Data-driven optimal cutpoints for outcome prediction by either platform were reciprocally applicable to the data derived by the alternate platform, identifying patients with low Nuc-pYStat5 at ~3.5-fold increased risk of disease progression. Our analyses identified two highly concordant fluorescence immunohistochemistry platforms that may serve as benchmarks for testing of other platforms, and low interoperator variability supports the implementation of objective tumor marker quantification in pathology laboratories."

Epub 2016 Jun 30.,Mori K,Med Image Anal,2016,2016/07/18,,,10.1016/j.media.2016.06.034,"This paper gives our perspective on the next two decades of computational anatomy, which has made great strides in the recognition and understanding of human anatomy from conventional clinical images. The results from this field are now used in a variety of medical applications, including quantitative analysis of organ shapes, interventional assistance, surgical navigation, and population analysis. Several anatomical models have also been used in computational anatomy, and these mainly target millimeter-scale shapes. For example, liver-shape models are almost completely modeled at the millimeter scale, and shape variations are described at such scales. Most clinical 3D scanning devices have had just under 1 or 0.5 mm per voxel resolution for over 25 years, and this resolution has not changed drastically in that time. Although Z-axis (head-to-tail direction) resolution has been drastically improved by the introduction of multi-detector CT scanning devices, in-plane resolutions have not changed very much either. When we look at human anatomy, we can see different anatomical structures at different scales. For example, pulmonary blood vessels and lung lobes can be observed in millimeter-scale images. If we take 10-microm-scale images of a lung specimen, the alveoli and bronchiole regions can be located in them. Most work in millimeter-scale computational anatomy has been done by the medical-image analysis community. In the next two decades, we encourage our community to focus on micro-scale computational anatomy. In this perspective paper, we briefly review the achievements of computational anatomy and its impacts on clinical applications; furthermore, we show several possibilities from the viewpoint of microscopic computational anatomy by discussing experimental results from our recent research activities."

Epub 2016 Aug 9.,Chua J,Ophthalmology,2016,2016/08/14,,,10.1016/j.ophtha.2016.06.034,"PURPOSE: To determine the association of iris surface features with iris volume change after physiologic pupil dilation in adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Chinese adults aged >/= 50 years without ocular diseases. METHODS: Digital iris photographs were taken from eyes of each participant and graded for crypts (by number and size) and furrows (by number and circumferential extent) following a standardized grading scheme. Iris color was measured objectively, using the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) L* color parameter (higher value denoting lighter iris). The anterior segment was imaged by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) (Casia; Tomey, Nagoya, Japan) under bright light and dark room conditions. Iris volumes in light and dark conditions were measured with custom semiautomated software, and the change in iris volume was quantified. Associations of the change in iris volume after pupil dilation with underlying iris surface features in right eyes were assessed using linear regression analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Iris volume change after physiologic pupil dilation from light to dark condition. RESULTS: A total of 65 Chinese participants (mean age, 59.8+/-5.7 years) had gradable data for iris surface features. In light condition, higher iris crypt grade was associated independently with smaller iris volume (beta [change in iris volume in millimeters per crypt grade increment] = -1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.26 to -0.59; P = 0.001) and greater reduction of iris volume on pupil dilation (beta [change in iris volume in millimeters per crypt grade increment] = 0.23, 95% CI, 0.06-0.40; P = 0.010), adjusting for age, gender, presence of corneal arcus, and change in pupil size. Iris furrows and iris color were not associated with iris volume in light condition or change in iris volume (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although few Chinese persons have multiple crypts on their irides, irides with more crypts were significantly thinner and lost more volume on pupil dilation. In view that the latter feature is known to be protective for acute angle-closure attack, it is likely that the macroscopic and microscopic composition of the iris is a contributing feature to angle-closure disease."

Prognostic value of fractal and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture analysis algorithms has been previously established on tumour histology images, but without any direct performance comparison. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the prognostic power of the monofractal, multifractal and co-occurrence algorithms on the same set of images. The investigation was retrospective, with 51 patients selected on account of non-metastatic IBC diagnosis, stage IIIB. Image analysis was performed on digital images of primary tumour tissue sections stained with haematoxylin/eosin. Bootstrap-corrected Cox proportional hazards regression P-values indicated a significant association with metastasis outcome of at least one of the features within each group. AUC values were far better for co-occurrence (0.66-0.77) then for fractal features (0.60-0.64). Correction by the split-sample cross-validation likewise indicated the generalizability only for the co-occurrence features, with their classification accuracies ranging between 67 and 72 %, while accuracies of monofractal and multifractal features were reduced to nearly random 52-55 %. These findings indicate for the first time that the prognostic value of texture analysis of tumour histology is less dependent on the morphological complexity of the image as measured by fractal analysis, but predominantly on the spatial distribution of the gray pixel intensities as calculated by the co-occurrence features."

Epub 2016 Jul 18.,Piccinini F,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2016,2016/09/03,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.07.024,"BACKGROUND: Cancer multicellular spheroids are commonly used as 3D tumour models for testing drugs and radiotherapy treatments. The volume plays a key role in analysis of the results. Several methods have been proposed in the literature to compute the spheroid's volume from one 2D microscopy image (i.e. a single projection). However, the literature lacks reviews summarising the different methods available. Furthermore, there are no well-established approaches by which to compare the different methods and determine the best one. OBJECTIVE: In this work we (a) revise the existing single-image based methods used to estimate the volume of multicellular spheroids, also providing different implementations for classical spherical and ellipsoidal pre-defined models; (b) present an upgrade of a volume estimation software recently proposed, Reconstruction and Visualization from a Single Projection (ReViSP), just validated by using four real spheroids imaged in 3D with a light-sheet microscope; (c) propose a quality assessing approach for single-image based methods, relying on 3D home-made macroscopic synthetic models mimicking the shapes of real multicellular spheroids. RESULTS: Seven image-based methods used to estimate the volume of spheroids were compared using six 3D home-made synthetic models. First, the material used to make the synthetic models was characterised to estimate its density. Then, the ground-truth volume of the 3D models was measured by simply weighing them. The volume instances estimated by the different methods were compared with ground truth. ReViSP attained the best result three times out of six and on average. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained proved that (a) different implementations for the classical spherical and ellipsoidal pre-defined models may lead to very different results; (b) ReViSP is the best single-image based method available today to estimate the volume of multicellular spheroids."

Laryngeal sensitivity is crucial for maintaining safe swallowing, thus avoiding silent aspiration. Morphologic description of different receptor types present in larynx vary because of the study of many different species, from mouse to humans. The most commonly sensory structures described in laryngeal mucosa are free nerve endings, taste buds, muscle spindles, glomerular and corpuscular receptors. This study aimed at describing the morphology and the distribution of nerve endings in premature newborn glottic region. Transversal serial frozen sections of the whole vocal folds of three newborns were analyzed using an immuno-histochemical process with a pan-neuronal marker anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Imaging was done using a confocal laser microscope. Nerve fiber density in vocal cord was calculated using panoramic images in software Morphometric Analysis System v1.0. Some sensory structures, i.e. glomerular endings and intraepithelial free nerve endings were found in the vocal cord mucosa. Muscle spindles, complex nerve endings (Meissner-like, spherical, rectangular and growing) spiral-wharves nerve structures were identified in larynx intrinsic muscles. Nervous total mean density in vocal cord was similar in the three newborns, although they had different gestational age. The mean nerve fiber density was higher in the posterior region than anterior region of vocal cord. The present results demonstrate the occurrence of different morphotypes of sensory corpuscles and nerve endings premature newborn glottic region and provide information on their sensory systems."

The consistently improving quality of ultrasound technology has made it possible to visualize them, which has led to difficulty in distinguishing them from neoplastic liver alterations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the appearance of biliary microhamartomas and their behavior on contrast-enhanced sonography. METHODS: We defined typical sonographic findings in biliary microhamartomas of the liver (1 main criterion and 3 secondary criteria). Nineteen patients were identified as have typical characteristics images of biliary microhamartomas as coincidental findings on liver sonography. All patients were included in a clinical follow-up program without histologic confirmation after they underwent risk assessment. Follow-up examinations were performed with B-mode sonographic examinations at 6, 12, and 18 months. In addition, in 15 patients, contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations of the liver were performed. RESULTS: None of the patients had a change in the number or size of the identifiable typical liver lesions (main criterion) after a mean follow-up period +/- SD of 14.4 +/- 6.5 months. There were also no alterations among the aforementioned secondary criteria in any of the participants. On contrast-enhanced sonography, the lesions of all patients showed a consistent pattern, with early arterial enrichment and persistent homogeneous contrast in the late portal venous phase. CONCLUSIONS: The sonographic appearance of biliary microhamartomas is characteristic and typical enough that histologic confirmation is not always necessary. Follow-up examinations to monitor any developments are usually adequate."

However, locating captured cells in the device by manual counting bottlenecks data processing by being tedious (hours per sample) and compromises the results by being inconsistent and prone to user bias. Some recent work has been done to automate the cell location and classification process to address these problems, employing image processing and machine learning (ML) algorithms to locate and classify cells in fluorescent microscope images. However, the type of machine learning method used is a part of the design space that has not been thoroughly explored. Thus, we have trained four ML algorithms on three different datasets. The trained ML algorithms locate and classify thousands of possible cells in a few minutes rather than a few hours, representing an order of magnitude increase in processing speed. Furthermore, some algorithms have a significantly (P < 0.05) higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than do other algorithms. Additionally, significant (P < 0.05) losses to performance occur when training on cell lines and testing on CTCs (and vice versa), indicating the need to train on a system that is representative of future unlabeled data. Optimal algorithm selection depends on the peculiarities of the individual dataset, indicating the need of a careful comparison and optimization of algorithms for individual image classification tasks.

In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of Raman imaging microscopy to discriminate between healthy and neoplastic thyroid tissue, by analyzing main variants of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC), the most common type of thyroid cancer. We performed Raman imaging of large tissue areas (from 100 x 100 mum(2) up to 1 x 1 mm(2)), collecting 38 maps containing about 9000 Raman spectra. Multivariate statistical methods, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), were applied to translate Raman spectra differences between healthy and PTC tissues into diagnostically useful information for a reliable tissue classification. Our study is the first demonstration of specific biochemical features of the PTC profile, characterized by significant presence of carotenoids with respect to the healthy tissue. Moreover, this is the first evidence of Raman spectra differentiation between classical and follicular variant of PTC, discriminated by LDA with high efficiency. The combined histological and Raman microscopy analyses allow clear-cut integration of morphological and biochemical observations, with dramatic improvement of efficiency and reliability in the differential diagnosis of neoplastic thyroid nodules, paving the way to integrative findings for tumorigenesis and novel therapeutic strategies."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging follow-up between 2006-2014 after gross-tumor resection of intra-axial WHO II glioma. Axial/Mean/Radial diffusivity maps (AD/MD/RD) were generated from DTI data. ADmin/MDmin/RDmin values were quantified within tumor regions-of-interest generated by two independent readers including tumor contrast-to-noise (CNR). Sensitivity/specificity and area-under-the-curve (AUC) were calculated using receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Inter-reader agreement was assessed (Cohen's kappa). RESULTS: Eighteen patients demonstrated malignant transformation (MT) confirmed in 8/18 by histopathology and in 10/18 through imaging follow-up. Twelve of 18 patients (66.6%) with MT showed diffusion restriction timely coincidental with contrast-enhancement (CE). In the remaining six patients (33.3%), the diffusion restriction preceded the CE. The mean gain in detection time using DTI was (0.8+/-0.5 years, p = 0.028). Compared to MDmin and RDmin, ROC-analysis showed best diagnostic value for ADmin (sensitivity/specificity 94.94%/89.7%, AUC 0.96; p<0.0001) to detect MT. CNR was highest for AD (1.83+/-0.14), compared to MD (1.31+/-0.19; p<0.003) and RD (0.90+/-0.23; p<0.0001). Cohen's Kappa was 0.77 for ADmin, 0.71 for MDmin and 0.65 for RDmin (p<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: MT is detectable at the same time point or earlier compared to T1w-CE by diffusion restriction in diffusion-tensor-derived maps. AD demonstrated highest sensitivity/specificity/tumor-contrast compared to radial or mean diffusivity (= apparent diffusion coefficient) to detect MT."

Region-specific RICS analysis remains very challenging because correlations are always calculated in a square region-of-interest (ROI). In this study, we describe a generalized image correlation spectroscopy algorithm that accepts arbitrarily shaped ROIs. We show that an image series can be cleaned up before arbitrary-region RICS (ARICS) analysis. We demonstrate the power of ARICS by simultaneously measuring molecular mobility in the cell membrane and the cytosol. Mobility near dynamic subcellular structures can be investigated with ARICS by generating a dynamic ROI. Finally, we derive diffusion and concentration pseudo-maps using the ARICS method.

In this paper, we simulate blood flow and oxygen transfer in feto-placental capillaries by converting three-dimensional representations of villous and capillary surfaces, reconstructed from confocal laser scanning microscopy, to finite-element meshes, and calculating values of vascular flow resistance and total oxygen transfer. The relationship between the total oxygen transfer rate and the pressure drop through the capillary is shown to be captured across a wide range of pressure drops by physical scaling laws and an upper bound on the oxygen transfer rate. A regression equation is introduced that can be used to estimate the oxygen transfer in a capillary using the vascular resistance. Two techniques for quantifying the effects of statistical variability, experimental uncertainty and pathological placental structure on the calculated properties are then introduced. First, scaling arguments are used to quantify the sensitivity of the model to uncertainties in the geometry and the parameters. Second, the effects of localized dilations in fetal capillaries are investigated using an idealized axisymmetric model, to quantify the possible effect of pathological placental structure on oxygen transfer. The model predicts how, for a fixed pressure drop through a capillary, oxygen transfer is maximized by an optimal width of the dilation. The results could explain the prevalence of fetal hypoxia in cases of delayed villous maturation, a pathology characterized by a lack of the vasculo-syncytial membranes often seen in conjunction with localized capillary dilations."

Epub 2016 Jun 11.,Tennant SL,Clin Radiol,2016,2016/06/15,,,10.1016/j.crad.2016.05.009,"AIM: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM), and gauge its ""added value"" in the symptomatic setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective multi-reader review of 100 consecutive CESM examinations was performed. Anonymised low-energy (LE) images were reviewed and given a score for malignancy. At least 3 weeks later, the entire examination (LE and recombined images) was reviewed. Histopathology data were obtained for all cases. Differences in performance were assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and lesion size (versus MRI or histopathology) differences were calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-three percent of cases were malignant at final histology, 27% were benign following standard triple assessment. ROC analysis showed improved overall performance of CESM over LE alone, with area under the curve of 0.93 versus 0.83 (p<0.025). CESM showed increased sensitivity (95% versus 84%, p<0.025) and specificity (81% versus 63%, p<0.025) compared to LE alone, with all five readers showing improved accuracy. Tumour size estimation at CESM was significantly more accurate than LE alone, the latter tending to undersize lesions. In 75% of cases, CESM was deemed a useful or significant aid to diagnosis. CONCLUSION: CESM provides immediately available, clinically useful information in the symptomatic clinic in patients with suspicious palpable abnormalities. Radiologist sensitivity, specificity, and size accuracy for breast cancer detection and staging are all improved using CESM as the primary mammographic investigation."

Also, within the coronoid and in the condylar processes there are cartilaginous cores, which eventually undergo ossification. Furthermore, there are a number of additional single cartilaginous islets arising in fetuses of 95mm CRL and more. They are located predominantly within the bone at the buccal sides of the brims of the dental compartments, mostly in the gussets between the dental primordia. They become wedge-shaped or elongated with a diameter of around 150-500mum and were also found in older stages up to 225mm CRL, which was the oldest specimen used in this study. This report is intended to visualize these single cartilaginous islets histologically and in 3-D reconstructions in stereoscopic images. Although some singular cartilaginous tissue within the mandible may be remains of the decaying Meckel's cartilage, our 3-D reconstructions clearly show that the aforementioned cartilaginous islets are independent thereof, as can be derived from their separate locations within the mandibular bone. The reasons that lead to these cartilaginous formations have remained unknown so far."

In this paper, we present a new bioimage classification method that can be generally applicable to a wide variety of classification problems. We propose to use a high-dimensional multi-modal descriptor that combines multiple texture features. We also design a novel subcategory discriminant transform (SDT) algorithm to further enhance the discriminative power of descriptors by learning convolution kernels to reduce the within-class variation and increase the between-class difference. RESULTS: We evaluate our method on eight different bioimage classification tasks using the publicly available IICBU 2008 database. Each task comprises a separate dataset, and the collection represents typical subcellular, cellular, and tissue level classification problems. Our method demonstrates improved classification accuracy (0.9 to 9%) on six tasks when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We also find that SDT outperforms the well-known dimension reduction techniques, with for example 0.2 to 13% improvement over linear discriminant analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We present a general bioimage classification method, which comprises a highly descriptive visual feature representation and a learning-based discriminative feature transformation algorithm. Our evaluation on the IICBU 2008 database demonstrates improved performance over the state-of-the-art for six different classification tasks."

RESULTS: According to Edmondson-Steiner grade lesions were classified with grade 1 (14), grade 2 (30), grade 3 (18), and grade 4 (0). Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), perfusion fraction (fp), tissue diffusion coefficient (Dt) median values were statistically different in HCC groups with 1, 2, 3 histological grade (p<0.001). A significant correlation was reported between ADC, fp, Dt and histologic grade respectively of 0.687, 0.737 and 0.674. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that an ADC of 2.11x10-3 mm2/sec, an fp of 47.33% and an Dt of 0.94x10-3 mm2/sec were the optimal cutoff values to differentiate high histological grade (3) versus low histological grade (1-2), with a sensitivity and specificity for ADC of 100% and 100%, for fp of 100% and 89%, for Dt of 100% and 74%, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective approved study was performed including 34 patients with 62 HCCs. IVIM was performed to obtain ADC, fp, pseudo-diffusion coefficient (Dp), Dt coefficients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective study included 93 patients with 101 pathologically proven thyroid nodules. All patients underwent preoperative r-FOV DWI at 3T. The whole-lesion ADC assessments were performed for each patient. Histogram-derived ADC parameters between different subgroups (pathologic type, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis) were compared. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine optimal histogram parameters in differentiating benign and malignant nodules and predicting aggressiveness of PTC. RESULTS: Mean ADC, median ADC, 5(th) percentile ADC, 25(th) percentile ADC, 75(th) percentile ADC, 95(th) percentile ADC (all P < 0.001), and kurtosis (P = 0.001) were significantly lower in malignant thyroid nodules, and mean ADC achieved the highest AUC (0.919) with a cutoff value of 1842.78 x 10(-6) mm(2) /s in differentiating malignant and benign nodules. Compared to the PTCs without extrathyroidal extension, PTCs with extrathyroidal extension showed significantly lower median ADC, 5(th) percentile ADC, and 25(th) percentile ADC. The 5(th) percentile ADC achieved the highest AUC (0.757) with cutoff value of 911.5 x 10(-6) mm(2) /s for differentiating between PTCs with and without extrathyroidal extension.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of 241 patients with HCC confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent preoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on a 1.5T MRI scanner. The mean and minimum ADC values of the tumors were measured. The ADC values were compared in tumors with different grades and the correlations between ADC values and pathological grade were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of ADC values were obtained and compared to distinguish poorly and nonpoorly differentiated HCCs. Interobserver agreements were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: The mean and minimum ADC values of poorly differentiated HCCs were lower than those of nonpoorly differentiated HCCs (P = 0.000, 0.000, respectively). The mean and minimum ADC values were negatively correlated with pathological grade (r(s) = -0.180 and -0.202, respectively) (P = 0.005, 0.002, respectively). For the differentiation between poorly and nonpoorly differentiated HCCs, the mean ADC value provided a sensitivity of 69.57% and a specificity of 73.39% with a cutoff value of 0.96 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s while the minimum ADC value showed a sensitivity of 78.26% and a specificity of 61.47% with a cutoff value of 0.90 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s. No significant difference existed between both ROC curves (P = 0.64). The ICC for the measurements of the mean and minimum ADC values was 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.89-0.93), respectively.

Epub 2016 Oct 3.,Bocaege E,Am J Phys Anthropol,2016,2016/10/04,,,10.1002/ajpa.23070,"OBJECTIVES: The investigation of the record of growth locked in dental enamel provides a unique opportunity to build a comprehensive picture of growth disruption episodes during childhood. This study presents a new methodological basis for the analysis of enamel growth disruptions (enamel hypoplasia) using incremental microstructures of enamel. METHODS: A three-dimensional technique based upon use of an Alicona 3D Infinite Focus imaging microscope and software is used to record developmental features in the enamel of human permanent mandibular lateral incisors of one individual from the Neolithic site of Catalhoyuk (Turkey). Using this new technique, perikymata are measured down the longitudinal axis of the crown from the incisal margin to the cervix and perikyma spacing profiles are constructed with this new technique. A mathematical basis for the detection of spacing anomalies, which serve as indicators of enamel hypoplasia is presented based upon these profiles. RESULTS: Three clearly delineated defects were identified visually, then matched and confirmed metrically using the enamel surface and perikyma spacing profiles. DISCUSSION: Human growth has often been used as an indicator of health in past societies because of developmental sensitivity to fluctuations in nutritional status and disease load. Hence, standardization of furrow-form defect identification is of crucial importance for reducing the amount of current subjectivity in the determination of a threshold for the identification of defects among individuals of past populations. The method presented here, which is based on microscopic images of the tooth crown as well as recorded measurements of incremental structures, represents a combined visual-metric approach using LOWESS residuals, and as such provides a substantial advancement to previous methods. It is therefore recommended that additional studies be carried out with this methodology to determine whether this method improves the reliability of enamel defect identification among individuals recovered from bioarchaeological contexts."

METHODS: IRB approval was obtained for this retrospective study. We selected 150 FFDM and DBT (50 benign and 50 malignant histologically verified microcalcifications, 50 cases classified as BI-RADS 1). Four radiologists evaluated, in separate sessions and blinded to patients' history and histology, the presence of microcalcifications. Cases with microcalcifications were assessed for visibility, characteristics, and grade of suspicion using BI-RADS categories. Detection rate and diagnostic performance were calculated. Visibility, lesions' characteristics and reading time were analysed. RESULTS: Detection rate and visibility were good for both FFDM and DBT, without intra-reader differences (P=0.510). Inter-reader differences were detected (P<0.018). Only two lesions were not detected by any reader on either FFDM or DBT. Diagnostic performance with DBT was as good as that of FFDM, but a significant inter-reader difference was found (P=0.041). High inter-reader variability in the use of the descriptors was found. Reading time for DBT was almost twice that for FFDM (44 and 25s, respectively). CONCLUSION: Wide scan-angle DBT enabled the detection and characterization of microcalcifications with no significant differences from FFDM. Inter-reader variability was seen."

In Liverpool, post-mortem room angiography is undertaken, followed by complete removal of the vertebral arteries and histological examination. It has been observed that the arterial anatomy can be highly variable, particularly the length and course of the loop segments located between the C2 vertebra and the dura. In a number of cases of TBSAH the loop segments of torn vessels have appeared relatively short. Having observed this phenomenon subjectively in our case work, a radiological study was undertaken with the aim of quantifying vertebral artery loop anatomy variation in a 'normal' population. Multiphase post-mortem computed tomography angiography (MPMCTA) scans of 98 subjects were reviewed and the lengths of the different portions of the loop segments (foramen magnum to the upper border of C1, between C1 and C2, and the bony foramina themselves) of each vertebral artery were measured using semi-automated vessel analysis software. The measurements obtained provide objective evidence of marked anatomical variation, with some loop segments more than twice the length of others. These results are important because a short vertebral artery loop segment might be a significant factor in predisposing an individual to TBSAH following a blow to the head or neck."

We describe the theory behind XDFI, the X-ray optics required for implementing it in practice, and algorithms used for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D image reconstruction. The XDFI optical chain consists of an asymmetrically cut, Bragg-type monochromator-collimator that provides a planar monochromatic X-ray beam, a positioning stage for the specimens, a Laue-case angle analyzer, and one or two cameras to capture the dark and bright field images. We demonstrate the soft-tissue discrimination capabilities of XDFI by reconstructing images with absorption and phase contrast. By using a variety of specimens such as breast tissue with cancer, joints with articular cartilage, ex-vivo human eye specimen, and others, we show that refraction-based contrast derived from XDFI is more effective in characterizing anatomical features, articular pathology, and neoplastic disease than conventional absorption-based images. For example, XDFI of breast tissue can discriminate between the normal and diseased terminal duct lobular unit, and between invasive and in-situ cancer. The final section of this paper is devoted to potential future developments to enable clinical and histo-pathological applications of this technique."

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has great potential in this field to visualize drug distribution in organs and tumor tissues with good spatial resolution and superior specificity. We present an accurate and reproducible imaging method to investigate the variation of drug distribution in different parts of solid tumors. The method was applied to study the distribution of paclitaxel in three ovarian cancer models with different histopathological characteristics and in colon cancer (HCT116), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM487). The heterogeneous drug penetration in the tumors is evident from the MALDI imaging results and from the images analysis. The differences between the various models do not always relate to significant changes in drug content in tumor homogenate examined by classical HPLC analysis. The specificity of the method clarifies the heterogeneity of the drug distribution that is analyzed from a quantitative point of view too, highlighting how marked are the variations of paclitaxel amounts in different part of solid tumors."

In a typical microscopic specimen, the foreground objects may lie on different depths of field necessitating capture of multiple images taken at different focal planes. The extended depth of field (EDoF) technique is a computational method for merging images from different depths of field into a composite image with all foreground objects in focus. Composite images generated by EDoF can be applied in automated image processing and pattern recognition systems. However, current algorithms for EDoF are computationally intensive and impractical, especially for applications such as medical diagnosis where rapid sample turnaround is important. Since foreground objects typically constitute a minor part of an image, the EDoF technique could be made to work much faster if only foreground regions are processed to make the composite image. We propose a novel algorithm called object-based extended depths of field (OEDoF) to address this issue. METHODS: The OEDoF algorithm consists of four major modules: 1) color conversion, 2) object region identification, 3) good contrast pixel identification and 4) detail merging. First, the algorithm employs color conversion to enhance contrast followed by identification of foreground pixels. A composite image is constructed using only these foreground pixels, which dramatically reduces the computational time. RESULTS: We used 250 images obtained from 45 specimens of confirmed malaria infections to test our proposed algorithm. The resulting composite images with all in-focus objects were produced using the proposed OEDoF algorithm. We measured the performance of OEDoF in terms of image clarity (quality) and processing time. The features of interest selected by the OEDoF algorithm are comparable in quality with equivalent regions in images processed by the state-of-the-art complex wavelet EDoF algorithm; however, OEDoF required four times less processing time. CONCLUSIONS: This work presents a modification of the extended depth of field approach for efficiently enhancing microscopic images. This selective object processing scheme used in OEDoF can significantly reduce the overall processing time while maintaining the clarity of important image features. The empirical results from parasite-infected red cell images revealed that our proposed method efficiently and effectively produced in-focus composite images. With the speed improvement of OEDoF, this proposed algorithm is suitable for processing large numbers of microscope images, e.g., as required for medical diagnosis."

Epub 2016 Jan 17.,Thomen RP,Magn Reson Med,2017,2016/01/19,,,10.1002/mrm.26120,"PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an irreversible lung disease characterized by small-airway obstruction and alveolar-airspace destruction. Hyperpolarized (129) Xe diffusion MRI of lung is a promising biomarker for assessing airspace enlargement, but has yet to be validated by direct comparison to lung histology. Here we have compared diffusion measurements of hyperpolarized (HP) (129) Xe in explanted lungs to regionally matched morphological measures of airspace size. METHODS: Explanted lungs from five COPD patients and two idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients were imaged using MRI with hyperpolarized (129) Xe using a two-b-value gradient-echo diffusion sequence, and 34 histological samples were taken from these lungs for quantitative histology. Mean-linear-intercept (L(m) ) was compared with spatially matched measures of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from (129) Xe MRI. RESULTS: The mean ADC from COPD lung samples was 0.071 +/- 0.011 cm(2) /s, and for IPF lungs was 0.033 +/- 0.001 cm(2) /s (P < 10(-15) between groups). The mean L(m) in COPD samples was 0.076 +/- 0.027 cm and 0.041 +/- 0.004 cm in IPF (P = 2.7 x 10(-7) between groups). The Pearson-correlation between ADC and L(m) measurements was r = 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion MRI of HP (129) Xe quantifies regional airspace enlargement in COPD. (129) Xe ADC showed much less overlap between groups than quantitative histology, consistent with our past experience with (3) He diffusion MRI in COPD. Magn Reson Med 77:265-272, 2017.

Epub 2016 Jul 25.,Li H,J Prosthet Dent,2017,2016/07/28,,,10.1016/j.prosdent.2016.04.008,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Limited information is available regarding the influence of object translucency on the scanning accuracy of a powder-free intraoral scanner. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the scanning accuracy of a confocal microscopy principle powder-free intraoral scanner on ceramic copings and to analyze the relationship between scanning accuracy and object translucency. METHODS: Six slice specimens (12x10 mm) and 6 offset copings (1.00-mm thickness) were made from different translucent homogeneous ceramic blocks (CEREC Blocs, S0-M to S5-M, highest to lowest translucency). The primary sintered zirconia offset coping was produced in the same way as the control. Optical parameters related to the translucency of each slice were measured with a spectrophotometer. Three-dimensional (3D) datasets of the surface morphology of offset copings were obtained by using the intraoral scanner. The same white wax resin bases were used for registration. Quantitative parameters of scanning trueness and precision were measured. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the values of each parameter among the 6 ceramic blocks. Bivariate correlation was used to analyze the relationships between each parameter of scanning accuracy and translucency (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Translucent copings showed a positive 3D bias (S0-M to S5-M: 0.149 +/-0.038 mm to 0.068 +/-0.020 mm), a narrower collar diameter (Dd=-0.067 mm), larger convergence angle (DeltaPhi=2.79 degrees), and larger curvature radius of the internal gingivoaxial corner (Deltarho=0.236 mm). The smaller the percentage sum of scattering and absorption, the greater was the occurrence of scanning bias (r=-0.918) and curvature (r=-0.935) decrease. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the tested powder-free intraoral scanner, higher translucency objects (greater translucency than S1-M/A1C) resulted in lower scanning accuracy and morphological changes. Therefore, more suitable methods of measurement are still required."
27494805,Feature-based multi-resolution registration of immunostained serial sections,"Lobachev O, Ulrich C, Steiniger BS, Wilhelmi V, Stachniss V, Guthe M.",Med Image Anal. 2017 Jan;35:288-302. doi: 10.1016/j.media.2016.07.010. Epub 2016 Jul 25.,Lobachev O,Med Image Anal,2017,2016/08/06,,,10.1016/j.media.2016.07.010,"The form and exact function of the blood vessel network in some human organs, like spleen and bone marrow, are still open research questions in medicine. In this paper, we propose a method to register the immunohistological stainings of serial sections of spleen and bone marrow specimens to enable the visualization and visual inspection of blood vessels. As these vary much in caliber, from mesoscopic (millimeter-range) to microscopic (few micrometers, comparable to a single erythrocyte), we need to utilize a multi-resolution approach. Our method is fully automatic; it is based on feature detection and sparse matching. We utilize a rigid alignment and then a non-rigid deformation, iteratively dealing with increasingly smaller features. Our tool pipeline can already deal with series of complete scans at extremely high resolution, up to 620 megapixels. The improvement presented increases the range of represented details up to smallest capillaries. This paper provides details on the multi-resolution non-rigid registration approach we use. Our application is novel in the way the alignment and subsequent deformations are computed (using features, i.e. ""sparse""). The deformations are based on all images in the stack (""global""). We also present volume renderings and a 3D reconstruction of the vascular network in human spleen and bone marrow on a level not possible before. Our registration makes easy tracking of even smallest blood vessels possible, thus granting experts a better comprehension. A quantitative evaluation of our method and related state of the art approaches with seven different quality measures shows the efficiency of our method. We also provide z-profiles and enlarged volume renderings from three different registrations for visual inspection."

Epub 2016 Aug 28.,Chen Z,Magn Reson Imaging,2017,2016/11/07,,,10.1016/j.mri.2016.08.013,"Passband balanced steady state free precession (b-SSFP) fMRI employs the flat portion of the SSFP off-resonance response to obtain microscopic susceptibility changes elicited by changes in blood oxygenation following enhancement in neuronal activity. This technique can reduce geometric distortion and signal dropout while maintaining rapid acquisition and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with traditional fMRI techniques. In the study, we developed a novel multi-phase passband b-SSFP fMRI technique that can achieve a spatial resolution of a few mm(3) and a high temporal sampling rate of 50ms per slice at 7Tesla. This technique was further applied for an event-related (ER) fMRI paradigm. As a comparison, gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) with similar spatial resolution and temporal sampling rate was carried out for the same ER-fMRI experiment. Experiments with visual cortex stimulation were carried out at 7Tesla to demonstrate whether the multi-phase b-SSFP technique and GE-EPI are able to differentiate temporal delays in hemodynamic response function (HRF) separated by 100ms in stimulus onset. Consistent with ERP results, the upslope of the HRF of both techniques can differentiate 100ms delay in stimulus onset, with the former showing a lower level of intersubject variability. The present study demonstrated that the multi-phase passband b-SSFP fMRI technique can be applied for resolving neuronal events on the order of 100ms at ultrahigh magnetic fields."

Epub 2016 Sep 7.,Hempel JM,J Neurooncol,2017,2016/09/09,,,10.1007/s11060-016-2272-0,"The purpose of this study is to assess the diagnostic performance of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) for in vivo molecular profiling of human glioma. Normalized mean kurtosis (MK(n)) and mean diffusivity (MD(n)) metrics from DKI were assessed in 50 patients with histopathologically confirmed glioma. The results were compared in regard to the WHO-based histological findings and molecular characteristics leading to integrated diagnosis (Haarlem Consensus): isocitrate-dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) mutation status, alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) expression, chromosome 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. MK(n) was significantly lower in tumors with IDH1/2 mutation (0.43 +/- 0.09) and ATRX loss of expression (0.41 +/- 0.11) than in those with IDH1/2 wild type (0.57 +/- 0.09, p < 0.001) and ATRX maintained expression (0.51 +/- 0.10, p = 0.004), respectively. Regarding the integrated molecular diagnosis, MK(n) was significantly higher in primary glioblastoma (0.57 +/- 0.10) than in astrocytoma (0.39 +/- 0.11, p < 0.001) and oligodendroglioma (0.47 +/- 0.05, p = 0.003). MK may be used to provide insight into the human glioma molecular profile regarding IDH1/2 mutation status and ATRX expression. Considering the diagnostic and prognostic significance of these molecular markers, MK appears to be a promising in vivo biomarker for glioma. The diagnostic performance of MK seems to fit more with the integrated molecular approach than the conventional histological findings of the current WHO 2007 classification."

Epub 2016 Oct 4.,Leonidakis KA,Acta Biomater,2017,2016/10/09,,,10.1016/j.actbio.2016.09.044,"Fibrin hydrogels are promising carrier materials in tissue engineering. They are biocompatible and easy to prepare, they can bind growth factors and they can be prepared from a patient's own blood. While fibrin structure and mechanics have been extensively studied, not much is known about the relation between structure and diffusivity of solutes within the network. This is particularly relevant for solutes with a size similar to that of growth factors. A novel methodological approach has been used in this study to retrieve quantitative structural characteristics of fibrin hydrogels, by combining two complementary techniques, namely confocal fluorescence microscopy with a fiber extraction algorithm and turbidity measurements. Bulk rheological measurements were conducted to determine the impact of fibrin hydrogel structure on mechanical properties. From these measurements it can be concluded that variations in the fibrin hydrogel structure have a large impact on the rheological response of the hydrogels (up to two orders of magnitude difference in storage modulus) but only a moderate influence on the diffusivity of dextran solutes (up to 25% difference). By analyzing the diffusivity measurements by means of the Ogston diffusion model we further provide evidence that individual fibrin fibers can be semi-permeable to solute transport, depending on the average distance between individual protofibrils. This can be important for reducing mass transport limitations, for modulating fibrinolysis and for growth factor binding, which are all relevant for tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Fibrin is a natural biopolymer that has drawn much interest as a biomimetic carrier in tissue engineering applications. We hereby use a novel combined approach for the structural characterization of fibrin networks based on optical microscopy and light scattering methods that can also be applied to other fibrillar hydrogels, like collagen. Furthermore, our findings on the relation between solute transport and fibrin structural properties can lead to the optimized design of fibrin hydrogel constructs for controlled release applications. Finally, we provide new evidence for the fact that fibrin fibers may be permeable for solutes with a molecular weight comparable to that of growth factors. This finding may open new avenues for tailoring mass transport properties of fibrin carriers."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were unselected women aged 50-69 years recalled within a population-based European breast screening programme for assessment of soft-tissue mammographic abnormalities. Supplementary mammographic views (SMVs) and DBT were performed in all cases. A range of equipment was used for screening and supplementary mammography, but all DBT examinations were performed using the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration. A retrospective multi-reader study including 238 cases for whom either histology or at least 2 years' follow-up was available was performed with eight suitably accredited UK breast screening personnel reading all cases under both conditions, with temporal separation. Readers were blinded to case outcomes and findings from other examinations. Diagnostic accuracy using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was compared between screening plus SMV images and screening plus DBT images. The study was powered to detect a 3% inferiority margin in diagnostic accuracy between methods. RESULTS: The final sample with complete data available for analysis included 195 benign cases (1,560 reads) and 35 malignant cases (280 reads). The DBT method yielded a slightly higher area under the curve (AUC) value than the SMV method (0.870 versus 0.857), but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.4890), indicating that the methods have equivalent accuracy. CONCLUSION: Siemens DBT demonstrates equivalent diagnostic accuracy according to ROC curve analysis when used in place of SMVs in screen-detected soft-tissue mammographic abnormalities."

In the present study, we have analyzed the possible alterations of GA in neurons from the temporal neocortex and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, using double immunofluorescence techniques, confocal microscopy and 3D quantification techniques. We found that in AD patients, the percentage of temporal neocortical and CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons with a highly altered GA is much higher (approximately 65%) in neurons with neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) than in NFT-free neurons (approximately 6%). Quantitative analysis of the surface area and volume of GA elements in neurons revealed that, compared with NFT-free neurons, NFT-bearing neurons had a reduction of approximately one half in neocortical neurons and one third in CA1 neurons. In both regions, neurons with a pre-tangle stage of phospho-tau accumulation had surface area and GA volume values that were intermediate, that is, between those of NFT-free and NFT-bearing neurons. These findings support the idea that the progressive accumulation of phospho-tau is associated with structural alterations of the GA including fragmentation and a decrease in the surface area and volume of GA elements. These alterations likely impact the processing and trafficking of proteins, which might contribute to neuronal dysfunction in AD."

Measurable properties of the phagosomal lumen include: assessment of various hydrolytic activities, reduction and oxidation events, pH, ion concentrations, and electrochemical gradients. These often-interdependent phagosomal features are commonly evaluated individually, hindering the analysis of the biochemical relationship between these factors within the same phagosome. In addition, the ability of phagosomes within the same cell to behave autonomously is becoming more evident, thus highlighting the need for a technique capable of multiplex analyses of phagosomal lumenal chemistries at the single phagosome level. In this chapter, we outline an approach that is capable of simultaneously measuring multiple phagosomal parameters of individual phagosomes by utilizing specifically designed experimental particles with multiple reporter fluors, in combination with real-time fluorometric measurement via automated microscopy. Subsequent analysis using high-content image analysis software enables each phagosomal parameter to be evaluated in a quantitative or semi-quantitative manner. This approach facilitates investigation of the complex relationship between phagosomal properties in a population of macrophages in real time, at the level of individual phagosomes."

It also makes it difficult to assess the importance of individual bacterial phenotypes, especially when there are only subtle differences in features such as shape, size, or signal intensity, which is typically very difficult for the human eye to discern. With computer vision-based image analysis - where computer algorithms interpret image data - it is possible to achieve an objective and reproducible quantification of images in an automated fashion. Besides being a much more efficient and consistent way to analyze images, this can also reveal important information that was previously hard to extract with traditional methods. Here, we present basic concepts of automated image processing, segmentation and analysis that can be relatively easy implemented for use with bacterial research."

An understanding of their function and regulation is only possible with the knowledge of the spatiotemporal dynamics of their proteins. Mitochondrial membrane proteins involved in diverse functions like protein import, cell respiration, metabolite transport, and mitochondrial morphology are mobile within membranes. Here, we provide a protocol for a superresolution fluorescence microscopy technique named tracking and localization microscopy (TALM) that allows for localization and diffusion analysis of single mitochondrial membrane proteins in situ in cell cultures. This noninvasive imaging technique is a useful tool to reveal the spatiotemporal organization of proteins in diverse mitochondrial membrane compartments in living cells. Proteins of interest are tagged with the HaloTag((R)) and specifically labeled with functionalized rhodamine dyes. The method profits from low abundance of proteins and therefore works better with substoichiometric labeling of HaloTag(R)-tagged proteins. In particular, the use of photostable bright rhodamine dyes enables the specific tagging and localization of single molecules with a calculated precision below 20 nm and the recording of single trajectories."

This paper proposes a concave-convex variation (CCV) method to optimize three classifiers (random forest, support vector machine, and extreme learning machine) for the more accurate HCC image classification results. First, in preprocessing stage, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) pathological images are enhanced using bilateral filter and each HCC image patch is obtained under the guidance of pathologists. Then, after extracting the complete features of each patch, a new sparse contribution (SC) feature selection model is established to select the beneficial features for each classifier. Finally, a concave-convex variation method is developed to improve the performance of classifiers. Experiments using 1260 HCC image patches demonstrate that our proposed CCV classifiers have improved greatly compared to each original classifier and CCV-random forest (CCV-RF) performs the best for HCC image recognition."

However, since cell deformation induced by various biological processes is random and cell protrusion is irregular, it is difficult to measure cell morphology and motility in microscopic images. To address this dilemma, we propose an improved variation optical flow model for quantitative analysis of intracellular motility, which not only extracts intracellular motion fields effectively but also deals with optical flow computation problem at the border by taking advantages of the formulation based on L(1) and L(2) norm, respectively. In the energy functional of our proposed optical flow model, the data term is in the form of L(2) norm; the smoothness of the data changes with regional features through an adaptive parameter, using L(1) norm near the edge of the cell and L(2) norm away from the edge. We further extract histograms of oriented optical flow (HOOF) after optical flow field of intracellular motion is computed. Then distances of different HOOFs are calculated as the intracellular motion features to grade the intracellular motion. Experimental results show that the features extracted from HOOFs provide new insights into the relationship between the cell motility and the special pathological conditions."

After dehydration they form dry residue particles (DRPs). As a first step in developing techniques to characterize individual DRPs, a new electrostatic collector was designed in which DRPs are charged within a unipolar corona charger, concentrated in a cone funnel, and deposited onto a limited area of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface. The collector captures 80%-90% of DRPs at an optimal flow rate of 0.15 l min(-1). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed flattened round particles 20-50 nm high, with notable protrusions at their surface suggestive of an inhomogeneous internal structure. Exposure to humid air resulted in the DRPs spreading over the surface, with a 50%-200% decrease in their heights and an increase in their lateral dimensions so that their volume decreased by only 10% +/- 3%. Exposure to saturated chloroform vapor resulted in drainage of 10%-15% of the DRP volume (presumably lipids), forming collar-shaped rings around each particle but leaving the core size and structure unchanged. AFM measurements combined with laser counter measurements of the DRP concentrations were used to estimate that one liter of air exhaled by volunteers contained less than 100 pg of dry residue material."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with gastric cancer were enrolled in a retrospective 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. ADC maps were obtained at two different b values (0 and 1000 sec/mm(2) ) for each patient. Tumors were delineated on each slice of the ADC maps, and a histogram for the entire tumor volume was subsequently generated. A series of histogram parameters (eg, skew and kurtosis) were calculated and correlated with the histological grade of the surgical specimen. The diagnostic performance of each parameter for distinguishing poorly from moderately well-differentiated gastric cancers was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: There were significant differences in the 5(th) , 10(th) , 25(th) , and 50(th) percentiles, skew, and kurtosis between poorly and well-differentiated gastric cancers (P < 0.05). There were correlations between the degrees of differentiation and histogram parameters, including the 10(th) percentile, skew, kurtosis, and max frequency; the correlation coefficients were 0.273, -0.361, -0.339, and -0.370, respectively. Among all the histogram parameters, the max frequency had the largest AUC value, which was 0.675. CONCLUSION: Histogram analysis of the ADC maps on the basis of the entire tumor volume can be useful in differentiating between histological grades for gastric cancer. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 J. Magn.

State-of-the art automatic methods however still fail to provide the segmentation quality achievable by humans who employ expert knowledge and use software to mark target structures on an image. Manual segmentation is time-consuming, tedious and suffers from interoperator variability, thus not serving the requirements of daily use well. Therefore, the approach presented here abandons the goal of full-fledged segmentation and settles for the localization of circular objects in photographs (10 training images and 20 testing images with several hundreds of nuclei each). A fully trainable softcore interaction point process model was hence fit to the most likely locations of nuclei of meningioma cells. The Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection/SIMCEP data set of virtual cells served as controls. A 'colour deconvolution' algorithm was integrated to determine (based on anti-Ki67 immunohistochemistry) which real cells might have the potential to proliferate. In addition, a density parameter of the underlying Bayesian model was estimated. Immunohistochemistry results were 'simulated'for the virtual cells. The system yielded true positive (TP) rates in the detection and classification of real nuclei and their virtual counterparts. These hits outnumbered those obtained from the public domain image processing software ImageJ by 10%. The method introduced here can be trained to function not only in medicine and morphology-based systems biology but in other application domains as well. The algorithm lends itself to an automated approach that constitutes a valuable tool which is easy to use and generates acceptable results quickly."

The significant lack of bone in the alveolar ridges may compromise the final restorations both from the aesthetic and functional standpoints. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the behavior of bone block allografts for the maxillary augmentation and to investigate its incorporation, remodeling, and implant survival rates in two different healing time points. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients (52 female/14 male, mean age: 57.95 +/- 9.06 years old), presenting 113 atrophic alveolar ridges underwent maxillary augmentation with fresh-frozen allogeneic bone blocks from tibia. Patients were randomly assigned in two groups: Group 1-patients who would wait 4 months for implant placement after grafting, and Group 2-patients who would wait 6 months. Events of infection, suture dehiscence or mucosal perforation were recorded. Cone-beam computed tomography scans were compared volumetrically between the time of the grafting surgery and reentry procedure after incorporation. Biopsies were collected and subjected to histological, histomorphometric and immunehistochemical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 305 implants were placed in the reconstructed sites. The mean resorption rate in Group 1 (13.98% +/- 5.59) was significantly lower than Group 2 (31.52% +/- 6.31). The amount of calcified tissue, newly formed bone and remaining graft particles demonstrated no difference between groups. The samples showed evident immunolabeling for the podoplanin protein in both groups. The implants cumulative survival rate was 94.76%. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study indicate that there is a significant difference regarding the resorption of the grafts when waiting 4 or 6 months before placing the implants, even though no difference was found in the histological, histomorphometric, and immunohistochemical features. Both 4-month and 6-months healing times are suitable for the implant placement."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients (13 male and 10 female patients) diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis on the basis of clinical features and findings from imaging, bronchoscopy, and pathologic analysis were retrospectively evaluated. All patients underwent pulmonary MDCT after direct lymphangiography, surgical operation or open lung biopsy, and histopathologic examination. MDCT images were analyzed by two experienced radiologists independently. RESULTS: MDCT after direct lymphangiography revealed numerous intrathoracic abnormalities, including abnormal distribution of contrast medium, dilatation of lymphatic channels, mediastinal soft-tissue infiltration, and peribronchovascular thickening. Nineteen patients had interlobular septal thickening, 18 had diffuse ground-glass opacities, 22 had pleural effusion, 14 had extrapleural soft-tissue thickening, 20 had pericardial effusion and thickened pericardium, 10 had multiple lymphadenopathy in mediastinum, and five had mediastinal, pericardial, and thoracic aeroceles. CONCLUSION: MDCT performed after direct lymphangiography is well suited to clarify the characteristics of intrathoracic disorders and is an excellent tool in the diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with histologically confirmed pNET who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced MDCT were included in this study. Nineteen tumours were classified as Grade 1 (G1) and 20 as Grade 2 (G2). Histopathology slides were reviewed to assess the intratumoural microvascular density (MVD) and the amount of tumour stroma. Computed tomography (CT) image analysis included tumour size, margin delineation, calcifications, homogeneity, contrast enhancement (CE) pattern, tumour absolute and relative enhancement, presence of cystic changes, pancreatic duct dilatation, regional and distant metastases. The diagnostic ability to predict tumour grade was measured for each MDCT finding and their combinations. RESULTS: The mean arterial enhancement ratio had a mean+/-standard deviation of 1.53+/-0.45 in G1 and 1.01+/-0.33 in G2 pNETs (p=0.0003) and correlated with intratumoural microvascular density (MVD; r=0.55, p=0.0002). Tissue stroma percentage did not correlate with imaging findings. Late CE of the tumour (the peak attenuation observed in the venous phase) was significantly associated with G2. Tumour size >20 mm, arterial enhancement ratio <1.1, and late CE showed 74.4%, 79.5%, and 74.4% accuracy, respectively, in diagnosing G2 tumours, while the accuracy of at least two of these criteria used in combination was 82%. Based on these results, a diagnostic algorithm was proposed, which showed high interobserver agreement (k=0.82) in the prediction of tumour grade. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced MDCT features correlate with histological findings and enable the differentiation between G1 and G2 pNETs during preoperative examination."

Epub 2016 Dec 16.,Pomares FB,J Neurosci,2017,2016/12/18,PMC6596849,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2619-16.2016,"Chronic pain patients present with cortical gray matter alterations, observed with anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Reduced regional gray matter volumes are often interpreted to reflect neurodegeneration, but studies investigating the cellular origin of gray matter changes are lacking. We used multimodal imaging to compare 26 postmenopausal women with fibromyalgia with 25 healthy controls (age range: 50-75 years) to test whether regional gray matter volume decreases in chronic pain are associated with compromised neuronal integrity. Regional gray matter decreases were largely explained by T1 relaxation times in gray matter, a surrogate measure of water content, and not to any substantial degree by GABA(A) receptor concentration, an indirect marker of neuronal integrity measured with [(18)F] flumazenil PET. In addition, the MR spectroscopy marker of neuronal viability, N-acetylaspartate, did not differ between patients and controls. These findings suggest that decreased gray matter volumes are not explained by compromised neuronal integrity. Alternatively, a decrease in neuronal matter could be compensated for by an upregulation of GABA(A) receptors. The relation between regional gray matter and T1 relaxation times suggests decreased tissue water content underlying regional gray matter decreases. In contrast, regional gray matter increases were explained by GABA(A) receptor concentration in addition to T1 relaxation times, indicating perhaps increased neuronal matter or GABA(A) receptor upregulation and inflammatory edema. By providing information on the histological origins of cerebral gray matter alterations in fibromyalgia, this study advances the understanding of the neurobiology of chronic widespread pain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Regional gray matter alterations in chronic pain, as detected with voxel-based morphometry of anatomical magnetic resonance images, are commonly interpreted to reflect neurodegeneration, but this assumption has not been tested. We found decreased gray matter in fibromyalgia to be associated with T1 relaxation times, a surrogate marker of water content, but not with GABA(A) receptor concentration, a surrogate of neuronal integrity. In contrast, regional gray matter increases were partly explained by GABA(A) receptor concentration, indicating some form of neuronal plasticity. The study emphasizes that voxel-based morphometry is an exploratory measure, demonstrating the need to investigate the histological origin of gray matter alterations for every distinct clinical entity, and advances the understanding of the neurobiology of chronic (widespread) pain."

Understanding the temporal course of this axonal pathology is of high relevance to comprehend the progression of the disease over time. We performed a long-term in vivo study (up to 210 days of two-photon imaging) with two transgenic mouse models (dE9xGFP-M and APP-PS1xGFP-M). Interestingly, AxDs were formed only in a quarter of GFP-expressing axons near Abeta-plaques, which indicates a selective vulnerability. AxDs, especially those reaching larger sizes, had long lifetimes and appeared as highly plastic structures with large variations in size and shape and axonal sprouting over time. In the case of the APP-PS1 mouse only, the formation of new long axonal segments in dystrophic axons (re-growth phenomenon) was observed. Moreover, new AxDs could appear at the same point of the axon where a previous AxD had been located before disappearance (re-formation phenomenon). In addition, we observed that most AxDs were formed and developed during the imaging period, and numerous AxDs had already disappeared by the end of this time. This work is the first in vivo study analyzing quantitatively the high plasticity of the axonal pathology around Abeta plaques. We hypothesized that a therapeutically early prevention of Abeta plaque formation or their growth might halt disease progression and promote functional axon regeneration and the recovery of neural circuits."

Non-invasive subtype differentiation by imaging facilitates prognostication and treatment selection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of a diagnostic imaging key based on tumor morphology, T2 signal intensity on MRI, and tumor vascularity for differentiating RCC into its subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a custom-designed diagnostic imaging key, three blinded fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists independently evaluated the cross-sectional imaging of 50 histologically proven RCCs and categorized these into subtypes in two sessions. The diagnostic performance of the imaging key was evaluated and compared to the baseline performance without the key. RESULTS: The 50 RCCs comprised 20 (40%) clear cell, 17 (34%) papillary, and 13 (26%) chromophobe tumors. All expert readers demonstrated an improvement in diagnostic accuracy by an average of 5.3% with the use of the key. The readers showed good to excellent diagnostic performance for clear cell RCC (area under the receiver operating curve, AUROC of 0.86-0.91) and papillary RCC (AUROC of 0.82-0.87), and fair performance with chromophobe RCC (AUROC of 0.67-0.77). The Reader-to-SOR (standard of reference) agreement increased from 0.53 (moderate) to 0.67 (good) with the use of the key. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic imaging key facilitates RCC subtype characterization and can be used as a decision support tool."

Although the classification of lung cancer has been updated to become more specific, only a small subset of the total morphological features are taken into consideration. The vast majority of the detailed morphological features of tumor tissues, particularly tumor cells' surrounding microenvironment, are not fully analyzed. The heterogeneity of tumor cells and close interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironments are closely related to tumor development and progression. The goal of this study is to develop morphological feature-based prediction models for the prognosis of patients with lung cancer. METHOD: We developed objective and quantitative computational approaches to analyze the morphological features of pathological images for patients with NSCLC. Tissue pathological images were analyzed for 523 patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 511 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer cohorts. The features extracted from the pathological images were used to develop statistical models that predict patients' survival outcomes in ADC and SCC, respectively. RESULTS: We extracted 943 morphological features from pathological images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue and identified morphological features that are significantly associated with prognosis in ADC and SCC, respectively. Statistical models based on these extracted features stratified NSCLC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The models were developed from training sets and validated in independent testing sets: a predicted high-risk group versus a predicted low-risk group (for patients with ADC: hazard ratio = 2.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-4.91, p = 0.024; for patients with SCC: hazard ratio = 2.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.15-4.27, p = 0.017) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, and pathologic tumor stage. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the quantitative morphological features of tumor pathological images predict prognosis in patients with lung cancer."

Epub 2016 Nov 30.,Zhang Y,World Neurosurg,2017,2016/12/05,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.11.110,"OBJECTIVE: Preserving the facial nerve (FN) during surgery for large vestibular schwannomas (VSs) is challenging because of the unpredictable locations and morphologic changes in the FN. Diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) has been proposed to preoperatively visualize the FN. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of DTI-FT for predicting FN location and shape in patients with large VSs. METHODS: In this prospective study, imaging data from 30 consecutive patients with large VSs were obtained using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging. The DTI-FT results included the location of the reconstructed FN relative to the tumor, and maximal fractional anisotropy (MFA) threshold values for FN tracking were determined with iPlan software. Intraoperative findings including the location of FN relative to the tumor and shape were determined by microscopic observations and electrophysiologic monitoring. A correlation analysis was performed between the DTI-FT results and intraoperative findings. RESULTS: Preoperative visualization of the FN using DTI-FT was successful in all 30 patients. The location of the cisternal segment of the FN in relation to the tumors predicted by DTI-FT was consistent with the intraoperative findings in 29 (96.7%) of the 30 patients. The area under the curve of MFA for differentiation between the compact and flat FN was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.98) (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: DTI-FT with modified tracking settings was useful to preoperatively predict the location of FN in patients with large VSs. The MFA of FN demonstrated moderate diagnostic performance for distinguishing compact from flat FNs."

Microscopic changes in the UA mucosal lining of OSA subjects are reported; however, the impact of these changes on UA mucosal surface topography is unknown. This study aimed to 1) develop methodology to measure UA mucosal surface topography, and 2) compare findings from healthy and OSA subjects. Ten healthy and eleven OSA subjects were studied. Awake, gated (end expiration), head and neck position controlled magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the velopharynx (VP) were obtained. VP mucosal surfaces were segmented from axial images, and three-dimensional VP mucosal surface models were constructed. Curvature analysis of the models was used to study the VP mucosal surface topography. Principal, mean, and Gaussian curvatures were used to define surface shape composition and surface roughness of the VP mucosal surface models. Significant differences were found in the surface shape composition, with more saddle/spherical and less flat/cylindrical shapes in OSA than healthy VP mucosal surface models (P < 0.01). OSA VP mucosal surface models were also found to have more mucosal surface roughness (P < 0.0001) than healthy VP mucosal surface models. Our novel methodology was utilized to model the VP mucosal surface of OSA and healthy subjects. OSA subjects were found to have different VP mucosal surface topography, composed of increased irregular shapes and increased roughness. We speculate increased irregularity in VP mucosal surface may increase pharyngeal collapsibility as a consequence of friction-related pressure loss.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A new methodology was used to model the upper airway mucosal surface topography from magnetic resonance images of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and healthy adults. Curvature analysis was used to analyze the topography of the models, and a new metric was derived to describe the mucosal surface roughness. Increased roughness was found in the obstructive sleep apnea vs. healthy group, but further research is required to determine the functional effects of the measured difference on upper airway airflow mechanics."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables three dimensional visualization of biological tissue with micrometer level resolution at high speed, and can play an important role in early diagnosis and treatment guidance of breast cancer. In particular, ultra-high resolution (UHR) OCT provides images with better histological correlation. This paper compared UHR OCT performance with standard OCT in breast cancer imaging qualitatively and quantitatively. Automatic tissue classification algorithms were used to automatically detect invasive ductal carcinoma in ex vivo human breast tissue. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human breast tissues, including non-neoplastic/normal tissues from breast reduction and tumor samples from mastectomy specimens, were excised from patients at Columbia University Medical Center. The tissue specimens were imaged by two spectral domain OCT systems at different wavelengths: a home-built ultra-high resolution (UHR) OCT system at 800 nm (measured as 2.72 mum axial and 5.52 mum lateral) and a commercial OCT system at 1,300 nm with standard resolution (measured as 6.5 mum axial and 15 mum lateral), and their imaging performances were analyzed qualitatively. Using regional features derived from OCT images produced by the two systems, we developed an automated classification algorithm based on relevance vector machine (RVM) to differentiate hollow-structured adipose tissue against solid tissue. We further developed B-scan based features for RVM to classify invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) against normal fibrous stroma tissue among OCT datasets produced by the two systems. For adipose classification, 32 UHR OCT B-scans from 9 normal specimens, and 28 standard OCT B-scans from 6 normal and 4 IDC specimens were employed. For IDC classification, 152 UHR OCT B-scans from 6 normal and 13 IDC specimens, and 104 standard OCT B-scans from 5 normal and 8 IDC specimens were employed. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that UHR OCT images can produce images with better feature delineation compared with images produced by 1,300 nm OCT system. UHR OCT images of a variety of tissue types found in human breast tissue were presented. With a limited number of datasets, we showed that both OCT systems can achieve a good accuracy in identifying adipose tissue. Classification in UHR OCT images achieved higher sensitivity (94%) and specificity (93%) of adipose tissue than the sensitivity (91%) and specificity (76%) in 1,300 nm OCT images. In IDC classification, similarly, we achieved better results with UHR OCT images, featured an overall accuracy of 84%, sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 71% in this preliminary study. CONCLUSION: In this study, we provided UHR OCT images of different normal and malignant breast tissue types, and qualitatively and quantitatively studied the texture and optical features from OCT images of human breast tissue at different resolutions. We developed an automated approach to differentiate adipose tissue, fibrous stroma, and IDC within human breast tissues. Our work may open the door toward automatic intraoperative OCT evaluation of early-stage breast cancer. Lasers Surg. Med. 49:258-269, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

New prognostic factors for this group of disease need to be investigated. This study evaluated the histopathological significance and prognostic impact of tumor budding in CRC. DESIGN: A total of 60 treatment naive consecutive patients undergoing surgical resection for CRC during the period of January 2011 to December 2013 were included in the study. Details of each patient related to their demographic and tumor profile were recorded. Pan Cytokeratin immunohistochemistry was applied on chosen sections and tumor budding was assessed. RESULTS: The most frequent site of involvement was rectosigmoid and sigmoid colon (31.6%). The majority of the cases were moderately differentiated (75%) in morphology, and showed tumor invasion into the pericolic/subserosal fat (66.6%), and were stage III (38.3%). Nodal involvement was present in 50% cases. Correlations between tumor budding and nodal involvement (p-value 0.039) and AJCC stage (p-value 0.021) were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Tumor budding may be a promising and powerful predictor of lymphnodal metastasis and a higher stage of tumor and can be used as a marker for assessing the aggressiveness of CRC. Routine hemotoxylin-eosin staining supported by cytokeratin immunostain can aid in the grading of tumor budding in CRC."

Quantitative characterization of spheroids at the cellular level is fundamental. We present the first pipeline that provides three-dimensional, high-quality images of intact spheroids at cellular resolution and a comprehensive image analysis that completes traditional image segmentation by algorithms from other fields. The pipeline combines light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy of optically cleared spheroids with automated nuclei segmentation (F score: 0.88) and concepts from graph analysis and computational topology. Incorporating cell graphs and alpha shapes provided more than 30 features of individual nuclei, the cellular neighborhood and the spheroid morphology. The application of our pipeline to a set of breast carcinoma spheroids revealed two concentric layers of different cell density for more than 30,000 cells. The thickness of the outer cell layer depends on a spheroid's size and varies between 50% and 75% of its radius. In differently-sized spheroids, we detected patches of different cell densities ranging from 5 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(6 )cells/mm(3). Since cell density affects cell behavior in tissues, structural heterogeneities need to be incorporated into existing models. Our image analysis pipeline provides a multiscale approach to obtain the relevant data for a system-level understanding of tissue architecture."

However, it has been proposed that the aetiologies of ECM and HCM are distinct, and, consequently, no useful mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of HCM can be obtained from studying the ECM model. Therefore, in order to determine the similarities and differences in the pathology of ECM and HCM, we have performed the first spatial and quantitative histopathological assessment of the ECM syndrome. We demonstrate that the accumulation of parasitised red blood cells (pRBCs) in brain capillaries is a specific feature of ECM that is not observed during mild murine malaria infections. Critically, we show that individual pRBCs appear to occlude murine brain capillaries during ECM. As pRBC-mediated congestion of brain microvessels is a hallmark of HCM, this suggests that the impact of parasite accumulation on cerebral blood flow may ultimately be similar in mice and humans during ECM and HCM, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that cerebrovascular CD8+ T-cells appear to co-localise with accumulated pRBCs, an event that corresponds with development of widespread vascular leakage. As in HCM, we show that vascular leakage is not dependent on extensive vascular destruction. Instead, we show that vascular leakage is associated with alterations in transcellular and paracellular transport mechanisms. Finally, as in HCM, we observed axonal injury and demyelination in ECM adjacent to diverse vasculopathies. Collectively, our data therefore shows that, despite very different presentation, and apparently distinct mechanisms, of parasite accumulation, there appear to be a number of comparable features of cerebral pathology in mice and in humans during ECM and HCM, respectively. Thus, when used appropriately, the ECM model may be useful for studying specific pathological features of HCM."

Epub 2017 Jan 19.,Vennat E,Acta Biomater,2017,2017/01/23,,,10.1016/j.actbio.2017.01.052,"In this paper, the 3D-morphology of the porosity in dentin is investigated within the first 350mum from the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) by fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). We found that the porous microstructure exhibits a much more complex geometry than classically described, which may impact our fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior of teeth and could have practical consequences for dental surgery. Our 3D observations reveal numerous fine branches stemming from the tubules which may play a role in cellular communication or mechanosensing during the early stages of dentinogenesis. The effect of this highly branched microstructure on the local mechanical properties is investigated by means of numerical simulations. Under simplified assumptions on the surrounding tissue characteristics, we find that the presence of fine branches negatively affects the mechanical properties by creating local stress concentrations. However, this effect is reduced by the presence of peritubular dentin surrounding the tubules. The porosity was also quantified using the CSLM data and compared to this derived from SEM imaging. A bimodal distribution of channel diameters was found near the DEJ with a mean value of 1.5-2mum for the tubules and 0.3-0.5mum for the fine branches which contribute to 30% of the total porosity ( approximately 1.2%). A gradient in the branching density was observed from the DEJ towards the pulp, independently of the anatomical location. Our work constitutes an incentive towards more elaborate multiscale studies of dentin microstructure to better assess the effect of aging and for the design of biomaterials used in dentistry, e.g. to ensure more efficient bonding to dentin. Finally, our analysis of the tubular network structure provides valuable data to improve current numerical models."

The first workflow is applicable for thin-slice analysis, and uses transmission-polarimetry-guided Desorption ElectroSpray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (DESI-MS), and confirmatory H&E histopathology analysis on the same slice; this is validated using quantitative digital pathology methods. The second workflow explores a polarimetry-guided MS platform for thick tissue assessment by developing reflection-mode polarimetric imaging coupled with a hand-held Picosecond InfraRed Laser (PIRL) MS ablation probe that requires minimal tissue removal to produce detectable signal. Tissue differentiation within 5-10 s of sampling with the hand-held probe is shown using multivariate statistical methods of the MS profiles. Both workflows were tasked with differentiating necrotic cancer sites from viable cancers using a breast tumour model, and their performance was evaluated. The use of the same tissue surface addresses mismatches in guidance due to intrinsic changes in tissue morphology over consecutive sections."

DWI was performed using a multi-slice single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence with b values of 0, 50, 200, 500 and 1000 s/mm.2 A polygonal region of interest was drawn within the tumors on every b image. The following parameters were retrieved from IVIM: apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion (D), pseudo diffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion factor (f), and relative perfusion f.D*. In every case, cell count, nucleic areas, proliferation index KI 67, and microvessel density were estimated on histopathological specimens. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to analyze the association between the parameters. ADC correlated well with KI 67 index and D tended to correlate with cell count and KI 67. ADC and D tended to correlate with total nucleic area. The perfusion factor f correlated well with stained vessel area, total vessel area, and vessel count. D* and fD* correlated with mean vessel diameter. Distant metastasized tumors had higher D* and fD* values. IVIM parameter reflected different clinical and histopathological features in rectal cancer."

Purpose To determine the association between synchronous metastatic disease in patients with T4 gastric cancer and EMVI detected on contrast-enhanced multiple-row detector computed tomography (MDCT). Material and Methods A total of 152 patients with T4 gastric carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed and divided into EMVI-positive and EMVI-negative groups where EMVI, as detected on MDCT, was defined as a tubular or nodular soft tissue thickening extending from the tumor along the vessels of the mesentery. Synchronous metastases were detected by MDCT and/or confirmed by postoperative diagnosis. Logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the predictive factors of synchronous metastases in gastric cancer. Results Synchronous metastases were found in 47 of 152 (30.9%) patients with T4 gastric cancer. Thirty-one of 77 (40.3%) patients in the EMVI-positive group had evidence of metastases compared to 16 (21.3%) of 75 patients in the EMVI-negative group ( P = 0.019). Synchronous metastases were significantly associated with EMVI with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.250 (95% CI, 1.072-4.724). Conclusion EMVI-positive tumors, as an adverse imaging feature, were significantly associated with synchronous metastases in patients with T4 gastric cancer."

The present work is focused on in vitro evaluation of the biocompatibility of these materials, before and after soaking in a simulated body fluid (SBF). X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry and pH measurements were employed in glass-ceramic characterisation. The free-radical mediated reactivity of the glass-ceramic was evaluated by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spin trapping. Cell adhesion and proliferation tests were carried out by using 3T3 murine fibroblasts. Cytotoxicity was performed by qualitative evaluation of human bone osteosarcoma cells U2OS cell line. The results show that almost two times more 3T3 cells proliferated on the samples pre-treated in SBF, compared with the untreated specimens. Moreover a decrease of confluence was observed at 48 and 72h for U2OS cells exposed to the untreated glass-ceramic, while the powder suspensions of glass-ceramic pre-treated in SBF did not influence the cell morphology up to 72h of exposition. The untreated glass-ceramic exhibited Fenton-like reactivity, as well as reactivity towards formate molecule. After pre-treatment with SBF the reactivity towards formate was completely suppressed. The concentration of iron released into the SBF solution was below 0.1ppm at 37 degrees C, during one month of soaking. The different in vitro behaviour of the samples before and after SBF treatment has been correlated to the bioactive glass-ceramic surface modifications as detected by morphological, structural and compositional analyses."

We describe the MR imaging characteristics of this new tumor entity in pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed imaging features of pediatric patients with midline gliomas with or without the histone H3 K27 mutation. We evaluated the imaging features of these tumors on the basis of location, enhancement pattern, and necrosis. RESULTS: Among 33 patients with diffuse midline gliomas, histone H3 K27M mutation was present in 24 patients (72.7%) and absent in 9 (27.3%). Of the tumors, 27.3% (n = 9) were located in the thalamus; 42.4% (n = 14), in the pons; 15% (n = 5), within the vermis/fourth ventricle; and 6% (n = 2), in the spinal cord. The radiographic features of diffuse midline gliomas with histone H3 K27M mutation were highly variable, ranging from expansile masses without enhancement or necrosis with large areas of surrounding infiltrative growth to peripherally enhancing masses with central necrosis with significant mass effect but little surrounding T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. When we compared diffuse midline gliomas on the basis of the presence or absence of histone H3 K27M mutation, there was no significant correlation between enhancement or border characteristics, infiltrative appearance, or presence of edema. CONCLUSIONS: We describe, for the first time, the MR imaging features of pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with histone H3 K27M mutation. Similar to the heterogeneous histologic features among these tumors, they also have a diverse imaging appearance without distinguishing features from histone H3 wildtype diffuse gliomas."

The quantitative determination of elastic fibres will provide information on the state of the vascular wall and to determine the role and behaviour of this key structural element in different physiological and pathological vascular processes. METHODS: We present a segmentation method to identify and quantify elastic fibres based on a local threshold technique and some morphological characteristics measured on the segmented objects that facilitate the discrimination between elastic fibres and other image components. The morphological characteristics analysed are the thickness and the length of an object. RESULTS: The segmentation method was evaluated using an image database of vein sections stained with Weigert's resorcin-fuchsin. The performance results are based on a ground truth generated manually resulting in values of sensitivity greater than 80% with the exception in two samples, and specificity values above 90% for all samples. Medical specialists carried out a visual evaluation where the observations indicate a general agreement on the segmentation results' visual quality, and the consistency between the methodology proposed and the subjective observation of the doctors for the evaluation of pathological changes in vessel wall. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methodology provides more objective measurements than the qualitative methods traditionally used in the histological analysis, with a significant potential for this method to be used as a diagnostic aid for many other vascular pathological conditions and in similar tissues such as skin and mucous membranes."

Image segmentation is the most important step of quantitative image analysis. In spite of availability of many segmentation methods, the accurate segmentation is challenging when the images are heterogeneous with respect to object shapes and signal intensities what is typical for images of endocytic vesicles. We present a Morphological reconstruction and Contrast mapping segmentation method (MrComas) for the segmentation of the endocytic vesicle population that copes with the heterogeneity in their shape and intensity. The method uses morphological opening and closing by reconstruction in the vicinity of local minima and maxima respectively thus creating the strong contrast between their basins of attraction. As a consequence, the intensity is flattened within the objects and their edges are enhanced. The method accurately recovered quantitative characteristics of synthetic images that preserve characteristic features of the endocytic vesicle population. In benchmarks and quantitative comparisons with two other popular segmentation methods, namely manual thresholding and Squash plugin, MrComas shows the best segmentation results on real biological images of EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) endocytosis. As a proof of feasibility, the method was applied to quantify the dynamical behavior of Early Endosomal Autoantigen 1 (EEA1)-positive endosome subpopulations during EGF-stimulated endocytosis."

Specifically, the composition, orientation, and alignment of collagen fibers in tumor-adjacent stroma affect tumor growth and metastasis. Most of the work done on measuring this prognostic marker has involved imaging of collagen fibers using second-harmonic generation microscopy (SHGM), which provides label-free specificity. Here, we show that spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM), a label-free quantitative phase imaging technique, is able to provide information on collagen-fiber orientation that is comparable to that provided by SHGM. Due to its wide-field geometry, the throughput of the SLIM system is much higher than that of SHGM and, because of the linear imaging, the equipment is simpler and significantly less expensive. Our results indicate that SLIM images can be used to extract important prognostic information from collagen fibers in breast tissue, potentially providing a convenient high throughput clinical tool for assessing patient prognosis."

Several mechanisms have been proposed to identify the etiology and pathogenesis so that specific treatments can be given to patients with psoriasis. AIMS: (1) To compare pattern and distribution of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD31 in patients with psoriasis and other psoriasiform lesions of skin. (2) To study the correlation between VEGF and CD31 expression, clinical severity, and histopathology of psoriasiform lesions of skin. (3) Evaluation of microvessel density (MVD) by using computer-assisted quantitative image analysis in psoriatic skin lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on eighty cases, out of which forty were diagnosed cases of psoriasis and forty cases of clinically suspected psoriasiform lesions, submitted in the Department of Pathology, Pt. B.D. Sharma, University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, for histopathological examination. Histopathological sections were stained by routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, and these biopsies were further subjected to immunohistochemical staining with VEGF and CD31 as per standard technique. RESULTS: Assessment of various histopathological features revealed strong correlation between epidermal hyperplasia, suprapapillary thinning, and elongation of rete ridges. Suprabasilar keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions stained intensely for VEGF. The difference for number of microvessels and MVD in psoriasis and psoriasiform lesions was statistically significant. Correlation between intensity of VEGF staining by suprabasilar keratinocytes and MVD was found to be highly significant in psoriatic lesions. CONCLUSION: The present study concluded that psoriatic lesions exhibit potent angiogenic activity. Early lesions show increased MVD along with other histomorphological parameters such as hypogranulosis, parakeratosis and Munro's microabscesses. Overexpression of VEGF by suprabasilar keratinocytes correlated with increased MVD in papillary dermis."

However, this laboratory diagnosis requires medical specialists which are lacking in many of the areas where these infections are most prevalent. In response to this public health issue, we developed a software based on pattern recognition analysis from microscopi digital images of fecal smears, capable of automatically recognizing and diagnosing common human intestinal parasites. To this end, we selected 229, 124, 217, and 229 objects from microscopic images of fecal smears positive for Taenia sp., Trichuris trichiura, Diphyllobothrium latum, and Fasciola hepatica, respectively. Representative photographs were selected by a parasitologist. We then implemented our algorithm in the open source program SCILAB. The algorithm processes the image by first converting to gray-scale, then applies a fourteen step filtering process, and produces a skeletonized and tri-colored image. The features extracted fall into two general categories: geometric characteristics and brightness descriptions. Individual characteristics were quantified and evaluated with a logistic regression to model their ability to correctly identify each parasite separately. Subsequently, all algorithms were evaluated for false positive cross reactivity with the other parasites studied, excepting Taenia sp. which shares very few morphological characteristics with the others. The principal result showed that our algorithm reached sensitivities between 99.10%-100% and specificities between 98.13%- 98.38% to detect each parasite separately. We did not find any cross-positivity in the algorithms for the three parasites evaluated. In conclusion, the results demonstrated the capacity of our computer algorithm to automatically recognize and diagnose Taenia sp., Trichuris trichiura, Diphyllobothrium latum, and Fasciola hepatica with a high sensitivity and specificity."

The posterior scleral cup of 8 eyes from 6 human donors was mounted onto a custom inflation chamber. A laser-scanning microscope was used for second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging of the collagen structure in the posterior volume of the LC at pressures from 5mmHg to 45mmHg. The SHG volumes were analyzed by the Fast-Fourier Iterative Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) algorithm for the three dimensional (3D) displacement field. The components of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor and the in-plane principal and maximum shear strains were evaluated from the DVC displacement field for the central and peripheral regions of the LC and the nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior quadrants surrounding the central retinal artery and vein. Among the major findings were that older age was associated with lower strains, the maximum shear strain was larger in the peripheral than central region, and the maximum principal strain was lower in the nasal quadrant. The elliptical shape of the LC was also predictive of the biaxial strain ratio. Age-related and structure-related variations in the pressure-induced strains of the LC may contribute to the susceptibility and severity of optic nerve damage in glaucoma, and regional variations may explain the progression of axonal damage and tissue remodeling observed in the LC in glaucoma. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Glaucoma causes vision loss through progressive damage of the retinal ganglion axons at the lamina cribrosa (LC), the connective tissue structure that supports the axons as they leave the eye. Mechanical characterization of the LC is challenging because of the complex 3D shape and inaccessibility of the tissue. We present a new method using digital volume correlation to map the 3D displacement and strain fields in the LC under inflation. We report for the first time significant regional variations in the strains that are consistent with the pattern of optic nerve damage in early glaucoma. Thus regional strain variations may be predictive of the progression of axonal damage in glaucoma."

Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical."

Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular system (t-system) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-system in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery. METHODS: Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD. RESULTS: The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37+/-0.01 versus 0.46+/-0.02; P<0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36+/-0.01 versus 0.25+/-0.02 microm(2); P<0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor-sarcolemma distances (0.96+/-0.05 versus 0.64+/-0.1 microm; P<0.01). Low ryanodine receptor-sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (P<0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (P<0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor-sarcolemma distances >1 microm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-system density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9+/-4.9 versus 10.3+/-1.7 milliseconds; P<0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1+/-1.5 versus 8.9+/-2.2 milliseconds; P<0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density. CONCLUSIONS: The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-system impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-system at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading."

We compared two computational pathology platforms on their measurement of breast tumour oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression. METHODS: Breast tumour microarrays from the Nurses' Health Study were stained for ER (n=592) and PR (n=187). One expert pathologist scored cases as positive if >/=1% of tumour nuclei exhibited stain. ER and PR were then measured with the Definiens Tissue Studio (automated) and Aperio Digital Pathology (user-supervised) platforms. Platform-specific measurements were compared using boxplots, scatter plots and correlation statistics. Classification of ER and PR positivity by platform-specific measurements was evaluated with areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) from univariable logistic regression models, using expert pathologist classification as the standard. RESULTS: Both platforms showed considerable overlap in continuous measurements of ER and PR between positive and negative groups classified by expert pathologist. Platform-specific measurements were strongly and positively correlated with one another (r>/=0.77). The user-supervised Aperio workflow performed slightly better than the automated Definiens workflow at classifying ER positivity (AUC(Aperio)=0.97; AUC(Definiens)=0.90; difference=0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09) and PR positivity (AUC(Aperio)=0.94; AUC(Definiens)=0.87; difference=0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Paired hormone receptor expression measurements from two different computational pathology platforms agreed well with one another. The user-supervised workflow yielded better classification accuracy than the automated workflow. Appropriately validated computational pathology algorithms enrich molecular epidemiology studies with continuous protein expression data and may accelerate tumour biomarker discovery."

METHODS: Morphometric data of 110 patients who underwent initial hepatectomy after preoperative chemotherapy were reviewed. TLVs before and after chemotherapy were measured using a computer-based volumetry software and their relevance to clinical factors was investigated. RESULTS: More than 10% of decrease in TLV was observed in 42 (38.2%) patients, and more than 10% of increase was observed in 11 (10.0%) patients. Change in TLV was within 10% in the remaining 57 (51.8%) patients. Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15) value was significantly higher in patients with TLV decrease more than 10% (13.4 vs. 9.3 vs. 8.5%; p = 0.004). Steatosis in the underlying liver was significantly frequent in patients with TLV increase more than 10% (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that more than 10% of shrinkage in TLV after chemotherapy was independently associated with ICG-R15 >15% (odds ratio 8.8; p = 0.0001). Tendency of correlation was confirmed in the kinetic changes in TLV and ICG-R15 during chemotherapy even though there was no statistical significance (r = -0.33, p = 0.080). CONCLUSION: Perichemotherapy kinetic changes in TLV may predict histopathologic changes or changes in hepatic functional reserve in the underlying liver. More than 10% of shrinkage in TLV is associated with impaired hepatic functional reserve, and it can be a new supplemental finding in the prediction of surgical risk of major hepatectomy for CLM."

In this work, we present an automatic technique based on generalized Laplacian of Gaussian (gLoG) filter for nuclei detection in digitized histological images. The proposed technique first generates a bank of gLoG kernels with different scales and orientations and then performs convolution between directional gLoG kernels and the candidate image to obtain a set of response maps. The local maxima of response maps are detected and clustered into different groups by mean-shift algorithm based on their geometrical closeness. The point which has the maximum response in each group is finally selected as the nucleus seed. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance in nuclei detection compared to existing techniques."

It is thought to result from intermittent or partial torsion of the ovary compromising the venous and lymphatic drainage but with preserved arterial supply. The clinical features of massive ovarian edema are nonspecific and can simulate tumors, leading to unnecessary oophorectomy. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate imaging features that should alert radiologists to consider the diagnosis of massive ovarian edema preoperatively so that fertility-sparing surgery may be considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified five girls diagnosed with massive ovarian edema at pathology. Presenting symptoms, sidedness, imaging appearance, preoperative diagnosis, and operative and histopathological findings were reviewed. RESULTS: Age range was 9.6-14.3 years (mean age: 12.5 years). Common imaging findings included ovarian enlargement with edema of the stroma, peripherally placed follicles, isointense signal on T1-W MRI and markedly hyperintense signal on T2-W MRI, preservation of color Doppler flow by US, and CT Hounsfield units below 40. The uterus was deviated to the affected side in all patients. Two of the five patients had small to moderate amounts of free pelvic fluid. Mean ovarian volume on imaging was 560 mL (range: 108-1,361 mL). CONCLUSION: While the clinical presentation of massive ovarian edema is nonspecific, an enlarged ovary with stromal edema, peripherally placed follicles and preservation of blood flow may be suggestive and wedge biopsy should be considered intraoperatively to avoid unnecessary removal of the ovary."

Epub 2017 Mar 6.,Rojas-Moraleda R,Med Image Anal,2017,2017/03/18,,,10.1016/j.media.2017.02.009,"The segmentation of cell nuclei is an important step towards the automated analysis of histological images. The presence of a large number of nuclei in whole-slide images necessitates methods that are computationally tractable in addition to being effective. In this work, a method is developed for the robust segmentation of cell nuclei in histological images based on the principles of persistent homology. More specifically, an abstract simplicial homology approach for image segmentation is established. Essentially, the approach deals with the persistence of disconnected sets in the image, thus identifying salient regions that express patterns of persistence. By introducing an image representation based on topological features, the task of segmentation is less dependent on variations of color or texture. This results in a novel approach that generalizes well and provides stable performance. The method conceptualizes regions of interest (cell nuclei) pertinent to their topological features in a successful manner. The time cost of the proposed approach is lower-bounded by an almost linear behavior and upper-bounded by O(n(2)) in a worst-case scenario. Time complexity matches a quasilinear behavior which is O(n(1+varepsilon)) for epsilon < 1. Images acquired from histological sections of liver tissue are used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The histological landscape consists of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells. The accuracy of the proposed methodology is verified against an automated workflow created by the output of a conventional filter bank (validated by experts) and the supervised training of a random forest classifier. The results are obtained on a per-object basis. The proposed workflow successfully detected both hepatocyte and non-parenchymal cell nuclei with an accuracy of 84.6%, and hepatocyte cell nuclei only with an accuracy of 86.2%. A public histological dataset with supplied ground-truth data is also used for evaluating the performance of the proposed approach (accuracy: 94.5%). Further validations are carried out with a publicly available dataset and ground-truth data from the Gland Segmentation in Colon Histology Images Challenge (GlaS) contest. The proposed method is useful for obtaining unsupervised robust initial segmentations that can be further integrated in image/data processing and management pipelines. The development of a fully automated system supporting a human expert provides tangible benefits in the context of clinical decision-making."

Epub 2017 Mar 8.,Wan S,Med Image Anal,2017,2017/03/23,PMC5479412,NIHMS861080,10.1016/j.media.2017.03.002,"This paper proposes a texture analysis technique that can effectively classify different types of human breast tissue imaged by Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM). OCM is an emerging imaging modality for rapid tissue screening and has the potential to provide high resolution microscopic images that approach those of histology. OCM images, acquired without tissue staining, however, pose unique challenges to image analysis and pattern classification. We examined multiple types of texture features and found Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features to perform better in classifying tissues imaged by OCM. In order to improve classification accuracy, we propose novel variants of LBP features, namely average LBP (ALBP) and block based LBP (BLBP). Compared with the classic LBP feature, ALBP and BLBP features provide an enhanced encoding of the texture structure in a local neighborhood by looking at intensity differences among neighboring pixels and among certain blocks of pixels in the neighborhood. Fourty-six freshly excised human breast tissue samples, including 27 benign (e.g. fibroadenoma, fibrocystic disease and usual ductal hyperplasia) and 19 breast carcinoma (e.g. invasive ductal carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ) were imaged with large field OCM with an imaging area of 10 x 10 mm(2) (10, 000 x 10, 000 pixels) for each sample. Corresponding H&E histology was obtained for each sample and used to provide ground truth diagnosis. 4310 small OCM image blocks (500 x 500 pixels) each paired with corresponding H&E histology was extracted from large-field OCM images and labeled with one of the five different classes: adipose tissue (n = 347), fibrous stroma (n = 2,065), breast lobules (n = 199), carcinomas (pooled from all sub-types, n = 1,127), and background (regions outside of the specimens, n = 572). Our experiments show that by integrating a selected set of LBP and the two new variant (ALBP and BLBP) features at multiple scales, the classification accuracy increased from 81.7% (using LBP features alone) to 93.8% using a neural network classifier. The integrated feature was also used to classify large-field OCM images for tumor detection. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained with an area under the curve value of 0.959. A sensitivity level of 100% and specificity level of 85.2% was achieved to differentiate benign from malignant samples. Several other experiments also demonstrate the complementary nature of LBP and the two variants (ALBP and BLBP features) and the significance of integrating these texture features for classification. Using features from multiple scales and performing feature selection are also effective mechanisms to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency."

Biophysical parameters, such as the S/V of tissue membranes, can be used to estimate microscopic length scales non-invasively. However, due to gradient strength limitations on clinical MRI scanners, pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) measurements are impractical for probing the S/V limit. To achieve this limit on clinical systems, an oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) sequence was developed. Two phantoms containing 10 fiber bundles, each consisting of impermeable aligned fibers with different packing densities, were constructed to achieve a range of S/V values. The frequency-dependent diffusion coefficient, D(omega), was measured in each fiber bundle using OGSE with different gradient waveforms (cosine, stretched cosine, and trapezoidal), while D(t) was measured from PGSE and stimulated-echo measurements. The S/V values derived from the universal high-frequency behavior of D(omega) were compared against those derived from quantitative proton density measurements using single spin echo (SE) with varying echo times, and from magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF). S/V estimates derived from different OGSE waveforms were similar and demonstrated excellent correlation with both SE- and MRF-derived S/V measures (rho  >/=  0.99). Furthermore, there was a smoother transition between OGSE frequency f and PGSE diffusion time when using teffS/V=9/64f, rather than the commonly used t(eff)  = 1/(4f), validating the specific frequency/diffusion time conversion for this regime. Our well-characterized fiber phantom can be used for the calibration of OGSE and diffusion modeling techniques, as the S/V ratio can be measured independently using other MR modalities. Moreover, our calibration experiment offers an exciting perspective of mapping tissue S/V on clinical systems."

METHODS: 49 females with 53 breast lesions underwent breast MRI. The MRI magnetic field is 1.5 T, and the protocol is standard MRI sequences, dynamic sequences pre- and post-contrast agent administration and diffusion images. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was applied as part of our standard breast MRIota protocol. Two experienced radiologists on breast MRI, blinded to the final diagnosis, reviewed the parametric maps and placed a volume of interest on all slices including each lesion. Kurtosis [K apparent (K(app))] and corrected apparent diffusion coefficient [D apparent (D(app))] median values were then calculated from the whole-lesion histogram analysis. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the most effective cut-off values for the differentiation between benign and malignant pathologies. Histological analysis of the breast lesions was performed, and further comparative analysis of the results was performed to investigate the accuracy of the method. RESULTS: Benign (n = 19) and malignant lesions (n = 34) had mean diameters of 20.8 mm (10.1-31.5 mm) and 26.4 mm (10.5-42.3 mm), respectively. The lowest and the highest kurtosis values (K(app)) of malignant lesions were significantly higher than those of benign lesions. A cut-off of 0.71 provided specificity of 93.7% and sensitivity 97.1%, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.976 (p < 0.0001). The lowest and the highest D(app) values of malignant lesions were lower than those of benign lesions. A cut-off value of 1.57 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) provided specificity of 93.7% and sensitivity of 91.2% with AUC of 0.949 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: DKI is an accurate additional tool for the characterization and differentiation of breast lesions with high K(app) and D(app) sensitivity and specificity rates. Advances in knowledge: DKI is able to distinguish benign from malignant breast pathologies. DKI increases the specificity of breast MRI."

Traditional manual microscopy, which depends on the operator's expertise and subjective factors, has high false-positive rates (i.e., low specificity) and low efficiency. To date, there are many detection methods for biological cells based on morphological characteristics. However, the morphology of trichomonads changes, and its size is not fixed; moreover, they are similar to human leukocytes. Therefore, it is difficult to classify trichomonads based on morphological characteristics. In this study, a moving object detection method based on an improved Kalman background reconstruction algorithm is proposed to detect trichomonads automatically, considering the dynamic characteristics of trichomonads at room temperature. The experimental results show that the trichomonads can be accurately identified, and the phenomena of tailing and ghosts are eliminated. Furthermore, this algorithm easily adapts to continuous or sudden changes in light, focal length variation, and the impact of lens shift, and it has good robustness and only a moderate amount of calculation burden."

Methodologic limitations have obscured microscopic determination of cellular and layer-level alterations. This study used a combination of advanced imaging by multiphoton autofluorescence microscopy (MPAM) and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy along with tissue optical clearing to characterize the 3Dimensional multilayer organization of placental membranes. METHODS: Placental membranes biopsies (6 mm) collected from term, not-in-labor cesarean deliveries (n = 7) were fixed in 10% formalin (native) or treated with 2,2'-thiodiethanol to render them transparent for deeper imaging. Native and cleared tissues were imaged using MPAM (cellular autofluorescence) and SHG (fibrillar collagen). Depth z-stacks captured the amnion epithelium, underlying matrix layers, and in the cleared biopsies, the decidua layer. RESULTS: MPAM and SHG revealed fetal membrane epithelial topography and collagen organization in multiple matrix layers. Term amnion layers showed epithelial shedding and gaps. Optical clearing provided full-depth imaging with improved visualization of collagen structure, mesenchymal cells in extracellular matrix layers, and decidua morphology. Layer thicknesses measured by imaging corroborated with histology. Mosaic tiling of MPAM/SHG image stacks allowed large area visualization of entire biopsies. CONCLUSION: MPAM-SHG microscopy allowed for study of this multi-layered tissue and revealed shedding, gap formation, and other structural changes. This approach could be used to study structural changes associated with membranes as well as other uterine tissues to better understand events in normal and abnormal parturition."

Easily visualized by fluorescence microscopy, the stress fibers are widely used as qualitative descriptors of cell phenotypes. However, due to the complexity of the stress fibers and the presence of other actin-containing cellular features, images of stress fibers are relatively challenging to quantitatively analyze using previously developed approaches, requiring significant user intervention. This poses a challenge for the automation of their detection, segmentation, and quantitative analysis. RESULT: Here we describe an open-source software package, SFEX (Stress Fiber Extractor), which is geared for efficient enhancement, segmentation, and analysis of actin stress fibers in adherent tissue culture cells. Our method made use of a carefully chosen image filtering technique to enhance filamentous structures, effectively facilitating the detection and segmentation of stress fibers by binary thresholding. We subdivided the skeletons of stress fiber traces into piecewise-linear fragments, and used a set of geometric criteria to reconstruct the stress fiber networks by pairing appropriate fiber fragments. Our strategy enables the trajectory of a majority of stress fibers within the cells to be comprehensively extracted. We also present a method for quantifying the dimensions of the stress fibers using an image gradient-based approach. We determine the optimal parameter space using sensitivity analysis, and demonstrate the utility of our approach by analyzing actin stress fibers in cells cultured on various micropattern substrates. CONCLUSION: We present an open-source graphically-interfaced computational tool for the extraction and quantification of stress fibers in adherent cells with minimal user input. This facilitates the automated extraction of actin stress fibers from fluorescence images. We highlight their potential uses by analyzing images of cells with shapes constrained by fibronectin micropatterns. The method we reported here could serve as the first step in the detection and characterization of the spatial properties of actin stress fibers to enable further detailed morphological analysis."

Analysis of images begins with the definition of particle boundaries. Commonly a single threshold defines the level for a pixel in the image to be included in the detection of particles, but depending on the threshold level, this results in either missing translucent particles or oversizing of less transparent particles due to the halos and gradients in intensity near the particle boundaries. We have developed an imaging analysis algorithm that sets the threshold for a particle based on the maximum gray value of the particle. We show that this results in tighter boundaries for particles with high contrast, while conserving the number of highly translucent particles detected. The method is implemented as a plugin for FIJI, an open-source image analysis software. The method is tested for calibration beads in water and glycerol/water solutions, a suspension of microfabricated rods, and stir-stressed aggregates made from IgG. The result is that appropriate thresholds are automatically set for solutions with a range of particle properties, and that improved boundaries will allow for more accurate sizing results and potentially improved particle classification studies."

We applied laboratory-based instrumentation [3D X-ray microscope (3DXRM), MicroXCT-200; Carl Zeiss/Xradia, Inc.] that reaches the same resolution as synchrotron microscopy. We used serial transiliac bone biopsy specimens to examine the effect of macroanatomic bone type and estrogen status on osteocyte lacunar properties. These properties include lacunar size (volume, axes lengths of the ellipsoidal lacunar voids), distribution (density, average near-neighbor lacunar distance), and shape factors (sphericity ratio, average eigenvalues, degree of equancy, elongation, and flatness) in both cortical and trabecular bone tissue. The lacunar properties (volume, surface area, density, near-neighbor distance, etc.) and the shape factors (E1, L1, L2, degree of equancy, degree of elongation) were different between cortical and trabecular bone regardless of estrogen status. In cortical bone and trabecular nodes, the lacunar void volume and surface area were either smaller or tended to be smaller in postmenopausal as compared to premenopausal women. The void volume-to-bone volume ratio of cortical bone showed declining trends with estrogen loss. While there were differences between trabecular and cortical bone tissue, the lacunar void sphericity ratio for trabecular struts shows decreasing trends in postmenopausal women. These data suggest that using 3DXRM can provide new insight into osteocyte lacunar properties in transiliac bone biopsies from patients with various skeletal disease/conditions and pharmaceutical treatments."

Seventy-two intracranial aneurysms (41 ruptured and 31 unruptured) from 63 patients were studied retrospectively. All aneurysms were divided into two categories: narrow (aspect ratio >/=1.4) and wide-necked (aspect ratio <1.4 or neck width >/=4 mm). Computational fluid dynamics was used to determine the distribution of WSS, which was analyzed between different morphological groups and between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Sections of the walls of clipped aneurysms were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, observed under a microscope, and photographed. Ruptured aneurysms were statistically more likely to have a greater low WSS area ratio (LSAR) (P = 0.001) and higher aneurysms parent WSS ratio (P = 0.026) than unruptured aneurysms. Narrow-necked aneurysms were statistically more likely to have a larger LSAR (P < 0.001) and lower values of MWSS (P < 0.001), mean aneurysm-parent WSS ratio (P < 0.001), HWSS (P = 0.012), and the highest aneurysm-parent WSS ratio (P < 0.001) than wide-necked aneurysms. The aneurysm wall showed two different pathological changes associated with high or low WSS in wide-necked aneurysms. Aneurysm morphology could affect the distribution and magnitude of WSS on the basis of differences in blood flow. Both high and low WSS could contribute to focal wall damage and rupture through different mechanisms associated with each morphological type."

Variation in topography was observed with atomic force microscopy and the expansion of the fingermark occurred in the form of the development of an intermediate area surrounding the main fingermark ridge. On an example area of a fingermark on silicon, the intermediate region exists as a uniform 4nm thick deposit; on day 1 after deposition this region extends approximately 2mum from the edge of the main ridge deposit and expands to a maximum of  approximately 4mum by day 23. Simultaneously the region breaks up, the integrity is compromised by day 16, and by day 61 the area resembles a series of interconnected islands, with coverage of approximately 60%. Observation of a similar immediate area and growth with time on surfaces such as Formica was possible by monitoring the mechanical characteristics of the fingermark and surfaces though phase contrast in tapping mode AFM. The presence of this area may affect fingermark development, for example affecting the gold distribution in vacuum metal deposition. Further study of time dependence and variation with donor may enable assessment of this area to be used to evaluate the age of fingermarks."

We aimed to evaluate, in cross-sectional analysis of non-diabetic controls and patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with and without neuropathy, the agreement between manual and automated analysis protocols. METHODS: Sixty-eight controls, 139 type 1 diabetes, and 249 type 2 diabetes participants underwent CNFL measurement (N=456). Neuropathy status was determined by clinical and electrophysiological criteria.

Percent bias was similar across non-diabetic controls (-33+/-12%), type 1 (-30+/-20%), and type 2 diabetes (-28+/-16%) subgroups (ANOVA, p=0.068), and similarly in diabetes participants with and without neuropathy. Levels of CNFL(Auto) and CNFL(Manual) were both inversely associated with neuropathy status. CONCLUSIONS: Although CNFL(Auto) substantially underestimated CNFL(Manual), its bias was non-differential between diverse patient groups and its relationship with neuropathy status was preserved. Determination of diagnostic thresholds specific to CNFL(Auto) should be pursued in diagnostic studies of diabetic neuropathy."

In asthma, ASM mass is increased, but it is unknown whether ASM orientation and morphology are altered as well or whether the remodeling at the source of the mass increase is ongoing. We dissected human airway trees from asthmatic and control lungs. Stained, intact airway sections were imaged in axial projection to show ASM bundle orientation, whereas cross-sectional histological slides were used to assess ASM area, bundle thickness, and ASM bundle-to-basement membrane distance. We also used these slides to assess cell size, proliferation, and apoptosis. We showed that ASM mass increase in cartilaginous airways is primarily the result of an increase of ASM bundle thickness (as measured radially in an airway cross section) and coincides with an increased distance of the ASM bundles to the airway perimeter. ASM orientation was unchanged in all airways. Apoptosis markers and cell size did not show differences between asthmatics and controls. Our findings show that ASM mass increase likely contributes to the airway-constricting capacity of the muscle. Both the increased bundle thickness and increased thickness of the airway wall inwards of the ASM bundles could further enhance this capacity. Turnover of ASM appears to be the same in airways and biopsies, but the lack of correlation between different markers of proliferation casts doubt on the specificity of markers generally used to assess proliferation."

Epub 2017 May 9.,Deguette C,Morphologie,2017,2017/05/13,,,10.1016/j.morpho.2017.03.008,"AIM: Estimation of age at death is a major issue in anthropology. The main anthropological histological methods propose studying the architecture of cortical bone. In bone histomorphometry, researches on metabolic bone diseases have provided normative tables for trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) according to age and gender of individuals on trans-iliac bone biopsies. We have used microCT, a non-destructive tool for measuring bone volume and trabecular descriptors to compare the French tables to a series of forensic anthropological population and if the two iliac bones could be used interchangeably. METHODOLOGY: Coxal bone of a personal forensic collection whose age and gender were known (DNA identification) were used. Bone samples, centered on the same area than bone biopsy. MicroCT (pixel size: 36mum) was used to measure BV/TV and morphometric trabecular parameters of microarchitecture. An adjusted Z-score was calculated for BV/TV to compare with normative tables and a right/left comparison of trabecular parameters was provided. RESULTS: Twenty-seven iliac bones, which 20 forming 10 complete pelvises, aged between 24 and 73y.o. (average of 47.7 y.o.) were used. All adjusted Z-score were within normal values. There was a strong positive correlation between right and left sides for Tb.Th, Tb.N and Tb.Sp, but an insignificant correlation was obtained for BV/TV. CONCLUSION: Normative tables between age and BV/TV are valid and therefore usable in anthropology. They may represent an alternative to determine the age at death. Nevertheless, it requires a precise technique that could be a drawback in current practice."

The diagnosis of biopsy tissue with hematoxylin and eosin stained images is non-trivial and specialists often disagree on the final diagnosis. Computer-aided Diagnosis systems contribute to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of this process. Conventional classification approaches rely on feature extraction methods designed for a specific problem based on field-knowledge. To overcome the many difficulties of the feature-based approaches, deep learning methods are becoming important alternatives. A method for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed. Images are classified in four classes, normal tissue, benign lesion, in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma, and in two classes, carcinoma and non-carcinoma. The architecture of the network is designed to retrieve information at different scales, including both nuclei and overall tissue organization. This design allows the extension of the proposed system to whole-slide histology images. The features extracted by the CNN are also used for training a Support Vector Machine classifier. Accuracies of 77.8% for four class and 83.3% for carcinoma/non-carcinoma are achieved. The sensitivity of our method for cancer cases is 95.6%."

Macrophages have remarkable plasticity in response to environmental cues and are able to acquire a spectrum of activation status, best exemplified by pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes at the two ends of the spectrum. Characterisation of M1 and M2 subsets is usually carried out by quantification of multiple cell surface markers, transcription factors and cytokine profiles. These approaches are time-consuming, require large numbers of cells and are resource intensive. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to develop a simple and fast imaging-based approach that enables automated identification of different macrophage functional phenotypes using their cell size and morphology. Fluorescent microscopy was used to assess cell morphology of different cell types which were stained for nucleus and actin distribution using DAPI and phalloidin respectively. By only analysing their morphology we were able to identify M1 and M2 phenotypes effectively and could distinguish them from naive macrophages and monocytes with an average accuracy of 90%. Thus we suggest high-content and automated image analysis can be used for fast phenotyping of functionally diverse cell populations with reasonable accuracy and without the need for using multiple markers."

This is also the case of colorectal cancer (CRC) where several such categorizations have been proposed. Despite recent developments, the problem of subtype definition and recognition remains open, one of the causes being the intrinsic heterogeneity of each tumor, which is difficult to estimate from gene expression profiles. However, one of the observations of these studies indicates that there may be links between the dominant tumor morphology characteristics and the molecular subtypes. Benefiting from a large collection of CRC samples, comprising both gene expression and histopathology images, we investigated the possibility of building image-based classifiers able to predict the molecular subtypes. We employed deep convolutional neural networks for extracting local descriptors which were then used for constructing a dictionary-based representation of each tumor sample. A set of support vector machine classifiers were trained to solve different binary decision problems, their combined outputs being used to predict one of the five molecular subtypes. RESULTS: A hierarchical decomposition of the multi-class problem was obtained with an overall accuracy of 0.84 (95%CI=0.79-0.88). The predictions from the image-based classifier showed significant prognostic value similar to their molecular counterparts. CONTACT: popovici@iba.muni.cz.

Epub 2017 Mar 6.,Kumar N,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2017,2017/03/14,,,10.1109/TMI.2017.2677499,"Nuclear segmentation in digital microscopic tissue images can enable extraction of high-quality features for nuclear morphometrics and other analysis in computational pathology. Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other H&E-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six LSIL biopsies were studied. In the follow-up, a second biopsy showed 28.7% regression, 37.9% LSIL, and 33.4% progressed to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Immunostaining for these markers were performed in the first biopsy. A qualitative evaluation method was used, as well as histomorphometry, using ImageJ software. Pearson chi, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Fisher tests were used to compare the groups (P </= .05). A cutoff point was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curve positive cell ratio, for each marker, as progression predictors. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with and without progression was 33 and 27 years (P = .006), respectively. The qualitative evaluation indicated a tendency of progression, but without statistical significance. However, through histomorphometry, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed cutoff points of 0.396, 0.345, and 0.026 for p16, CK7, and Ki-67 ratios, respectively, as predictors of progression (P = .003, .03, and .002, respectively). In a logistic regression analysis, p16, CK7, and Ki-67 positive cell ratio showed a significant correlation with progression (P = .036, .012, and .006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: p16, CK7, and Ki-67 may represent useful biomarkers that can identify LSIL lesions that need particular attention."

Epub 2017 May 15.,Kumar R,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2017,2017/07/10,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.05.003,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For cancer detection from microscopic biopsy images, image segmentation step used for segmentation of cells and nuclei play an important role. Accuracy of segmentation approach dominate the final results. Also the microscopic biopsy images have intrinsic Poisson noise and if it is present in the image the segmentation results may not be accurate. The objective is to propose an efficient fuzzy c-means based segmentation approach which can also handle the noise present in the image during the segmentation process itself i.e. noise removal and segmentation is combined in one step. METHODS: To address the above issues, in this paper a fourth order partial differential equation (FPDE) based nonlinear filter adapted to Poisson noise with fuzzy c-means segmentation method is proposed. This approach is capable of effectively handling the segmentation problem of blocky artifacts while achieving good tradeoff between Poisson noise removals and edge preservation of the microscopic biopsy images during segmentation process for cancer detection from cells. RESULTS: The proposed approach is tested on breast cancer microscopic biopsy data set with region of interest (ROI) segmented ground truth images. The microscopic biopsy data set contains 31 benign and 27 malignant images of size 896 x 768. The region of interest selected ground truth of all 58 images are also available for this data set. Finally, the result obtained from proposed approach is compared with the results of popular segmentation algorithms; fuzzy c-means, color k-means, texture based segmentation, and total variation fuzzy c-means approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results shows that proposed approach is providing better results in terms of various performance measures such as Jaccard coefficient, dice index, Tanimoto coefficient, area under curve, accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, random index, global consistency error, and variance of information as compared to other segmentation approaches used for cancer detection."

From an anatomical point of view strictly contralateral interconnections link the cerebellum to the cerebral cortex mainly through the middle and superior cerebellar peduncle. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) based tractography has already been applied to address cortico-cerebellar-cortical loops in healthy subjects and to detect diffusivity alteration patterns in patients with neurodegenerative pathologies of the cerebellum. In the present study we used dMRI-based tractography to determine the degree and pattern of pathological changes of cerebellar white matter microstructure in patients with focal cerebellar lesions. Diffusion imaging and high-resolution volumes were obtained in patients with left cerebellar lesions and in normal controls. Middle cerebellar peduncles and superior cerebellar peduncles were reconstructed by multi fiber diffusion tractography. From each tract, measures of microscopic damage were assessed, and despite the presence of unilateral lesions, bilateral diffusivity differences in white matter tracts were found comparing patients with normal controls. Consistently, bilateral alterations were also evidenced in specific brain regions linked to the cerebellum and involved in higher-level functions. This could be in line with the evidence that in the presence of unilateral cerebellar lesions, different cognitive functions can be affected and they are not strictly linked to the side of the cerebellar lesion."

Here, we present adaptive Morphologically Constrained Spectral Unmixing (MCSU) algorithms that overcome this limitation by exploiting morphological differences between sub-cellular structures, and their local spatial context. RESULTS: The proposed method was effective at improving spectral unmixing performance by exploiting: (i) a set of dictionary-based models for object morphologies learned from the image data; and (ii) models of spatial context learned from the image data using a total variation algorithm. The method was evaluated on multi-spectral images of multiplex-labeled pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissue samples. The former constraint ensures that neighbouring pixels correspond to morphologically similar structures, and the latter constraint ensures that neighbouring pixels have similar spectral signatures. The average Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Signal Reconstruction Error (SRE) ratio of the proposed method was 39.6% less and 8% more, respectively, compared to the best of all other algorithms that do not exploit these spatial constraints.

Here, we describe the generation and data analysis of 3D microtissue models from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Standard of care anti-cancer drugs were applied and the altered multicellular morphologies were captured by confocal microscopy, followed by automated image analyses to quantitatively measure phenotypic features for high-content chemosensitivity tests. The obtained image data were thresholded using a local entropy filter after which the image foreground was split into local regions, for a supervised classification into tumor or fibroblast cell types. Robust statistical methods were applied to evaluate treatment effects on growth and morphology. Both novel and existing computational approaches were compared at each step, while prioritizing high experimental throughput. Docetaxel was found to be the most effective drug that blocked both tumor growth and invasion. These effects were also validated in PDX tumors in vivo. Our research opens new avenues for high-content drug screening based on patient-derived cell cultures, and for personalized chemosensitivity testing."

MATERIALS AND METHOD: One hundred and six chronic HBV-related HCC patients who underwent IVIM diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with eleven b values were enrolled. Mean ADC, diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) values were determined for all detected lesions. The metrics and AFP levels of different histologically differentiated groups were compared. Spearman's rank correlation was used to assess the statistical dependence among the histologically differentiated HCCs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate diagnostic performance of these metrics and AFP levels alone and in combination. RESULTS: ADC, D, and f values and AFP levels were significantly different among well-, moderately, and poorly differentiated HCCs. The four metrics were significantly correlated with histologic differentiation. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of ADC, D, f, and AFP for diagnosing well-differentiated HCCs was 0.903, 0.84, 0.782, and 0.806, respectively, and the AUC-ROC of above metrics for diagnosing poorly differentiated HCCs was 0.787, 0.726, 0.624, and 0.633, respectively. The combination of ADC and AFP provided an AUC-ROC of 0.945 for well-differentiated HCC. However, this did not provide better performance for diagnosing poorly differentiated HCC. CONCLUSION: ADC, IVIM metrics, and AFP levels may be useful for evaluating histologic differentiation of HBV-related HCCs, and the combination of ADC and AFP provides better diagnostic performance for well-differentiated HCC."

As there is no perfect method for image segmentation and fully automatic image analysis of complex content, we aimed to succeed by identification of unique and reliable features within the sample. Through exemplary use of a coculture of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages (MPs), we demonstrate how rare interactions within this highly variable sample type can be analyzed. Because of limitations in immunocytochemistry in our specific setup, we developed a semiautomatic approach to examine the interaction of lipid-laden MPs with VSMCs under hypoxic conditions based on nuclei morphology by high-content analysis using the open-source software CellProfiler ( www.cellprofiler.org ). We provide evidence that, in comparison with fully automatic analysis, a low threshold within the analysis workflow and subsequent manual control save time, while providing more objective and reliable results."

The multiclass classification based on the ""one-versus- all"" method that built a voting rule approach to classify the liver images based on the liver state. Specifically, quantitative parameters, such as the anisotropy and laminarity are proposed based on the relative orientation of the pixel pairs in a global and local coherence of gradient vectors approach. Analysis of the tissue texture data using both gradient vector and gradient angle co-occurrence matrix approaches facilitated more definitive identification of the abnormal tissue. The experimental results established that the local anisotropy based texture measures are appropriated for the microtexture analysis in order to discriminate between pathologies. Macrotexture description using the global features provided only integral anisotropy coefficient that has a confidence level similar to those provided by the local feature."

More objective techniques have not been well studied yet. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the ability of prenatal 3-dimensional power Doppler analysis of flow and vascular indices to predict the morbidly adherent placenta objectively. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was performed in women between 28 and 32 gestational weeks with known placenta previa. Patients underwent a two-dimensional gray-scale ultrasound that determined management decisions. 3-Dimensional power Doppler volumes were obtained during the same examination and vascular, flow, and vascular flow indices were calculated after manual tracing of the viewed placenta in the sweep; data were blinded to obstetricians. Morbidly adherent placenta was confirmed by histology. Severe morbidly adherent placenta was defined as increta/percreta on histology, blood loss >2000 mL, and >2 units of PRBC transfused. Sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated. Student t and chi(2) tests, logistic regression, receiver-operating characteristic curves, and intra- and interrater agreements using Kappa statistics were performed. RESULTS: The following results were found: (1) 50 women were studied: 23 had morbidly adherent placenta, of which 12 (52.2%) were severe morbidly adherent placenta; (2) 2-dimensional parameters diagnosed morbidly adherent placenta with a sensitivity of 82.6% (95% confidence interval, 60.4-94.2), a specificity of 88.9% (95% confidence interval, 69.7-97.1), a positive predictive value of 86.3% (95% confidence interval, 64.0-96.4), a negative predictive value of 85.7% (95% confidence interval, 66.4-95.3), a positive likelihood ratio of 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.5-21.9), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.48); (3) mean values of the vascular index (32.8 +/- 7.4) and the vascular flow index (14.2 +/- 3.8) were higher in morbidly adherent placenta (P < .001); (4) area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the vascular and vascular flow indices were 0.99 and 0.97, respectively; (5) the vascular index >/=21 predicted morbidly adherent placenta with a sensitivity and a specificity of 95% (95% confidence interval, 88.2-96.9) and 91%, respectively (95% confidence interval, 87.5-92.4), 92% positive predictive value (95% confidence interval, 85.5-94.3), 90% negative predictive value (95% confidence interval, 79.9-95.3), positive likelihood ratio of 10.55 (95% confidence interval, 7.06-12.75), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.05 (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.13); and (6) for the severe morbidly adherent placenta, 2-dimensional ultrasound had a sensitivity of 33.3% (95% confidence interval, 11.3-64.6), a specificity of 81.8% (95% confidence interval, 47.8-96.8), a positive predictive value of 66.7% (95% confidence interval, 24.1-94.1), a negative predictive value of 52.9% (95% confidence interval, 28.5-76.1), a positive likelihood ratio of 1.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.41-8.11), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.26). A vascular index >/=31 predicted the diagnosis of a severe morbidly adherent placenta with a 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 72-100), a 90% specificity (95% confidence interval, 81.7-93.8), an 88% positive predictive value (95% confidence interval, 55.0-91.3), a 100% negative predictive value (95% confidence interval, 90.9-100), a positive likelihood ratio of 10.0 (95% confidence interval, 3.93-16.13), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0 (95% confidence interval, 0-0.34). Intrarater and interrater agreements were 94% (P < .001) and 93% (P < .001), respectively. CONCLUSION: The vascular index accurately predicts the morbidly adherent placenta in patients with placenta previa. In addition, 3-dimensional power Doppler vascular and vascular flow indices were more predictive of severe cases of morbidly adherent placenta compared with 2-dimensional ultrasound. This objective technique may limit the variations in diagnosing morbidly adherent placenta because of the subjectivity of 2-dimensional ultrasound interpretations."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to characterize in a quantitative manner the micromorphology of surfaces of new and unworn RGP CLs made of twelve different materials, AFM was taken and then analyzed using fractal methods. Surface topography was sampled in an intermittent-contact mode in air, on square areas of 5 x 5 microm(2) (MultiMode with Nanoscope V (Bruker). Spatial characteristics of 3-D surface texture were obtained using parameters defined in ISO 25178-2: 2012 norm. RESULTS: The surface texture turned out to have complex 3-D nanoscale geometry. For quantitative characterization of the properties of surface geometry at nanometer level of CL on the global scale, a series of fractal parameters was used. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical and fractal parameters of 3-D surfaces can be used by manufacturers to assess the micromorphology of CLs in order to improve their 3-D surface texture characteristics. These parameters can also be used in an elastic-plastic finite element model with contact elements to simulate the friction, wear and micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication at a nanometer scale between the CL with the corneal surface."

Epub 2017 May 3.,Abdalla R,J Dent,2017,2017/05/08,,,10.1016/j.jdent.2017.05.001,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the morphological and histological features of NCCLs in a group of extracted teeth using a focus variation optical microscopic technique that is capable of detecting minute variation in surface topography. METHODS: Twenty three extracted teeth containing NCCLs were collected. Histological features of the surface and longitudinal cross sections were examined using a focus variation microscope (FVM). RESULTS: The sample included 8 teeth with wedge-shaped lesions; the remaining 15 contained saucer-shaped lesions. Wedge-shaped lesions showed obliterated dentinal tubules, parallel furrows and micro-fractures in the surface; longitudinal cross sections revealed subsurface micro-fractures extending toward the pulp chamber. The surfaces of typical saucer-shaped lesions were smooth and relatively featureless. CONCLUSIONS: FVM imaging shows microstructures that are consistent with simultaneous erosion and toothbrush abrasion. Saucer shaped lesions have a smooth featureless surface as well as craters and dimples that could be attributed to uneven acid attack. In wedge-shaped lesions, the presence of scratches and furrows could be attributed to mechanical forces such as tooth brush abrasion. The furrows and in-surface micro-factures of wedge shaped lesions suggest a possible role of tensile stresses but require further investigation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: NCCLs present in two morphologies, either saucer-shaped or wedge-shaped. Erosion and toothbrush abrasion are important in both types of lesions. Tensile stresses due to occlusal loading may be important in some wedge-shaped lesions. Knowing the etiology of cervical lesions is the key for their prevention."

METHODS: 97 DBT images obtained for screening or diagnostic purposes were stored in both a workstation and a PACS and evaluated in combination with digital mammography by three independent radiologists retrospectively. Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System final assessments and likelihood of malignancy (%) were assigned and the interpretation time when using the workstation and PACS was recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivities and speci fi cities were compared with histopathological examination and follow-up data as a reference standard. RESULTS: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for cancer detection (0.839 vs 0.815, p = 0.6375) and sensitivity (81.8% vs 75.8%, p = 0.2188) showed no statistically significant differences between the workstation and PACS. However, specificity was significantly higher when analysing on the workstation than when using PACS (83.7% vs 76.9%, p = 0.009). When evaluating DBT images using PACS, only one case was deemed necessary to be reanalysed using the workstation. The mean time to interpret DBT images on PACS (1.68 min/case) was significantly longer than that to interpret on the workstation (1.35 min/case) (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Interpretation of DBT images using PACS showed comparable diagnostic performance to a dedicated workstation, even though it required a longer reading time. Advances in knowledge: Interpretation of DBT images using PACS is an alternative to evaluate the images when a dedicated workstation is not available."

Epub 2017 Jul 3.,Dadar M,Neuroimage,2017,2017/06/13,PMC6469398,NIHMS1003532,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.06.009,"INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are areas of abnormal signal on magnetic resonance images (MRIs) that characterize various types of histopathological lesions. The load and location of WMHs are important clinical measures that may indicate the presence of small vessel disease in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Manually segmenting WMHs is time consuming and prone to inter-rater and intra-rater variabilities. Automated tools that can accurately and robustly detect these lesions can be used to measure the vascular burden in individuals with AD or the elderly population in general. Many WMH segmentation techniques use a classifier in combination with a set of intensity and location features to segment WMHs, however, the optimal choice of classifier is unknown. METHODS: We compare 10 different linear and nonlinear classification techniques to identify WMHs from MRI data. Each classifier is trained and optimized based on a set of features obtained from co-registered MR images containing spatial location and intensity information. We further assess the performance of the classifiers using different combinations of MRI contrast information. The performances of the different classifiers were compared on three heterogeneous multi-site datasets, including images acquired with different scanners and different scan-parameters. These included data from the ADC study from University of California Davis, the NACC database and the ADNI study. The classifiers (naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, bagging, and boosting) were evaluated using a variety of voxel-wise and volumetric similarity measures such as Dice Kappa similarity index (SI), Intra-Class Correlation (ICC), and sensitivity as well as computational burden and processing times. These investigations enable meaningful comparisons between the performances of different classifiers to determine the most suitable classifiers for segmentation of WMHs. In the spirit of open-source science, we also make available a fully automated tool for segmentation of WMHs with pre-trained classifiers for all these techniques. RESULTS: Random Forests yielded the best performance among all classifiers with mean Dice Kappa (SI) of 0.66+/-0.17 and ICC=0.99 for the ADC dataset (using T1w, T2w, PD, and FLAIR scans), SI=0.72+/-0.10, ICC=0.93 for the NACC dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans), SI=0.66+/-0.23, ICC=0.94 for ADNI1 dataset (using T1w, T2w, and PD scans) and SI=0.72+/-0.19, ICC=0.96 for ADNI2/GO dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans). Not using the T2w/PD information did not change the performance of the Random Forest classifier (SI=0.66+/-0.17, ICC=0.99). However, not using FLAIR information in the ADC dataset significantly decreased the Dice Kappa, but the volumetric correlation did not drastically change (SI=0.47+/-0.21, ICC=0.95). CONCLUSION: Our investigations showed that with appropriate features, most off-the-shelf classifiers are able to accurately detect WMHs in presence of FLAIR scan information, while Random Forests had the best performance across all datasets. However, we observed that the performances of most linear classifiers and some nonlinear classifiers drastically decline in absence of FLAIR information, with Random Forest still retaining the best performance."

In contrast, LRRK1, the closest homologue to LRRK2, does not play any role in PD. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle analysis to gain structural insight into the full-length dimeric structures of LRRK2 and LRRK1. Differential scanning fluorimetry-based screening of purification buffers showed that elution of the purified LRRK2 protein in a high pH buffer is beneficial in obtaining high quality cryo-EM images. Next, analysis of the 3D maps generated from the cryo-EM data show 16 and 25 A resolution structures of full length LRRK2 and LRRK1, respectively, revealing the overall shape of the dimers with two-fold symmetric orientations of the protomers that is closely similar between the two proteins. These results suggest that dimerization mechanisms of both LRRKs are closely related and hence that specificities in functions of each LRRK are likely derived from LRRK2 and LRRK1's other biochemical functions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide 3D structural insights in LRRK2 and LRRK1 dimers in parallel."

The optimized DHM platform fingerprints every cell flowing through a microchannel at 10 000 cells per second, based on three features - size, maximum intensity and mean intensity. To identify tumor cells in a background of blood cells, we developed robust gating criteria using machine-learning approaches. We established classifiers from the features extracted from 100 000-cell training sets consisting of red blood cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor cell lines. The optimized classifier was then applied to targeted features of a single cell in a mixed cell population to make quantitative cell-type predictions. We tested our classification system with tumor cells spiked at different levels into a background of lysed blood that contained predominantly peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results show that our holographic screening method can readily detect as few as 10 tumor cells per mL, and can identify tumor cells at a false positive rate of at most 0.001%. This purely optical approach obviates the need for antibody labeling and allows large volumes of sample to be quickly processed. Moreover, our in-line DHM approach can be combined with existing circulation tumor cell enrichment strategies, making it a promising tool for label-free analysis of liquid-biopsy samples."

Epub 2016 Sep 14.,Lambert C,Neuroimage,2017,2016/09/19,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.08.028,"The thalamus consists of multiple nuclei that have been previously defined by their chemoarchitectual and cytoarchitectual properties ex vivo. These form discrete, functionally specialized, territories with topographically arranged graduated patterns of connectivity. However, previous in vivo thalamic parcellation with MRI has been hindered by substantial inter-individual variability or discrepancies between MRI derived segmentations and histological sections. Here, we use the Euclidean distance to characterize probabilistic tractography distributions derived from diffusion MRI. We generate 12 feature maps by performing voxel-wise parameterization of the distance histograms (6 feature maps) and the distribution of three-dimensional distance transition gradients generated by applying a Sobel kernel to the distance metrics. We use these 12 feature maps to delineate individual thalamic nuclei, then extract the tractography profiles for each and calculate the voxel-wise tractography gradients. Within each thalamic nucleus, the tractography gradients were topographically arranged as distinct non-overlapping cortical networks with transitory overlapping mid-zones. This work significantly advances quantitative segmentation of the thalamus in vivo using 3T MRI. At an individual subject level, the thalamic segmentations consistently achieve a close relationship with a priori histological atlas information, and resolve in vivo topographic gradients within each thalamic nucleus for the first time. Additionally, these techniques allow individual thalamic nuclei to be closely aligned across large populations and generate measures of inter-individual variability that can be used to study both basic function and pathological processes in vivo."

Purpose To identify optimal internal comparison standards for DWI to normalize the measured ADC for increased accuracy of differentiating malignant and benign abdominal lesions. Material and Methods We retrospectively studied 97 lesions (89 patients; age, 57 +/- 13 years) with histopathologically confirmed abdominal disease. Seven normal body parts/contents (normal parenchyma, spleen, kidney, gallbladder bile, paraspinal muscle, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) were assessed as internal references for possible use as comparison standards. Three observers performed ADC measurements. Statistical analyses included interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, and coefficient of variation (CV). ROC analyses were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy of lesion ADC and normalized ADC for differentiating lesions. Pathology results were the reference standard. Results Mean and normalized ADCs were significantly lower for malignant lesions than for benign lesions ( P < 0.001). ICC was excellent for all internal references. Gallbladder had the lowest CV. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that normalized ADCs obtained using normal parenchyma were better than lesion ADCs for differentiating malignant and benign abdominal lesions (area under the curve [AUC], 0.808 and 0.756, respectively). The normalized ADCs obtained using CSF shows higher accuracy than lesion ADCs (0.80 and 0.76, respectively) for differentiating between malignant and benign abdominal lesions. Conclusion The normal parenchyma from a lesion-detected organ can be used as an internal comparison standard for DWI. CSF can be used as a generalizable in plane reference standard."

Epub 2017 Apr 17.,Momenzadeh M,J Microsc,2017,2017/04/19,,,10.1111/jmi.12566,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the most common genital infections that are seen every day in clinics. This infection is due to excessive growth of Candida that are normally present in the vagina in small numbers. Diagnosis of VVC is routinely done by direct microscopy of Pap smear samples and searching for the Candida in the Pap smear glass slides. This manual method is subjective, time consuming, labour-intensive and tedious. This study presents a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) method to improve human diagnosis of VVC. The proposed CAD method reduces the diagnostic time and also can be worked as a second objective opinion for pathologists. Our main objective is detection and extraction of mycelium and conidium of Candida fungus from microscopic images of Pap smear samples. In this regard, the proposed method is composed of three main phases, namely preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. At the first phase, bottom-hat filtering is used for elimination of the cervical cells and separating the background. Then decorrelation stretching and colour K-means clustering are used for Candida segmentation. Finally the extracted features used by a decision tree classifier to detect Candida from other parts of smear. The proposed method was evaluated on 200 Pap smear images and showed specificity of 99.83% and 99.62% and sensitivity of 92.18% and 94.53% for detection of mycelium and conidium, respectively."

Epub 2017 Jul 18.,Zhang J,Med Phys,2017,2017/05/31,,,10.1002/mp.12381,"PURPOSE: Detection of leukocytes is critical for the routine leukorrhea exam, which is widely used in gynecological examinations. An elevated vaginal leukocyte count in women with bacterial vaginosis is a strong predictor of vaginal or cervical infections. In the routine leukorrhea exam, the counting of leukocytes is primarily performed by manual techniques. However, the viewing and counting of leukocytes from multiple high-power viewing fields on a glass slide under a microscope leads to subjectivity, low efficiency, and low accuracy. To date, many biological cells in stool, blood, and breast cancer have been studied to realize computerized detection; however, the detection of leukocytes in microscopic leukorrhea images has not been studied. Thus, there is an increasing need for computerized detection of leukocytes. METHODS: There are two key processes in the computerized detection of leukocytes in digital image processing. One is segmentation; the other is intelligent classification. In this paper, we propose a combined ensemble to detect leukocytes in the microscopic leukorrhea image. After image segmentation and selecting likely leukocyte subimages, we obtain the leukocyte candidates. Then, for intelligent classification, we adopt two methods: feature extraction and classification by a support vector machine (SVM); applying a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) to the larger subimages. If different methods classify a candidate in the same category, the process is finished. If not, the outputs of the methods are provided to a classifier to further classify the candidate. RESULTS: After acquiring leukocyte candidates, we attempted three methods to perform classification. The first approach using features and SVM achieved 88% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and 92.5% accuracy. The second method using CNN achieved 95% sensitivity, 84% specificity, and 89.5% accuracy. Then, in the combination approach, we achieved 92% sensitivity, 95% specificity, and 93.5% accuracy. Finally, the images with marked and counted leukocytes were obtained. CONCLUSION: A novel computerized detection system was developed for automated detection of leukocytes in microscopic images. Different methods resulted in comparable overall qualities by enabling computerized detection of leukocytes. The proposed approach further improved the performance. This preliminary study proves the feasibility of computerized detection of leukocytes in clinical use."

Following a previous report, the subsequent list of protocols describes how to reconstitute and quantify a tubular ER network in vitro based on purified microsomes from culture cells and cytosol from Xenopus laevis egg extracts. Biological material preparation and reconstitution assays require mostly basic laboratory instrumentation and chemicals, and can be executed without any specific training, making them appealing to a wide range of laboratories. Moreover, to promote conditions that are markedly more reflective of in vivo environments, this method describes for the first time in the literature, the purification of microsomes from HeLa cells in some detail. Basic Protocol 1 in this article describes the reconstitution process on different substrates including the associated fluorescence imaging process. Purification of ER microsomes and cytosol, both of which are needed for this approach, are described in detail in Support Protocols 1 and 2, respectively. Coating of surfaces with polyacrylamide gels is described in Support Protocol 3. Basic Protocol 2 outlines how to segment and skeletonize fluorescence images of ER networks, and how to quantify segment lengths between the network's branching points. The described quantitative evaluation provides a meaningful approach to analyze the topology and geometry of organelle structures. (c) 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

To unravel the mechanism of this type of DED, in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was used to investigate alterations in the state of the sub-basal nerves, dendritic cells (DCs) and globular immune cells (GICs) in the central cornea and limbal epithelia. In this study, we examined 12 HSCT recipients with GVHD-caused DED and 10 HSCT recipients without GVHD-associated DED and evaluated the clinical parameters in the 2 groups. Analysis of the central cornea and limbal epithelia using IVCM was conducted to investigate the density of the corneal sub-basal nerves, DCs and GICs as well as the tortuosity and branching of the sub-basal nerves. As suggested by our data, the clinical variables in the GVHD group were significantly different from those in the non-GVHD group. Additionally, GVHD-triggered DED conceivably increased the density of DCs and GICs in the central cornea and the density of DCs in limbal epithelia and altered the morphology of the sub-basal nerves. These phenomena are presumably correlated with the degree of inflammation. Thus, our findings may be translated into non-invasive diagnostic methods that indicate the severity of inflammation on the ocular surface in HSCT recipients."

Beyond decoding the gene expression, malfunctioning and cancer-related epigenetic pathways, investigations of the spatial receptor arrangements in membranes and genome organization in cell nuclei, on the nano-scale, contribute to elucidating complex molecular mechanisms in cells and tissues. By these means, the correlation between cell function and spatial organization of molecules or molecular complexes can be studied, with respect to carcinogenesis, tumor sensitivity or tumor resistance to anticancer therapies, like radiation or antibody treatment. Here, we present several new applications for bio-molecular nano-probes and super-resolution, laser fluorescence localization microscopy and their potential in life sciences, especially in biomedical and cancer research. By means of a tool-box of fluorescent antibodies, green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging, or specific oligonucleotides, we present tumor relevant re-arrangements of Erb-receptors in membranes, spatial organization of Smad specific ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (Smurf2) in the cytosol, tumor cell characteristic heterochromatin organization, and molecular re-arrangements induced by radiation or antibody treatment. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate how nano-scaled distance measurements between bio-molecules, tagged by appropriate nano-probes, can be applied to elucidate structures and conformations of molecular complexes which are characteristic of tumorigenesis and treatment responses. These applications open new avenues towards a better interpretation of the spatial organization and treatment responses of functionally relevant molecules, at the single cell level, in normal and cancer cells, offering new potentials for individualized medicine."

Unfortunately, this method inherently requires fluorescent labeling which has several drawbacks. Here we present a label-free method for evaluating cellular drug responses only by high-throughput bright-field imaging with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we performed high-throughput bright-field imaging of numerous drug-treated and -untreated cells (N = ~240,000) by optofluidic time-stretch microscopy with high throughput up to 10,000 cells/s and applied machine learning to the cell images to identify their morphological variations which are too subtle for human eyes to detect. Consequently, we achieved a high accuracy of 92% in distinguishing drug-treated and -untreated cells without the need for labeling. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that dose-dependent, drug-induced morphological change from different experiments can be inferred from the classification accuracy of a single classification model. Our work lays the groundwork for label-free drug screening in pharmaceutical science and industry."

Epub 2017 May 30.,Jain M,J Microsc,2017,2017/05/31,,,10.1111/jmi.12584,"AIMS: Atherosclerotic plaques vulnerable to rupture are almost always inflamed, and carry a large lipid core covered by a thin fibrous cap. The other components may include neovascularisation, intraplaque haemorrhage and spotty calcification. In contrast, stable plaques are characterised by a predominance of smooth muscle cells and collagen, and lipid core is usually deep seated or absent. This study is a proof of principle experiment to evaluate the feasibility of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to identify aforementioned plaque components. METHODS AND RESULTS: MPM is a nonlinear optical technique that allows imaging based on intrinsic tissue signals including autofluorescence and higher-order scattering. In our study, MPM imaging was performed on morphologically diverse aortic and coronary artery plaques obtained during autopsy. Various histologically verified plaque components including macrophages, cholesterol crystals, haemorrhage, collagen and calcification were recognised by MPM. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the distinct signatures of various plaque components suggests that MPM has the potential to offer next-generation characterisation of atherosclerotic plaques. The higher lateral resolution (comparable to histology) images generated by MPM for identifying plaque components might complement larger field of view and greater imaging depth currently available with optical coherence tomography imaging. As the next step MPM would need to be evaluated for intact vessel imaging ex vivo and in vivo."

Epub 2017 Jun 16.,Chen M,J Am Dent Assoc,2017,2017/06/19,,,10.1016/j.adaj.2017.05.013,"BACKGROUND: In this study, the authors investigated whether extension of a tooth crack into the root can be predicted by the appearance of the crack in the crown in vitro. METHODS: The authors obtained 22 cracked teeth from 22 patients who underwent extraction, and they scanned the teeth using microcomputed tomography. The length and width of the crack on the occlusal surface (LOS and WOS, respectively) and the length of the crack on the proximal surface (LCPS) were measured on 3-dimensional reconstruction images. The pulp chamber roof was penetrated and removed. A crack line visible under the microscope only on the access cavity wall rather than extending to the bottom of the pulp chamber was termed a ""nonroot crack."" A crack seen at the bottom of the pulp chamber or root wall was termed a ""root crack."" The authors analyzed the data using Pearson correlation coefficients and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the LOS and LCPS (correlation coefficient, 0.782; P < .001) and between the WOS and LCPS (correlation coefficient, 0.651; P < .05). The LCPS increased by 1.195 millimeters for every 1-mm increase in the LOS. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.839 (95% confidence interval, 0.659 to 1.000) for LOS and 0.760 (95% confidence interval, 0.557 to 0.964) for WOS. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of a crown crack may indicate how far the crack extends to the root. Both the LOS and WOS may be valuable for assessing whether a crack involves the root, although the LOS seems to be more useful. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The dimensions of a crack in a crown provide a helpful approach for predicting the depth of the crack and its likely prognosis."

One technique that is used to enable data analytics in large datasets is data sampling, in which a portion of the data is selected to preserve the data characteristics for use in data analytics. In this paper, we introduce a novel data sampling technique that is rooted in formal concept analysis theory. This technique is used to create samples reliant on the data distribution across a set of binary patterns. The proposed sampling technique is applied in classifying the regions of breast cancer histology images as malignant or benign. The performance of our method is compared to other classical sampling methods. The results indicate that our method is efficient and generates an illustrative sample of small size. It is also competing with other sampling methods in terms of sample size and sample quality represented in classification accuracy and F1 measure."

We employed NLO imaging technology to investigate the histology of normal and carcinomatous human colorectal muscularis in transverse and longitudinal views. Results show there are different patterns of pathological changes of muscularis in tissue structure and cell morphology from both views. The NLO imaging provides identical histological information as the H&E images but requires neither stain nor tissue processing. Our study indicates that NLO imaging technology shows more detailed microstructure, which is a critical complementary tool in pathological diagnosis of colorectal tumours. It suggests that NLO imaging could be a very important diagnostic tool to help pathologists realise the real time early detection of human colorectal tumours in the foreseeable future."

Hindering progress in our mechanistic understanding of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is the paucity of literature about the human olfactory bulb, both from normal and Parkinson's disease cases. Qualitatively it is well established that the neat arrangement of the glomerular array seen in the mouse olfactory bulb is missing in humans. But rigorous quantitative approaches to describe and compare the thousands of glomeruli in the human olfactory bulb are not available. Here we report a quantitative approach to describe the glomerular component of the human olfactory bulb, and its application to draw statistical comparisons between olfactory bulbs from normal and Parkinson's disease cases. We subjected horizontal 10 microm sections of olfactory bulbs from six normal and five Parkinson's disease cases to fluorescence immunohistochemistry with antibodies against vesicular glutamate transporter-2 and neural cell adhesion molecule. We scanned the immunostained sections with a fluorescence slide scanner, segmented the glomeruli, and generated 3D reconstructions of whole olfactory bulbs. We document the occurrence of atypical glomerular morphologies and glomerular-like structures deep in the olfactory bulb, both in normal and Parkinson's disease cases. We define a novel and objective parameter: the global glomerular voxel volume, which is the total volume of all voxels that are classified immunohistochemically as glomerular. We find that the global glomerular voxel volume in Parkinson's disease cases is half that of normal cases. The distribution of glomerular voxels along the dorsal-ventral dimension of the olfactory bulb in these series of horizontal sections is significantly altered in Parkinson's disease cases: whereas most glomerular voxels reside within the ventral half of olfactory bulbs from normal cases, glomerular voxels are more evenly spread among the ventral and dorsal halves of olfactory bulbs from Parkinson's disease cases. These quantitative whole-olfactory bulb analyses indicate a predominantly ventral deficit in the glomerular component in Parkinson's disease, consistent with the olfactory vector hypothesis for the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease. The distribution of serine 129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein immunoreactive voxels correlates with that of glomerular voxels. The higher the serine 129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein load of an olfactory bulb from a Parkinson's disease case, the lower the global glomerular voxel volume. Our rigorous quantitative approach to the whole olfactory bulb will help understand the anatomy and histology of the normal human olfactory bulb and its pathological alterations in Parkinson's disease."

Epub 2017 Sep 7.,Talas L,Med Hypotheses,2017,2017/10/23,,,10.1016/j.mehy.2017.09.004,"Early detection of mycoplasma infection is crucial for saving precious often irreplaceable data from the tissues of patients. Mycoplasma infections cause diseases in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, urethritis in men resulting in painful dysuria, urgency and urethral discharge. Cough, fever, headache, urethritis may persist for several weeks and convalescence is slow. The symptoms of these diseases are aggravated by the detection of mycoplasma infections, that takes either a long time, besides being expensive or is specific and restricted to only a limited number of contaminant strains. Mycoplasmas are hard to detect visually but could be seen and followed by time-lapse microscopy. Our hypothesis is that one can detect mycoplasma infection irrespective of its origin and type of mycoplasma. Main lines of supporting evidence are provided by the time-lapse microscopy showing dynamic morphological alterations caused by mycoplasmas before changes in human cell cultures become visible. Morphometric measurements of mycoplasma infections revealed four subphases: i) detachment of infected cells, ii) aggregation, iii) biofilm formation and iv) shrinkage of infected cells. The applicability of time-lapse microscopy for the detection of mycoplasma infection was validated by a mycoplasma test Kit. Most important implications related to morphometric parameters include the observation of mycoplasma infected cultures for an extended period of time instead of applying static snap-shot microscopy. A reliable method is offered to estimate the time of mycoplasma exposure that elapsed during the cell growth. This microphotometric approach served a more economical detection of mycoplasma contamination at its early stage of cell growth and spread, irrespective of the origin of contaminated serum, without defining the type of mycoplasma."

Although not a new concept, the quantification of histological features on photomicrographs used to be cumbersome, resource-intensive, and limited to specialists and specialized laboratories. Recent technological advances like highly efficient automated whole slide digitizer (scanner) systems, innovative IA platforms, and the emergence of pathologist-friendly image annotation and analysis systems mean that quantification of features on histological digital images will become increasingly prominent in pathologists' daily professional lives. The added value of quantitative IA in pathology includes confirmation of equivocal findings noted by a pathologist, increasing the sensitivity of feature detection, quantification of signal intensity, and improving efficiency. There is no denying that quantitative IA is part of the future of pathology; however, there are also several potential pitfalls when trying to estimate volumetric features from limited 2-dimensional sections. This continuing education session on quantitative IA offered a broad overview of the field; a hands-on toxicologic pathologist experience with IA principles, tools, and workflows; a discussion on how to apply basic stereology principles in order to minimize bias in IA; and finally, a reflection on the future of IA in the toxicologic pathology field."

There are also changes in microvasculature along with other histomorphorphological features. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the histomorphological features of DCM along with their quantitative correlation with LVEF. Alterations in collagen IV distribution pattern and microvasculature in DCM were also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study includes 34 right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies, 7 explanted native hearts and 41 autopsy control hearts. Sections were taken from lower half of right interventricular septum and stained for H and E, Masson trichrome and immunohistochemistry for CD34, SMA and Collagen IV to study the histological features, pattern of fibrosis, capillary and arteriolar distribution and collagen IV expression respectively. Morphometric analysis was carried out in all cases and controls using Image analysis software Image pro plus 7 and correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction. RESULTS: The histomorphological changes of DCM include myocyte hypertrophy, nucleomegaly, and interstitial fibrosis. Interfiber fibrosis was the commonest. There was evidence of myocarditis, ischemic change and vessel wall alterations. Considerable alteration in Collagen IV distribution was observed with reduction in intensity and proportion of staining around myocytes quantified using Allred scoring against uniform pericellular staining in controls. Morphometric analysis revealed significant increase in nuclear area, myocyte width, percentage of fibrosis and reduction in capillary myocyte ratio in cases as compared to controls. There was no significant difference in arteriolar density. No significant association was observed between morphometric parameters and LVEF. CONCLUSION: Histomorphological changes in DCM are non-specific. Quantitation of histological parameters cannot be used to predict the disease progression as there was no significant correlation with LVEF. There is appreciable alteration in Collagen IV distribution in DCM owing to extracellular matrix alterations."

An innovative CAD-software (Watson Elementary) was proposed to achieve high sensitivity and specificity, as well as to allege a correlate to Gleason grade. AIM/OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of Watson Elementary in automated PCa diagnosis in our hospital s database of MRI-guided prostate biopsies. METHODS: The evaluation was retrospective for 104 lesions (47 PCa, 57 benign) from 79, 64.61+/-6.64 year old patients using 3T T2-weighted imaging, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps and dynamic contrast enhancement series. Watson Elementary utilizes signal intensity, diffusion properties and kinetic profile to compute a proportional Gleason grade predictor, termed Malignancy Attention Index (MAI). The analysis focused on (i) the CAD sensitivity and specificity to classify suspect lesions and (ii) the MAI correlation with the histopathological ground truth. RESULTS: The software revealed a sensitivity of 46.80% for PCa classification. The specificity for PCa was found to be 75.43% with a positive predictive value of 61.11%, a negative predictive value of 63.23% and a false discovery rate of 38.89%. CAD classified PCa and benign lesions with equal probability (P 0.06, chi2 test). Accordingly, receiver operating characteristic analysis suggests a poor predictive value for MAI with an area under curve of 0.65 (P 0.02), which is not superior to the performance of board certified observers. Moreover, MAI revealed no significant correlation with Gleason grade (P 0.60, Pearson s correlation). CONCLUSION: The tested CAD software for mpMRI analysis was a weak PCa biomarker in this dataset. Targeted prostate biopsy and histology remains the gold standard for prostate cancer diagnosis."

The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenesis of ONFH from a biomechanical standpoint to provide a theoretical basis for improved treatments. We compared the bone structure of fractured femoral heads with that of necrotic femoral heads by Micro-CT scanning and histological evaluation. In addition, we compared the biomechanical properties of each zone in fractured femoral heads with those in necrotic femoral heads by using biomechanical tests. Compared with fractured femoral heads, bone microarchitecture and bone morphometry in necrotic zone and sclerotic zone of necrotic femoral heads have altered markedly. In addition, the biomechanical properties of the necrotic zone in femoral heads weaken markedly, while those of the sclerotic zone strengthen. We hypothesize that discordance between bone structure and function of the femoral head may be involved in the pathogenesis of ONFH and that more attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment of such discordance."

Each peripheral centre manages its' own health-care service independently and communicates with the central server for remote assistance. The proposed methodology for automated evaluation of parasites includes pre-processing of blood smear microscopic images followed by erythrocytes segmentation. To differentiate between different parasites; a total of 138 quantitative features characterising colour, morphology, and texture are extracted from segmented erythrocytes. An integrated pattern classification framework is designed where four feature selection methods viz. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Chi-square, Information Gain, and RELIEF are employed with three different classifiers i.e. Naive Bayes', C4.5, and Instance-Based Learning (IB1) individually. Optimal features subset with the best classifier is selected for achieving maximum diagnostic precision. It is seen that the proposed method achieved with 99.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity by combining CFS and C4.5 in comparison with other methods. Moreover, the web-based tool is entirely designed using open standards like Java for a web application, ImageJ for image processing, and WEKA for data mining considering its feasibility in rural places with minimal health care facilities."

METHODS: Diffusion MRI images were acquired from brain tumor patients using a special Stejskal-Tanner diffusion sequence with variable diffusion gradient amplitudes and separation times. Patients with histopathologically confirmed gliomas, including astrocytic and oligoastrocytic tumors, were selected. The FM-related parameters, including the Noah exponent ( alpha), the Hurst exponent ( H), and the memory parameter ( mu=H-1/alpha), were calculated and compared between low- and high-grade gliomas using a two-sample t-test. The grading performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in the present study. The calculated alpha, H, and mu permitted the separation of tumor lesions from surrounding normal tissues in parameter maps and helped differentiate glioma grades. Moreover, alpha showed greater sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing low- and high-grade gliomas compared with the apparent diffusion coefficient. CONCLUSION: The FM model could improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating low- and high-grade gliomas. This improved diffusion model may facilitate future studies of neuro-pathological changes in clinical populations. Magn Reson Med 78:1944-1949, 2017.

Current deep learning based recognition methods for histology data require collection of large volumes of labeled data in order to train a new neural network when there are changes to the image acquisition procedure. However, it is extremely expensive for pathologists to manually label sufficient volumes of data for each pathology study in a professional manner, which results in limitations in real-world applications. A very simple but effective deep learning method, that introduces the concept of unsupervised domain adaptation to a simple convolutional neural network (CNN), has been proposed in this paper. Inspired by transfer learning, our paper assumes that the training data and testing data follow different distributions, and there is an adaptation operation to more accurately estimate the kernels in CNN in feature extraction, in order to enhance performance by transferring knowledge from labeled data in source domain to unlabeled data in target domain. The model has been evaluated using three independent public epithelium-stroma datasets by cross-dataset validations. The experimental results demonstrate that for epithelium-stroma classification, the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art deep neural network model, and it also achieves better performance than other existing deep domain adaptation methods. The proposed model can be considered to be a better option for real-world applications in histopathological image analysis, since there is no longer a requirement for large-scale labeled data in each specified domain."

The expert pathologist investigates qualitatively the stained tissue slide under microscope to provide the Allred score; which is clinically used for therapeutic decision making. Such qualitative judgment is time-consuming, tedious and more often suffers from interobserver variability. As a result, it leads to imprecise IHC score for ER and PR. To overcome this, there is an urgent need of developing a reliable and efficient IHC quantifier for high throughput decision making. In view of this, our study aims at developing an automated IHC profiler for quantitative assessment of ER and PR molecular expression from stained tissue images. We propose here to use CMYK colour space for positively and negatively stained cell extraction for proportion score. Also colour features are used for quantitative assessment of intensity scoring among the positively stained cells. Five different machine learning models namely artificial neural network, Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbours, decision tree and random forest are considered for learning the colour features using average red, green and blue pixel values of positively stained cell patches. Fifty cases of ER- and PR-stained tissues have been evaluated for validation with the expert pathologist's score. All five models perform adequately where random forest shows the best correlation with the expert's score (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.9192). In the proposed approach the average variation of diaminobenzidine (DAB) to nuclear area from the expert's score is found to be 7.58%, as compared to 27.83% for state-of-the-art ImmunoRatio software."

Epub 2017 Aug 9.,Soon WC,Acta Neurochir (Wien),2017,2017/08/10,,,10.1007/s00701-017-3277-y,"INTRODUCTION: Advances in radiological imaging techniques have enabled volumetric measurements of meningiomas to be easily monitored using serial imaging scans. There is limited literature on the relationship between tumour growth rates and the WHO classification of meningiomas despite tumour growth being a major determinant of type and timing of intervention. Volumetric growth has been successfully used to assess growth of low-grade glioma; however, there is limited information on the volumetric growth rate (VGR) of meningiomas. This study aimed to determine the reliability of VGR measurement in patients with meningioma, assess the relationship between VGR and 2016 WHO grading as well as clinical applicability of VGR in monitoring meningioma growth. METHODS: All histologically proven intracranial meningiomas that underwent resection in a single centre between April 2009 and April 2014 were reviewed and classified according to the 2016 edition of the Classification of the Tumours of the CNS. Only patients who had two pre-operative scans that were at least 3 months apart were included in the study. Two authors performed the volumetric measurements using the Slicer 3D software independently and the inter-rater reliability was assessed. Multiple regression analyses of factors affecting the VGR and VDE of meningiomas were performed using the R statistical software with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 548 patients who underwent resection of their meningiomas, 66 met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen cases met the exclusion criteria (NF2, spinal location, previous surgical or radiation treatment, significant intra-osseous component and poor quality imaging). Forty-two grade I and 8 grade II meningiomas were included in the analysis. The VGR was significantly higher for grade II meningiomas. Using receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the optimal threshold that distinguishes between grade I and II meningiomas is 3 cm(3)/year. Higher histological grade, high initial tumour volume, MRI T2-signal hyperintensity and presence of oedema were found to be significant predictors of higher VGR. CONCLUSION: Reliable tools now exist to evaluate and monitor volumetric growth of meningiomas. Grade II meningiomas have significantly higher VGR compared with grade I meningiomas and growth of more than 3 cm(3)/year is strongly suggestive of a higher grade meningioma. A larger, multi-centre prospective study to investigate the applicability of velocity of growth to predict the outcome of patients with meningioma is warranted."

Epub 2017 Sep 8.,Haggart J,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,2017,2017/09/13,,,10.1016/j.jse.2017.06.036,"BACKGROUND: Larger glenosphere diameters have been used recently to increase prosthesis stability and impingement-free range of motion in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The goal of this study was to evaluate the rate of polyethylene wear for 32-mm and 40-mm glenospheres. METHODS: Glenospheres (32 mm and 40 mm, n = 6/group) and conventional polyethylene humeral liners underwent a 5-million cycle (MC) wear simulation protocol. Abduction-adduction and flexion-extension motion profiles were alternated every 250,000 cycles. At each interval, mass loss was determined and converted to volume loss and wear rate. At 0, 2.5 MC, and 5 MC, liners were imaged using micro-computed tomography to determine surface deviation. White light interferometry was performed on liners and glenospheres at 0 and 5 MC to quantify surface roughness. Wear particle morphology was characterized by environmental scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Total volume loss was significantly higher in 40-mm liners from 1.5 MC onward (P < .05). Overall, volumetric wear rate was significantly higher in 40-mm liners compared with 32-mm glenospheres (81.7 +/- 23.9 mm(3)/MC vs. 68.0 +/- 18.9 mm(3)/MC; P < .001). However, micro-computed tomography surface deviation results demonstrated increased linear penetration on 32-mm glenospheres compared with 40-mm glenospheres (0.36 +/- 0.03 microm vs. 0.28 +/- 0.01 microm; P = .002). Surface roughness measurements showed no difference for liners; however, increased roughness was noted for 40-mm glenospheres at 5 MC compared with 32 mm (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Larger glenospheres underwent significantly greater polyethylene volume loss and volumetric wear rates, whereas smaller glenospheres underwent greater polyethylene surface deviations. The enhanced stability provided by larger glenospheres must be weighed against the potential for increased polyethylene wear."

Discerning potential roles of AMPs in tumor pathogenesis may provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of novel AMP-based antitumor therapy. METHODS: mRNA expression of the AMPs alpha defensin (HNP-1); cathelicidin (LL-37); and beta defensins (hBD-1, hBD-2, hBD-3, hBD-4) in human uveal and cutaneous melanoma cell lines, primary human uveal melanocytes, and primary human uveal melanoma cells was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. An in vitro scratch assay and custom Matlab analysis were used to determine the AMP effects on melanoma cell migration. Last, the effect of specific AMPs on vasculogenic mimicry was determined by three-dimensional (3D) culture and light and fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Low-to-moderate AMP transcript levels were detected, and these varied across the cells tested. Overall, LL-37 expression was increased while hBD-4 was decreased in most melanoma cell lines, compared to primary cultured uveal melanocytes. There was no observable influence of HNP-1 and LL-37 on tumor cell migration. Additionally, aggressive cutaneous melanoma cells grown in 3D cultures exhibited vasculogenic mimicry, although AMP exposure did not alter this process. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data show that although AMP mRNA expression is variable between uveal and cutaneous melanoma cells, these peptides have little influence on major characteristics that contribute to tumor aggressiveness and progression."

Epub 2017 Aug 24.,Serin F,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2017,2017/09/27,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.08.010,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nuclei segmentation is a common process for quantitative analysis of histopathological images. However, this process generally results in overlapping of nuclei due to the nature of images, the sample preparation and staining, and image acquisition processes as well as insufficiency of 2D histopathological images to represent 3D characteristics of tissues. We present a novel algorithm to split overlapped nuclei. METHODS: The histopathological images are initially segmented by K-Means segmentation algorithm. Then, nuclei cluster are converted to binary image. The overlapping is detected by applying threshold area value to nuclei in the binary image. The splitting algorithm is applied to the overlapped nuclei. In first stage of splitting, circles are drawn on overlapped nuclei. The radius of the circles is calculated by using circle area formula, and each pixel's coordinates of overlapped nuclei are selected as center coordinates for each circle. The pixels in the circle that contains maximum number of intersected pixels in both the circle and the overlapped nuclei are removed from the overlapped nuclei, and the filled circle labeled as a nucleus. RESULTS: The algorithm has been tested on histopathological images of healthy and damaged kidney tissues and compared with the results provided by an expert and three related studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed splitting algorithm can segment the overlapping nuclei with accuracy of 84%. CONCLUSIONS: The study presents a novel algorithm splitting the overlapped nuclei in histopathological images and provides more accurate cell counting in histopathological analysis. Furthermore, the proposed splitting algorithm has the potential to be used in different fields to split any overlapped circular patterns."

Precise characterization of the CTF can expand our knowledge of various cellular processes as well as lead to the development of novel mechanical biomarkers. However, current methods that measure CTF require special substrates and fluorescent microscopy, rendering them less suitable in a clinical setting. Here, we demonstrate a rapid and direct approach to measure the combined CTF of a large cell population using thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cantilevers. Cells attached to the top surface of the PDMS cantilever produce CTF, which causes the cantilever to bend. The side view of the cantilever was imaged with a low-cost camera to extract the CTF. We characterized the CTF of fibroblasts and breast cancer cells. In addition, we were able to directly measure the contractile force of a suspended cell sheet, which is similar to the CTF of the confluent cell layer before detachment. The demonstrated technique can provide rapid and real-time measurement of the CTF of a large cell population and can directly characterize its temporal dynamics. The developed thin film PDMS cantilever can be fabricated affordably and the CTF extraction technique does not require expensive equipment. Thus, we believe that the developed method can provide an easy-to-use and affordable platform for CTF characterization in clinical settings and laboratories."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients with histopathologically proven EOC underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] with 11 b-values) using a 3.0T system and were divided into two groups: types I and II. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (f), distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC), and intravoxel water diffusion heterogeneity (alpha) histograms were obtained based on solid components of the entire tumor. The following metrics of each histogram were compared between two types: 1) mean; 2) median; 3) 10th percentile and 90th percentile. Conventional MRI morphological features were also recorded. RESULTS: Significant morphological features for predicting EOC type were maximum diameter (P = 0.007), texture of lesion (P = 0.001), and peritoneal implants (P = 0.001). For ADC, D, f, DDC, and alpha, all metrics were significantly lower in type II than type I (P < 0.05). Mean, median, 10th, and 90th percentile of D* were not significantly different (P = 0.336, 0.154, 0.779, and 0.203, respectively). Most histogram metrics of ADC, D, and DDC had significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values than those of f and alpha (P < 0.05) CONCLUSION: It is feasible to grade EOC by morphological features and three models with histogram analysis. ADC, D, and DDC have better performance than f and alpha; f and alpha may provide additional information. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2017;46:1797-1809."

There is at least some evidence for associations of cerebellar gray matter (GM) loss with motor and cognitive ability. We therefore correlated motor and cognitive ability scores (the multiple sclerosis functional composite MSFC) with regional cerebellar GM volumes. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess the regional GM volume loss in a cohort of 45 MS patients. For the regression analysis, we used the clinical subscores of the multiple sclerosis functional composite (25-ft walk test (T25FW), nine-hole peg test (9HPT), paced auditory serial addition task (PASAT)). Decreased GM in distinct cerebellar areas was associated with different subscores of the MSFC in Larsell's lobule VI with the T25FW (t = 5.16), in lobule IX with the 9HPT (t = 3.95), and in lobule IX with the PASAT (t = 4.81). Regional volume decrease in distinct cerebellar areas involved in motor and cognitive domains were associated with clinical impairment in these fields. Our data confirm the relationship between cerebellar GM volume loss and disability, extending the knowledge in the functional neuroanatomical perspective."

With the development of cell detection and segmentation techniques, it is possible to extract cell-level information for further analysis in pathology images. However, it is challenging to conduct efficient analysis of cell-level information on a large-scale image dataset because each image usually contains hundreds or thousands of cells. In this paper, we propose a novel image retrieval based framework for large-scale pathology image analysis. For each image, we encode each cell into binary codes to generate image representation using a novel graph based hashing model and then conduct image retrieval by applying a group-to-group matching method to similarity measurement. In order to improve both computational efficiency and memory requirement, we further introduce matrix factorization into the hashing model for scalable image retrieval. The proposed framework is extensively validated with thousands of lung cancer images, and it achieves 97.98% classification accuracy and 97.50% retrieval precision with all cells of each query image used."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 231 patients, who underwent FFDM and DBT (from which SM images were reconstructed) between September 2014-September 2015. The study included 250 suspicious breast lesions, all biopsy proven: 148 (59.2%) malignant and 13 (5.2%) high-risk lesions were confirmed by surgery, 89 (35.6%) benign lesions had radiological follow-up. Two breast radiologists, blinded to histology, independently reviewed all cases. Readings were performed with SM alone, then with FFDM, collecting data on: probability of malignancy for each finding, lesion conspicuity, mammographic features and dimensions of detected lesions. RESULTS: Agreement between readers was good for BI-RADS classification (Cohen's k-coefficient = 0.93 +/- 0.02) and for lesion dimension (Wilcoxon's p = 0.76). Visibility scores assigned to SM and FFDM for each lesion were similar for non-dense and dense breasts, however, there were significant differences (p = 0.0009) in distribution of mammographic features subgroups. SM and FFDM had similar sensitivities in non-dense (respectively 94 vs. 91%) and dense breasts (88 vs. 80%) and for all mammographic signs (93 vs. 87% for asymmetric densities, 96 vs. 75% for distortion, 92 vs. 85% for microcalcifications, and both 94% for masses). Based on all data, there was a significant difference in sensitivity for SM (92%) vs. FFDM (87%), p = 0.02, whereas the two modalities yielded similar results for specificity (SM: 60%, FFDM: 62%, p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: SM alone showed similar interpretive performance to FFDM, confirming its potential role as an alternative to FFDM in women having tomosynthesis, with the added advantage of halving the patient's dose exposure."

Epub 2017 Sep 23.,García-Martínez D,Am J Phys Anthropol,2017,2017/09/24,,,10.1002/ajpa.23313,"OBJECTIVES: First ribs bear information about thorax morphology and are usually well preserved, compared to other ribs, in bone/fossil samples. Several studies have addressed ontogeny of the first rib by studying changes in bone microanatomy and rib morphology separately, but no studies have combined both approaches to study how internal and external changes covary during ontogeny. The aim of this project is to fill this gap in our knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied 3D geometric morphometrics of sliding semilandmarks to 14 first ribs of Homo sapiens to quantify rib curvature and mid-shaft cross-section outline. Ontogenetic variation was addressed throughout a principal component analysis (PCA). Additionally, we made histological sections at the mid-shaft of the same ribs and studied tissue matrix composition and compartmentalization. Finally, we performed partial least squares (PLS) and regression analyses to study covariation between rib morphology and compartmentalization variables. RESULTS: PCA shows that first ribs increase their curvature over the course of ontogeny and the rib midshaft becomes less rounded during ontogeny. In addition, the sternal end becomes more medially oriented during ontogeny and the relative head-tubercle distance becomes longer. Compartmentalization shows a decrease in the area occupied by mineralized tissues and an increase in the area occupied by non-mineralized tissues over the course of ontogeny, which covaries with mid-shaft cross-section shape. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show detailed variation in rib morphology along with histological changes in bone tissue compartmentalization and, for the first time, the correlation between the two. This could be related to muscle attachments on the 1st rib and also to changes in breathing mode, from diaphragmatic in perinatals to pulmonary in adults, which could also have implications for understanding thorax evolution."

Knowledge of MVI status would help guide treatment recommendations, but is generally identified after operation. This study aims to predict MVI preoperatively using quantitative image analysis. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and twenty patients from 2 institutions underwent resection of HCC from 2003 to 2015 were included. The largest tumor from preoperative CT was subjected to quantitative image analysis, which uses an automated computer algorithm to capture regional variation in CT enhancement patterns. Quantitative imaging features by automatic analysis, qualitative radiographic descriptors by 2 radiologists, and preoperative clinical variables were included in multivariate analysis to predict histologic MVI. RESULTS: Histologic MVI was identified in 19 (37%) patients with tumors </=5 cm and 34 (49%) patients with tumors >5 cm. Among patients with tumors </=5 cm, none of the clinical findings or radiographic descriptors were associated with MVI; however, quantitative features based on angle co-occurrence matrix predicted MVI with an area under curve of 0.80, positive predictive value of 63%, and negative predictive value of 85%. In patients with tumors >5 cm, higher alpha-fetoprotein level, larger tumor size, and viral hepatitis history were associated with MVI, and radiographic descriptors were not. However, a multivariate model combining alpha-fetoprotein, tumor size, hepatitis status, and quantitative feature based on local binary pattern predicted MVI with area under curve of 0.88, positive predictive value of 72%, and negative predictive value of 96%. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the potential importance of quantitative image analysis as a predictor of MVI."

Although phosphorylated alpha-synuclein is believed to exert toxic effects at the synapse in dementia with Lewy bodies and other alpha-synucleinopathies, direct evidence for the precise synaptic localization has been difficult to achieve due to the lack of adequate optical microscopic resolution to study human synapses. In the present study we applied array tomography, a microscopy technique that combines ultrathin sectioning of tissue with immunofluorescence allowing precise identification of small structures, to quantitatively investigate the synaptic phosphorylated alpha-synuclein pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies. We performed array tomography on human brain samples from five patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, five patients with Alzheimer's disease and five healthy control subjects to analyse the presence of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity at the synapse and their relationship with synapse size. Main analyses were performed in blocks from cingulate cortex and confirmed in blocks from the striatum of cases with dementia with Lewy bodies. A total of 1 318 700 single pre- or postsynaptic terminals were analysed. We found that phosphorylated alpha-synuclein is present exclusively in dementia with Lewy bodies cases, where it can be identified in the form of Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites and small aggregates (<0.16 microm3). Between 19% and 25% of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein deposits were found in presynaptic terminals mainly in the form of small aggregates. Synaptic terminals that co-localized with small aggregates of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein were significantly larger than those that did not. Finally, a gradient of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein aggregation in synapses (pre > pre + post > postsynaptic) was observed. These results indicate that phosphorylated alpha-synuclein is found at the presynaptic terminals of dementia with Lewy bodies cases mainly in the form of small phosphorylated alpha-synuclein aggregates that are associated with changes in synaptic morphology. Overall, our data support the notion that pathological phosphorylated alpha-synuclein may disrupt the structure and function of the synapse in dementia with Lewy bodies."

Here, we introduce a simple, non-destructive slide-free technique that, within minutes, provides high-resolution diagnostic histological images resembling those obtained from conventional haematoxylin and eosin histology. The approach, which we named microscopy with ultraviolet surface excitation (MUSE), can also generate shape and colour-contrast information. MUSE relies on ~280 nm ultraviolet light to restrict the excitation of conventional fluorescent stains to tissue surfaces and it has no significant effects on downstream molecular assays (including fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing). MUSE promises to improve the speed and efficiency of patient care in both state-of-the-art and low-resource settings and to provide opportunities for rapid histology in research."

In the case of colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRA), grading is partly determined by morphology and degree of formation of glandular structures. Achieving consistency between pathologists is difficult due to the subjective nature of grading assessment. An objective grading using computer algorithms will be more consistent, and will be able to analyse images in more detail. In this paper, we measure the shape of glands with a novel metric that we call the Best Alignment Metric (BAM). We show a strong correlation between a novel measure of glandular shape and grade of the tumour. We used shape specific parameters to perform a two-class classification of images into normal or cancerous tissue and a three-class classification into normal, low grade cancer, and high grade cancer. The task of detecting gland boundaries, which is a prerequisite of shape-based analysis, was carried out using a deep convolutional neural network designed for segmentation of glandular structures. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained using shape features derived from BAM. Through cross-validation, we achieved an accuracy of 97% for the two-class and 91% for three-class classification."

Data from non-human primate histology shows that connections between lower to higher areas (e.g. retina-->V1), and between higher to lower areas (e.g. V1<--V2) can be dissociated based upon the distribution of afferent synapses at the laminar level. Ultra-high field scanners opened up the possibility to image brain structure and function at an unprecedented level of detail. Taking advantage of the increased spatial resolution available, it could theoretically be possible to disentangle activity from different cortical depths from human cerebral cortex, separately studying different compartments across depth. Here we use half-millimeter human functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, MRI) to derive laminar profiles in early visual cortex using a paradigm known to elicit two separate responses originating from an excitatory and a suppressive source, avoiding any contamination due to blood-stealing. We report the shape of laminar blood level oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) profiles from the excitatory and suppressive conditions. We analyse positive and negative %BOLD laminar profiles with respect to the dominating linear trend towards the pial surface, a confounding feature of gradient echo BOLD fMRI, and examine the correspondence with the anatomical landmark of input-related signals in primary visual cortex, the stria of Gennari."

Obviously, the formation of the layers and their composition is essential to cognition and behavior. The layers were traditionally measured by histological means but recent studies utilizing MRI suggested that T1 relaxation imaging consist of enough contrast to separate the layers. Indeed extreme resolution, post mortem, studies demonstrated this phenomenon. Yet, one of the limiting factors of using T1 MRI to visualize the layers in neuroimaging research is partial volume effect. This happen when the image resolution is not high enough and two or more layers resides within the same voxel. In this paper we demonstrate that due to the physical small thickness of the layers it is highly unlikely that high resolution imaging could resolve the layers. By contrast, we suggest that low resolution multi T1 mapping conjugate with composition analysis could provide practical means for measuring the T1 layers. We suggest an acquisition platform that is clinically feasible and could quantify measures of the layers. The key feature of the suggested platform is that separation of the layers is better achieved in the T1 relaxation domain rather than in the spatial image domain."

This method showed superior abilities to detect the nucleus regions and to split the boundaries of connected nuclei. Our experiments show higher scores in comparison with five other techniques in terms of eight evaluation metrics."

Epub 2017 Jun 2.,Giuliani A,Clin Oral Investig,2018,2017/06/04,,,10.1007/s00784-017-2139-6,"OBJECTIVES: Recently, it has been reported that heterologous biomaterials, where the collagen matrix is preserved, seem to facilitate blood clotting and the subsequent invasion of repairing and regenerative cells. This study aimed at evaluating the healing of human extraction sockets grafted with a collagenated cortico-cancellous porcine bone (mp3(R), OsteoBiol(R), Tecnoss(R), Giaveno, Italy) by synchrotron radiation X-ray microtomography (microCT) and histology in order to have a 3D quantitative characterization over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ridge preservation with porcine bone and collagen membrane was performed on 21 patients using a flapless approach and a secondary soft tissue closure. At the time of implant placement, six bone samples were harvested, two in the 3-month group, two in the 6-month group, one in the 12-month group post-surgery, and one spontaneously healed control, and evaluated by microCT and histology. RESULTS: MicroCT revealed that in the grafted sites there were a greater number of trabeculae, although they appeared thinner than in the control sites; these trabeculae homogenously filled the defects, suggesting an improved strength of the socket. Histology showed that over time, the amount of biomaterial decreased and the newly formed bone increased, while less dense bone with wider marrow spaces was detected in the control sample, supporting synchrotron findings. CONCLUSIONS: The morphometric data converge to indicate the suitability of porcine bone for the preservation of post-extraction sockets. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of mp3 is encouraged to preserve and heal sockets."

In this work an approach for analysing abnormality based on textural features present in squamous cell carcinoma histological slides have been considered. Histogram and grey-level co-occurrence matrix approaches for extraction of textural features from biopsy images with normal and malignant cells are used here. Further, we have used linear support vector machine classifier for automated diagnosis of the oral cancer, which gives 100% accuracy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicenter, two-arm, observational, cross-sectional study that recruited women 21 years and older, having colposcopy after a low-grade abnormality screening result. The prospective arm collected outcomes of digital colposcopy with DSI used for identifying biopsy sites at the colposcopists' discretion. The retrospective control arm (number of subjects matched 1:1 per colposcopist) collected outcomes of standard colposcopy. The primary outcome was histopathological detection of women with CIN 2+ by colposcopic biopsy. RESULTS: The study included 1,788 women in the retrospective and 1,857 in the prospective arm from 39 US community-based clinics. Subject characteristics were comparable. A total of 71.6% of the women in the retrospective and 71.5% in the prospective arm underwent biopsy. The average number of biopsies increased from 1.032 (retrospective) to 1.256 (prospective). The yield of CIN 2+ patients was 7.21% in the retrospective and 9.48% in the prospective arm, a 2.27% difference (95% confidence interval = 0.47%-4.07%, p = .014) and 31.4% relative increase. The yield of CIN 3+ patients was 2.07% in the retrospective and 3.23% in the prospective arm, a 1.16% (95% confidence interval = 0.12%-2.24%, p = .031) absolute difference and 56.1% relative increase. The false-positive rates for biopsied patients were comparable (64.43% vs 62.04%, p = .139). CONCLUSIONS: Digital colposcopy with the adjunctive DSI increased CIN 2+ and CIN 3+ detection in low-grade referrals compared with standard colposcopy, with a similar number of women undergoing biopsy."

METHODS: Forty-three eyes with high myopia and thin corneas were enrolled. All eyes underwent SMILE procedure. After the lenticule was extracted, 0.25% riboflavin was injected into the interface and allowed to diffuse for 60 s. The eye was irradiated with UVA radiation of 30 mW/cm(2) for 90 s through the cap. The total energy delivered was 2.7 J/cm(2). Morphologic modifications of corneal architecture were evaluated prior to SMILE Xtra and 7 days, 1, 3, and 6 months after SMILE by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and 3D-OCT. RESULTS: The corneal epithelial cells showed slight damage until 3 months postoperatively. The subepithelial nerve plexus decreased but no absence within the treatment zone at the first week after treatment, recolonized at 3 months postoperatively, and had mostly recovered at the 6 months postoperative but remained less than its normal baseline state. Keratocytes were absent in the surgical interface area, and the presence of strong reflective particles and cicatricial reaction in the anterior stroma were observed during the entire 6-month examination period. Increased hyperreflectivity was observed from the cap side at a depth of 60 microm to stroma bed at a depth of 388 microm through 6 months. The depth of the demarcation line in 40 eyes (93.0%) was at a mean depth of 296.12 +/- 47.86 mum (range, 211-388 mum). No particular change between preoperative and postoperative corneal endothelium was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Confocal microscopy showed increased hyperreflectivity in the SMILE Xtra eyes, and no changes in corneal endothelium. We confirmed the safety of the SMILE Xtra but recognize that larger and longer-term studies of SMILE Xtra are necessary."

Epub 2017 Oct 25.,Brachetta-Aporta N,J Anat,2018,2017/10/27,PMC5735055,,10.1111/joa.12716,"Bone size and shape arise throughout ontogeny as a result of the coordinated activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, responsible for bone deposition and resorption, and growth displacements. The modelling processes leave specific microstructural features on the bone surface, which can be used to infer the mechanisms shaping craniofacial traits in extinct and extant species. However, the analysis of bone surfaces from fossils and archaeological samples faces some difficulties related to the bone loss caused by taphonomic factors, and the lack of formal methods for estimating missing information and comparing the patterns of bone modelling among several specimens and samples. The present study provides a new approach for the quantitative analysis of bone formation and resorption patterns obtained from craniofacial surfaces. First, interpolation techniques were used to estimate missing data on high-resolution replicas of the left maxilla in a sample of sub-adult and adult modern humans and sub-adult fossil hominins. The performance of this approach was assessed by simulating variable amounts of missing data. Then, we applied measures of dispersion and central tendency to represent the variation and average pattern of bone modelling within samples. The spatial interpolation resulted in reliable estimations of the type of cell activity (deposition or resorption) in the missing areas, even when large extensions of the bone surface were lost. The quantification of the histological data allowed us to integrate the information of different specimens and depict the areas with higher and lower variation in the bone modelling pattern of the maxilla among specimens. Overall, the main advantages of the quantitative approach used here for generating bone modelling patterns are the high replicability and the possibility of incorporating variation among specimens into the comparisons among samples."

We introduce an initial version of a geometrical screening method that uses the skeleton of the cryo-EM images to evaluate candidate structures. The aim of this method is to reduce the number of native-like candidate conformations and, therefore, reduce the time required for structural evaluation by energy calculations. A test of two datasets was performed. The first dataset contains 10 proteins and shows that our method can successfully detect the correct native structure for the given skeleton among a set of different protein structures. The second dataset contains 12 proteins and shows that our method can filter slightly modified decoy conformations of the same protein. The efficiency of the method is also reported."

We have previously described step-by-step protocols to generate immortalized cell lines stably expressing ASC fused to a fluorescent protein for measuring inflammasome activation by confocal microscopy, and immunofluorescence of endogenous ASC in primary cells. Here, we present two more methods to detect ASC speck formation: (1) Assessment of ASC speck formation by flow cytometry; and (2) Chemical cross-linking of ASC followed by immunoblotting. These methods allow for the discrimination of inflammasome-activated versus non-activated cells, the identification of lineage-specific inflammasome activation in complex cell mixtures, and sorting of inflammasome-activated cells for further analysis."

With intracranial vessel wall imaging, vessel wall characteristics have tentatively been described for atherosclerosis, vasculitis, dissections, Moyamoya disease, and aneurysms. With the increasing demand and subsequently increased use of intracranial vessel wall imaging in clinical practice, radiologists should be aware of the choices in imaging parameters and how they affect image quality, the clinical indications, methods of assessment, and limitations in the interpretation of these images. In this How I do It article, the authors will discuss the technical requirements and considerations for vessel wall image acquisition in general, describe their own vessel wall imaging protocol at 3 T and 7 T, show a step-by-step basic assessment of intracranial vessel wall imaging as performed at their institution-including commonly encountered artifacts and pitfalls-and summarize the commonly reported imaging characteristics of various intracranial vessel wall diseases for direct clinical applicability.

Epub 2017 Dec 5.,Patel BK,Eur J Radiol,2018,2017/12/28,,,10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.11.024,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the use of a computer-aided diagnosis-contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CAD-CESM) tool can further increase the diagnostic performance of CESM compared with that of experienced radiologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This IRB-approved retrospective study analyzed 50 lesions described on CESM from August 2014 to December 2015. Histopathologic analyses, used as the criterion standard, revealed 24 benign and 26 malignant lesions. An expert breast radiologist manually outlined lesion boundaries on the different views. A set of morphologic and textural features were then extracted from the low-energy and recombined images. Machine-learning algorithms with feature selection were used along with statistical analysis to reduce, select, and combine features. Selected features were then used to construct a predictive model using a support vector machine (SVM) classification method in a leave-one-out-cross-validation approach. The classification performance was compared against the diagnostic predictions of 2 breast radiologists with access to the same CESM cases. RESULTS: Based on the SVM classification, CAD-CESM correctly identified 45 of 50 lesions in the cohort, resulting in an overall accuracy of 90%. The detection rate for the malignant group was 88% (3 false-negative cases) and 92% for the benign group (2 false-positive cases). Compared with the model, radiologist 1 had an overall accuracy of 78% and a detection rate of 92% (2 false-negative cases) for the malignant group and 62% (10 false-positive cases) for the benign group. Radiologist 2 had an overall accuracy of 86% and a detection rate of 100% for the malignant group and 71% (8 false-positive cases) for the benign group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our feasibility study suggest that a CAD-CESM tool can provide complementary information to radiologists, mainly by reducing the number of false-positive findings."

SETTING: McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Thirty-five pseudophakic eyes and 25 phakic eyes were sectioned and converted into digital slides. The total trabecular meshwork area and the ciliary body stroma were demarcated. The area of the trabecular meshwork, cellular and noncellular trabecular meshwork compartments, trabecular space, distance from scleral spur to inner uveal trabecular portion, and degree of fibrosis of the ciliary processes were evaluated. RESULTS: The trabecular meshwork area was larger in the pseudophakic group than the phakic group (P = .03). Furthermore, a trend of larger trabecular space recorded was seen in the pseudophakic group than the phakic group (P = .14). No differences in the proportion of cellular (P = .88) and noncellular trabecular meshwork compartments (P = .4) were seen between groups. The scleral spur to inner uveal trabecular portion distance was longer in the pseudophakic group than the phakic group (P = .008) and correlate with the trabecular meshwork area (P = .0001, r = 0.56). In the ciliary processes, a higher degree of fibrosis was measured in the pseudophakic group than the phakic group (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: There were significant histopathological changes in the trabecular meshwork and higher fibrosis in the ciliary processes in pseudophakic eyes compared with phakic eyes. These findings support the hypothesis that trabecular meshwork remodeling after cataract surgery is involved in lowering intraocular pressure."

RAGE signals through Diaphanous-1 (DIAPH1); however, the expression of DIAPH1 in the healthy and AD human brain has yet to be methodically addressed. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the cell- and disease-state specific expression of DIAPH1 in the human medial temporal cortex during healthy aging and AD. METHODS: We used semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry in the human medial temporal cortex paired with widefield and confocal microscopy and automated analyses to determine colocalization and relative expression of DIAPH1 with key cell markers and molecules in the brains of subjects with AD versus age-matched controls. RESULTS: We report robust colocalization of DIAPH1 with myeloid cells and increased expression during AD, which strongly correlated to increased neutral lipids and morphology of inflamed myeloid cells. DIAPH1 moderately colocalized with markers of endothelial cells, astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. DISCUSSION: Our findings localize DIAPH1 particularly to myeloid cells in the CNS, especially in AD in the locations of lipid droplet accumulation, thereby implicating RAGE-DIAPH1 signaling in dysregulated lipid metabolism and morphological changes of inflamed myeloid cells in this disorder."

The first of them represents a compound of components of different origin, structure, location, and complexity of spatial organization. Their stereomorphology and microanatomical interrelations remain understudied for a number of reasons. The aim: The objective of the research was to study the stereomorphological features of the glandular component of the peripheral zone of the prostate in view of its zonal structure concept. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The material for the study was the glandular zone of the human prostate, which corresponds to the peripheral zone of the prostate according to the classification (Mc.Neal J.E., 1988). The following methods were used in the study: histological (4 mkm thick paraffin sections), microscopic (light microscopy using the Olympus BX-41 microscope), stereomorphological (obtaining waxed model reconstructions based on graphic ones). The study was conducted on 10 isolated prostate preparations (10 series of 50 preparations in each) taken from the deceased men without changes in the organ under investigation. The prostate gland was fixed in a 10% solution of buffered formalin, followed by obtaining serial plane-parallel sections and staining with hematoxylin and eosin according to the conventional technique. RESULTS: Results and conclusions: The ducts of the glands of the peripheral zone of the human prostate normally have recurrent luminal dilatations, which, like the multi-cavity terminal portions, can serve as a place for depositing a secret. The ducts of the peripheral zone glands, with the exception of the main duct, visually differ little in diameter. Their walls and walls of intra-acinar cavities are lined with homologous epithelial cells. Therefore, there is no clear morphological boundary between the transfer of the terminal portion to the duct and from one excretory duct to the other."

Both carotenoids demonstrated cytotoxicity with respect to cancer cells but not to normal cells. Cells from both the cell lines were analyzed with application of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and Raman scattering microscopy. Both imaging techniques show effective incorporation of carotenoid molecules into growing cells. Comparison of the Raman scattering and fluorescence lifetime characteristics reveals different molecular organization of carotenoids in the carcinoma and normal cells. The main difference consists in a carotenoid aggregation level which is substantially lower in the carcinoma cells as compared to the normal cells. Different molecular organization of carotenoids was interpreted in terms of a different metabolism of normal and carcinoma cells and has been concluded to provide a possibility of cancer diagnosis based on spectroscopic analyses."

To explore whether mice display human-like fat depots in anatomically comparable regions, we mapped fat depots using glucose or fatty acid imaging tracers, such as (18)F-FDG through PET/CT or [(123/125)I]-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid with SPECT/CT imaging, to analogous depots in mice. Using this type of image analysis with both probes, we define a large number of additional areas of high metabolic activity corresponding to novel fat pads. Histological and gene expression analyses validate these regions as bona fide fat pads. Our findings indicate that fat depots of rodents show a high degree of topological similarity to those of humans. Studies involving both glucose and lipid tracers indicate differential preferences for these substrates in different depots and also suggest that fatty acid-based visualized approaches may reveal additional brown adipose tissue and beige depots in humans."

Thirty-nine consecutive NPC patients with a total of 40 enlarged, biopsied PLNs underwent DWI examination. ADC values for benign and malignant PLNs were measured and compared. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was to evaluate the optimal threshold level of ADC values for metastatic PLNs. The kappa was to assess the degree of agreement between histopathological diagnoses and ADC values, or imaging features of PLNs on MRI. We found the mean ADC value for benign PLNs was markedly higher than malignant PLNs. A threshold ADC of 1.01 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s was associated with a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 72.7% (area under the curve: 0.84). A moderate agreement was observed between the histopathological diagnosis and the threshold of ADC value (k value: 0.483). However, short axis diameter, necrosis, extranodal extension, and regional grouping of PLNs on MRI showed only a fair agreement with the histopathological diagnosis (k value: 0.257, 0.305, 0.276, and 0.205, respectively). Therefore, DWI may be a promising technique to differentiate metastatic from benign PLNs."

Techniques to assess and quantitate NETosis in an unbiased, reproducible, and efficient way are lacking, considerably limiting the advancement of research in this field. We optimized and validated, a new method to automatically quantify the percentage of neutrophils undergoing NETosis in real time using the IncuCyte ZOOM imaging platform and the membrane-permeability properties of two DNA dyes. Neutrophils undergoing NETosis induced by various physiological stimuli showed distinct changes, with a loss of multilobulated nuclei, as well as nuclear decondensation followed by membrane compromise, and were accurately counted by applying filters based on fluorescence intensity and nuclear size. Findings were confirmed and validated with the established method of immunofluorescence microscopy. The platform was also validated to rapidly assess and quantify the dose-dependent effect of inhibitors of NETosis. In addition, this method was able to distinguish among neutrophils undergoing NETosis, apoptosis, or necrosis based on distinct changes in nuclear morphology and membrane integrity.

However, the donor tissue size is limited and the complications related to these surgical techniques lead to morbidities, often involving the donor sites. Alternatively, recent reports indicated that extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds boost the regenerative potential of the injured site, as shown in a small cohort of volumetric muscle loss patients. Perfusion decellularization is a bioengineering technology that allows the generation of clinical-scale ECM scaffolds with preserved complex architecture and with an intact vascular template, from a variety of donor organs and tissues. We recently reported that this technology is amenable to generate full composite tissue scaffolds from rat and non-human primate limbs. Translating this platform to human extremities could substantially benefit soft tissue and volumetric muscle loss patients providing tissue- and species-specific grafts. In this proof-of-concept study, we show the successful generation a large-scale, acellular composite tissue scaffold from a full cadaveric human upper extremity. This construct retained its morphological architecture and perfusable vascular conduits. Histological and biochemical validation confirmed the successful removal of nuclear and cellular components, and highlighted the preservation of the native extracellular matrix components. Our results indicate that perfusion decellularization can be applied to produce human composite tissue acellular scaffolds. With its preserved structure and vascular template, these biocompatible constructs, could have significant advantages over the currently implanted matrices by means of nutrient distribution, size-scalability and immunological response."

METHOD: ighty-five patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent total mesorectal excision of the rectum were studied. A total of 273 lymph nodes were harvested and subjected to histological analysis. Quantitative parameters [apparent diffusion parameter D(app) of the Gaussian distribution, apparent kurtosis coefficient K(app) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)] of lymph nodes were derived from DKI. Differences and the diagnostic performance of these parameters were calculated by using the independent-samples t test and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. RESULTS: The median D(app) and ADC values of metastatic lymph nodes were significantly greater than those of benign lymph nodes, whereas the median K(app) of metastatic lymph nodes was statistically less than that of normal lymph nodes. D(app) had the relatively highest area under the curve of 0.774. When 1126.15 x 10(-6)  mm(2) /s was used as a D(app) threshold value, the sensitivity and specificity were 96.97% and 41.82%, respectively. CONCLUSION: DKI can help differentiate metastatic vs benign lymph nodes during the primary staging of rectal cancer."

Epub 2017 Sep 1.,Fincham GS,Ophthalmology,2018,2017/09/05,,,10.1016/j.ophtha.2017.08.001,"PURPOSE: Despite posterior vitreous detachment being a common ocular event affecting most individuals in an aging population, there is little consensus regarding its precise anatomic definition. We investigated the morphologic appearance and molecular composition of the posterior hyaloid membrane to determine whether the structure clinically observed enveloping the posterior vitreous surface after posterior vitreous detachment is a true basement membrane and to postulate its origin. Understanding the relationship between the vitreous (in both its attached and detached state) and the internal limiting membrane of the retina is essential to understanding the cause of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and vitreoretinal interface disorders, as well as potential future prophylactic and treatment strategies. DESIGN: Clinicohistologic correlation study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six human donor globes. METHODS: Vitreous bodies identified to have posterior vitreous detachment were examined with phase-contrast microscopy and confocal microscopy after immunohistochemically staining for collagen IV basement membrane markers, in addition to extracellular proteins that characterize the vitreoretinal junction (fibronectin, laminin) and vitreous gel (opticin) markers. The posterior retina similarly was stained to evaluate the internal limiting membrane. Findings were correlated to the clinical appearance of the posterior hyaloid membrane observed during slit-lamp biomicroscopy after posterior vitreous detachment and compared with previously published studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Morphologic appearance and molecular composition of the posterior hyaloid membrane. RESULTS: Phase-contrast microscopy consistently identified a creased and distinct glassy membranous sheet enveloping the posterior vitreous surface, correlating closely with the posterior hyaloid membrane observed during slit-lamp biomicroscopy in patients with posterior vitreous detachment. Immunofluorescent confocal micrographs demonstrated the enveloping membranous structure identified on phase-contrast microscopy to show positive stain results for type IV collagen. Immunofluorescence of the residual intact internal limiting membrane on the retinal surface also showed positive stain results for type IV collagen. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide immunohistochemical evidence that the posterior hyaloid membrane is a true basement membrane enveloping the posterior hyaloid surface. Because this membranous structure is observed only after posterior vitreous detachment, the results of this study indicate that it forms part of the internal limiting membrane when the vitreous is in its attached state."

However, available technologies face a common challenge, especially when it comes to the unmet need for unraveling population heterogeneity at single-cell precision: higher imaging resolution (and thus content) comes at the expense of lower throughput, or vice versa. To overcome this challenge, a new type of imaging flow cytometer based upon an all-optical ultrafast laser-scanning imaging technique, called free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay (FACED) is reported. It enables an imaging throughput (>20 000 cells s(-1) ) 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the camera-based imaging flow cytometers. It also has 2 critical advantages over optical time-stretch imaging flow cytometry, which achieves a similar throughput: (1) it is widely compatible to the repertoire of biochemical contrast agents, favoring biomolecular-specific cellular assay and (2) it enables high-throughput visualization of functional morphology of individual cells with subcellular resolution. These capabilities enable multiparametric single-cell image analysis which reveals cellular heterogeneity, for example, in the cell-death processes demonstrated in this work-the information generally masked in non-imaging flow cytometry. Therefore, this platform empowers not only efficient large-scale single-cell measurements, but also detailed mechanistic analysis of complex cellular processes."

Our method offers high precision (>90%) and reasonable recall (>70%) for glomeruli from WSIs, is readily adaptable to glomeruli from multiple species, including mouse, rat, and human, and is robust to diverse slide staining methods. Using 5 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPUs with 40 GB RAM, our method typically requires ~15 sec for training and ~2 min to extract glomeruli reproducibly from a WSI. Deploying a deep convolutional neural network trained for glomerular recognition in tandem with the SVM suffices to reduce false positives to below 3%. We also apply our LBP-based descriptor to successfully detect pathologic changes in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy. We envision potential clinical and laboratory applications for this approach in the study and diagnosis of glomerular disease, and as a means of greatly accelerating the construction of feature sets to fuel deep learning studies into tissue structure and pathology."

We examined the association of alcohol consumption with brain white matter health in 377 middle-aged men (56-66 years old; mean 61.8 +/- 2.6 years) who were participants in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). T1-, T2-, proton density-, and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained. Diffusion measures were quantified from 12 major white matter tracts. Global white matter lesion (WML) burden was also quantified. Mixed effects linear models examined differences in diffusivity and WMLs by amount of alcohol intake. Analyses adjusted for numerous demographic, health, and lifestyle variables. An inverted-U association was found between alcohol intake and fractional anisotropy (FA) in several tracts, including the inferior-frontal-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, the forceps minor and the anterior thalamic radiations. In these tracts, FA increased with increasing alcohol intake, peaking with moderate alcohol intake (9-28 drinks in 14 days), and declining with heavier intake. Associations remained significant after exclusion of individuals with diabetes or hypertension. There was a U-shaped association in WML burden with highest burden among never drinkers and heavy drinkers (>28 drinks in 14 days). This association was no longer significant after exclusion of individuals with hypertension, since WML burden among heavy drinkers no longer differed from that of other drinkers. This suggests that hypertension related to heavy alcohol intake may contribute to WML burden observed among heavy drinkers. Together, these correlational results suggest that among middle-aged men, moderate drinking may be associated with metrics of better white matter health, particularly microstructural measures, whereas drinking beyond recommended guidelines may be associated with both microstructural and macrostructural white matter damage."

Epub 2017 Nov 23.,DeKraker J,Neuroimage,2018,2017/11/28,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.054,"The hippocampus, like the neocortex, has a morphological structure that is complex and variable in its folding pattern, especially in the hippocampal head. The current study presents a computational method to unfold hippocampal grey matter, with a particular focus on the hippocampal head where complexity is highest due to medial curving of the structure and the variable presence of digitations. This unfolding was performed on segmentations from high-resolution, T2-weighted 7T MRI data from 12 healthy participants and one surgical patient with epilepsy whose resected hippocampal tissue was used for histological validation. We traced a critical image feature composed of the hippocampal sulcus and stratum radiatum lacunosum-moleculare, (SRLM) in these images, then employed user-guided semi-automated techniques to detect and subsequently unfold the surrounding hippocampal grey matter. This unfolding was performed by solving Laplace's equation in three dimensions of interest (long-axis, proximal-distal, and laminar). The resulting 'unfolded coordinate space' provides an intuitive way of mapping the hippocampal subfields in 2D space (long-axis and proximal-distal), such that similar borders can be applied in the head, body, and tail of the hippocampus independently of variability in folding. This unfolded coordinate space was employed to map intracortical myelin and thickness in relation to subfield borders, which revealed intracortical myelin differences that closely follow the subfield borders used here. Examination of a histological resected tissue sample from a patient with epilepsy reveals that our unfolded coordinate system has biological validity, and that subfield segmentations applied in this space are able to capture features not seen in manual tracing protocols."

The aim of this study is to evaluate which Haralick's features are the most feasible in predicting tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After MRI and histological assessment, eight patients were enrolled and divided into two groups based on response to neoadjuvant CRT in complete responders (CR) and non-responders (NR). Oblique Axial T2-weighted MRI sequences before CRT were analyzed by two radiologists in consensus drawing a ROI around the tumor. 14 over 192 Haralick's features were extrapolated from normalized gray-level co-occurrence matrix in four different directions. A dedicated statistical analysis was performed to evaluate distribution of the extracted Haralick's features computing mean and standard deviation. RESULTS: Pretreatment MRI examination showed significant value (p < 0.05) of 5 over 14 computed Haralick texture. In particular, the significant features are the following: concerning energy, contrast, correlation, entropy and inverse difference moment. CONCLUSIONS: Five Haralick's features showed significant relevance in the prediction of response to therapy in colorectal cancer and might be used as additional imaging biomarker in the oncologic management of colorectal patients."

In order to compare these measurements across a relatively wide range of myelin concentrations, whole-brain T(1) w magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE), T(2) w FSE and three-dimensional multi-echo GRASE data were acquired from 10 participants with multiple sclerosis at 3 T. Then, after high-dimensional, non-linear warping, region of interest (ROI) analyses were performed to compare T(1) w/T(2) w ratios and MWF estimates (across participants and brain regions) in 11 bilateral white matter (WM) and four bilateral subcortical grey matter (SGM) structures extracted from the JHU_MNI_SS 'Eve' atlas. Although the GRASE sequence systematically underestimated T(1) w/T(2) w values compared to the FSE sequence (revealed by Bland-Altman and mountain plots), linear regressions across participants and ROIs revealed consistently high correlations between the two methods (r(2) = 0.62 for all ROIs, r(2) = 0.62 for WM structures and r(2) = 0.73 for SGM structures). However, correlations between either FSE-based or GRASE-based T(1) w/T(2) w ratios and MWFs were extremely low in WM structures (FSE-based, r(2) = 0.000020; GRASE-based, r(2) = 0.0014), low across all ROIs (FSE-based, r(2) = 0.053; GRASE-based, r(2) = 0.029) and moderate in SGM structures (FSE-based, r(2) = 0.20; GRASE-based, r(2) = 0.17). Overall, our findings indicated a high degree of correlation (but not equivalence) between FSE-based and GRASE-based T(1) w/T(2) w ratios, and low correlations between T(1) w/T(2) w ratios and MWFs. This suggests that the two T(1) w/T(2) w ratio approaches measure similar facets of subcortical tissue microstructure, whereas T(1) w/T(2) w ratios and MWFs appear to be sensitized to different microstructural properties. On this basis, we conclude that multi-echo GRASE sequences can be used in future studies to efficiently elucidate both general (T(1) w/T(2) w ratio) and myelin-specific (MWF) tissue characteristics."

One of the serious parasitic diseases affecting the liver tissues is schistosomiasis. Immunologic reactions to Schistosoma eggs leads to accumulation of collagen in the hepatic parenchyma causing fibrosis. Thus, monitoring and reporting the staging of the histopathological information related to liver fibrosis are essential for accurate diagnosis and therapy of the chronic liver diseases. Automated assessment of the microscopic liver tissue images is an essential process. For accurate and timeless assessment, an automated image analysis and classification of different stages of fibrosis can be employed as an efficient procedure. In this work, granuloma stages, namely cellular, fibrocellular, and fibrotic granulomas along with normal liver samples were classified after features extraction. In this work, a new hybrid combination of statistical features with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is proposed. These combined features are further classified using the back-propagation neural network (BPNN). A comparative study of the used classifier with the support vector machine is also conducted. The comparative results established that the BPNN achieved superior accuracy of 98.3% compared to the linear SVM, quadratic SVM, and cubic SVM that provided 85%, 84%, and 80%; respectively. In conclusion, this work is of special value that provides promising results for early prediction of the liver fibrosis in schistosomiais and other fibrotic liver diseases in no time with expected better prognosis after treatment."

However, such cells are exceedingly difficult to detect from blood or biopsy samples at the disease onset. It is reported that cancer cells, and especially metastatic tumor cells, show very distinctive morphological behavior compared to their healthy counterparts on aptamer functionalized substrates. The ability to quickly analyze the data and quantify the cell morphology for an instant real-time feedback can certainly contribute to early cancer diagnosis. A supervised machine learning approach is presented for identification and classification of cancer cell gestures for early diagnosis. METHODS: We quantified the morphologically distinct behavior of metastatic cells and their healthy counterparts captured on aptamer-functionalized glass substrates from time-lapse optical micrographs. As a proof of concept, the morphologies of human glioblastoma (hGBM) and astrocyte cells were used. The cells were captured and imaged with an optical microscope. Multiple feature vectors were extracted to quantify and differentiate the complex physical gestures of cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Three different classifier models, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Tree (RFT), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) were trained with the known dataset using machine learning algorithms. The performances of the classifiers were compared for accuracy, precision, and recall measurements using five-fold cross-validation technique. RESULTS: All the classifier models detected the cancer cells with an average accuracy of at least 82%. The NBC performed the best among the three classifiers in terms of Precision (0.91), Recall (0.9), and F(1)-score (0.89) for the existing dataset. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a standalone system built on machine learning techniques for cancer screening based on cell gestures. The system offers rapid, efficient, and novel identification of hGBM brain tumor cells and can be extended to define single cell analysis metrics for many other types of tumor cells."

In this contribution, it has been presented an image processing software, Python based image analysis for cell growth (PIACG), that is able to calculate the total area of the well occupied by cells with fusiform and rounded morphology in response to different concentrations of fetal bovine serum in microfluidic chips, from microscopy images in transmission light, in a highly efficient way."

In practice, pathologists rely on color, which reflects the presence of specific tissue components, to establish a diagnosis. Similarly, automatic histopathology image analysis algorithms rely on color or intensity measures to extract tissue features. With the increasing access to digitized histopathology images, color variation and its implications have become a critical issue. These variations are the result of not only a variety of factors involved in the preparation of tissue slides but also in the digitization process itself. Consequently, different strategies have been proposed to alleviate stain-related tissue inconsistencies in automatic image analysis systems. Such techniques generally rely on collecting color statistics to perform color matching across images. In this work, we propose a different approach for stain normalization that we refer to as stain transfer. We design a discriminative image analysis model equipped with a stain normalization component that transfers stains across datasets. Our model comprises a generative network that learns data set-specific staining properties and image-specific color transformations as well as a task-specific network (e.g., classifier or segmentation network). The model is trained end-to-end using a multi-objective cost function. We evaluate the proposed approach in the context of automatic histopathology image analysis on three data sets and two different analysis tasks: tissue segmentation and classification. The proposed method achieves superior results in terms of accuracy and quality of normalized images compared to various baselines."

Very little is known about what other types of immune cells exist in the infiltrates mainly located in the portal areas of the liver tissue. METHODS: We analyzed the composition of T cells, B cells, PCs, and macrophages in the liver biopsies of 12 patients with dnIH, 9 of them obtained at the time of diagnosis. For comparison, biopsies from 9 patients with chronic rejection (CR) were included in the study. The results were analyzed by a computer-assisted stereology quantification method. RESULTS: The major components of the infiltrates in the portal areas were CD3(+) T lymphocytes in both groups, with 36.6% in the dnIH group versus 49.4% in the CR group. CD20(+) B lymphocytes represented 14.9% in the dnIH group and 29.1% in the CR group. Macrophage levels were very similar in the dnIH and CR group (19.7% versus 16.8%, respectively). PCs were much less represented in CR biopsies than those from the dnIH group (mean value of 4.7% versus 28.8%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the determination of a characteristic cellular profile could be an important tool for a more reliable diagnosis of dnIH, in support of the histological evaluation made by the pathologist, which in most cases is challenging. Recognition of this condition is crucial because it leads to graft failure if left untreated."

Microscopy with ultraviolet surface excitation (MUSE) is a low-cost optical sectioning technique using ultraviolet illumination which limits fluorescence excitation to the specimen surface. In this paper, we characterize MUSE using high incident angle, water immersion illumination to improve sectioning. Propidium iodide is used as a nuclear stain and eosin yellow as a counterstain. Histologic features of specimens using MUSE, nonlinear microscopy (NLM) and conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology were evaluated by pathologists to assess potential application in Mohs surgery for skin cancer and lumpectomy for breast cancer. MUSE images of basal cell carcinoma showed high correspondence with frozen section H&E histology, suggesting that MUSE may be applicable to Mohs surgery. However, correspondence in breast tissue between MUSE and paraffin embedded H&E histology was limited due to the thicker optical sectioning in MUSE, suggesting that further development is needed for breast surgical applications. We further demonstrate that the transverse image resolution of MUSE is limited by the optical sectioning thickness and use co-registered NLM to quantify the improvement in MUSE optical sectioning from high incident angle water immersion illumination."

However, traditional qualitative and/or semi-quantitative parameters obtained by pathologist's visual examination have very limited capability to capture this interaction between tumor and its microenvironment. With the advent of digital pathology, computerized image analysis may provide a better tumor characterization and give new insights into this problem. RESULTS: We propose a novel bioimage informatics pipeline for automatically characterizing the topological organization of different cell patterns in the tumor microenvironment. We apply this pipeline to the only publicly available large histopathology image dataset for a cohort of 190 patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. Experimental results show that the proposed topological features can successfully stratify early- and middle-stage patients with distinct survival, and show superior performance to traditional clinical features and cellular morphological and intensity features. The proposed features not only provide new insights into the topological organizations of cancers, but also can be integrated with genomic data in future studies to develop new integrative biomarkers.

Hence, preoperative differentiation is vital. PURPOSE: To investigate whether intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can differentiate NMIBC from MIBC and to assess whether there were correlations between IVIM parameters and the Ki-67 labeling index (LI). STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: Thirty-six patients diagnosed with bladder cancer confirmed by histopathological findings. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) DWI with eight b-values ranging from 0 to 1000 s/mm(2) . ASSESSMENT: Molecular diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (f), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated by biexponential and monoexponential models fits, respectively. STATISTICAL TESTS: Comparisons were made between the MIBC and NMIBC group, and differences were analyzed by comparing the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs). The correlations between these parameters and Ki-67 LI were assessed by Spearman's rank correlation analysis. RESULTS: The ADC and D value were significantly lower in patients with MIBC compared to those with NMIBC (P < 0.01). No significant (P > 0.05) differences were observed in D* and f. The AUC of D value (0.894) was significantly (P < 0.05) larger than the ADC value (0.786), with sensitivities and specificities of 95% and 87.5% (D) and 80% and 68.7% (ADC), respectively. In addition, the D and ADC values were significantly correlated with Ki-67 LI (r = -0.785, r = -0.643, respectively; both P < 0.01).

The reported data analyzed diffusion-weighted imaging findings. The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between histopathological findings, such as tumor cellularity, nucleic areas and proliferation index Ki-67, and signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images in PCNSL. PROCEDURES: For this study, 18 patients with PCNSL were retrospectively investigated by histogram analysis on precontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. For every patient, histopathology parameters, nucleic count, total nucleic area, and average nucleic area, as well as Ki-67 index, were estimated. RESULTS: Correlation analysis identified several statistically significant associations. Skewness derived from precontrast T1-weighted images correlated with Ki-67 index (p = - 0.55, P = 0.028). Furthermore, entropy derived from precontrast T1-weighted images correlated with average nucleic area (p = 0.53, P = 0.04). Several parameters from postcontrast T1-weighted images correlated with nucleic count: maximum signal intensity (p = 0.59, P = 0.017), P75 (p = 0.56, P = 0.02), and P90 (p = 0.52, P = 0.04) as well as SD (p = 0.58, P = 0.02). Maximum signal intensity derived from FLAIR sequence correlated with nucleic count (p = 0.50, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Histogram-derived parameters of conventional MRI sequences can reflect different histopathological features in PSNCL."

Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2 has been addressed, but few studies have reported the value of PI-RADS v2 for assessing risk stratification in patients with PCa, especially on selecting potential candidates for AS. PURPOSE: To investigate the utility of PI-RADS v2 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in evaluating patients with insignificant PCa, who are suitable for AS. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: In all, 238 patients with PCa who met the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance criteria underwent radical prostatectomy. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T, including T(2) -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. ASSESSMENT: Insignificant cancer was defined histopathologically as an organ-confined disease with a tumor volume <0.5 cm(3) without Gleason score 4-5. Patients were divided into two groups based on the PI-RADS v2 and tumor ADC: A, PI-RADS score </=3 and ADC >/=1.095 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s; and B, PI-RADS score 4-5 or ADC <1.095 x 10(-3) mm(2) /s. Preoperative clinical and imaging variables were evaluated regarding the associations with insignificant cancer. RESULTS: Of the 238 patients, 101 (42.8%) were diagnosed with insignificant cancer on pathological findings. The number of positive cores, prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), PI-RADS v2 and tumor ADC were significantly associated with insignificant cancer on univariate analysis (P < 0.05). However, multivariate analysis indicated tumor ADC (odds ratio [OR] = 4.57, P < 0.001) and PI-RADS v2 (OR = 3.60, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of insignificant cancer.

Epub 2017 Sep 21.,Kolarević D,J Microsc,2018,2017/09/24,,,10.1111/jmi.12645,"The purpose of this study was to improve the prognostic value of tumour histopathology image analysis methodology by image preprocessing. Key image qualities were modified including contrast, sharpness and brightness. The texture information was subsequently extracted from images of haematoxylin/eosin-stained tumour tissue sections by GLCM, monofractal and multifractal algorithms without any analytical limitation to predefined structures. Images were derived from patient groups with invasive breast carcinoma (BC, 93 patients) and inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC, 51 patients). The prognostic performance was indeed significantly enhanced by preprocessing with the average AUCs of individual texture features improving from 0.68 +/- 0.05 for original to 0.78 +/- 0.01 for preprocessed images in the BC group and 0.75 +/- 0.01 to 0.80 +/- 0.02 in the IBC group. Image preprocessing also improved the prognostic independence of texture features as indicated by multivariate analysis. Surprisingly, the tonal histogram compression by the nonnormalisation preprocessing has prognostically outperformed the tested contrast normalisation algorithms. Generally, features without prognostic value showed higher susceptibility to prognostic enhancement by preprocessing whereas IDM texture feature was exceptionally susceptible. The obtained results are suggestive of the existence of distinct texture prognostic clues in the two examined types of breast cancer. The obtained enhancement of prognostic performance is essential for the anticipated clinical use of this method as a simple and cost-effective prognosticator of cancer outcome."

In this study, dynamic fluorescence imaging was used to harness differences in the perfusion kinetics of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes to visualize structural characteristics of different tissues. Using the hydrophobic nontumor-selective NIR dye cypate, and the hydrophilic dye LS288, a high tumor-to-background contrast was achieved, allowing the delineation of diverse tissue types while maintaining short imaging times. By clustering tissue types with similar perfusion properties, the dynamic fluorescence imaging method identified secondary tumor locations when only the primary tumor position was known, with a respective sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.75 for cypate, and 0.85 and 0.81 for LS288. Histological analysis suggests that the vasculature in the connective tissue that directly surrounds the tumor was a major factor for tumor identification through perfusion imaging. Although the hydrophobic dye showed higher specificity than the hydrophilic probe, use of other dyes with different physical and biological properties could further improve the accuracy of the dynamic imaging platform to identify multifocal tumors for potential use in real-time intraoperative procedures."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six BALB/c-nu nude mice were divided into two groups that were injected with two different nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (CNE1 and CNE2). DK magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed on a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner. DWI and DKI-related parameters, including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), mean diffusivity (MD) and mean kurtosis (MK) were measured. Mice were euthanatized when the maximum diameter of the primary tumor reached 1.5cm after MR scanning. Tumor tissues were then processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining. The pathological images were analyzed using a computer-aided pixel-wise clustering method to evaluate tumor cellular density, nuclei portion, cytoplasm portion, extracellular space portion, the ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm and the ratio of nuclei to extracellular space. The relationships between DWI and DKI-related parameters and pathological features were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The ADC and MD values of the CNE1 group (1.16+/-0.24x10(-3)mm(2)/s, 2.28+/-0.29x10(-3)mm(2)/s) was higher than that of the CNE2 group (0.82+/-0.14x10(-3)mm(2)/s, 1.53+/-0.24x10(-3)mm(2)/s, P<0.001), but the MK values between the two groups were not significantly different (CNE1: 0.55+/-0.14; CNE2: 0.47+/-0.23; P>0.05). A Pearson test showed that the ADC and MD values were significantly correlated with cellular density, nuclei portion, extracellular space portion and the ratio of nuclei to extracellular space (r=-0.861; -0.909, P<0.001; r=-0.487; 0.591, P<0.05; r=0.567; 0.625, P<0.05; r=-0.645; -0.745, P<0.001, respectively). The MK values were significantly correlated with nuclei portion, cytoplasm portion and the ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm (r=-0.475, P<0.05; r=0.665, P<0.001; r=-0.494, P<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: The preliminary animal results suggest that DKI findings can provide valuable bio-information for NPC tissue characterization. DKI imaging might be utilized as a surrogate biomarker for the non-invasive assessment of tumor microstructures."

However, accurate, automated, and easy-to-use cell segmentation remains a challenge, especially in cases of high cell densities, where discrete boundaries are not easily discernable. Here, we present a fully automated segmentation algorithm that iteratively segments cells based on the observed distribution of optical cell volumes measured by quantitative phase microscopy. By fitting these distributions to known probability density functions, we are able to converge on volumetric thresholds that enable valid segmentation cuts. Since each threshold is determined from the observed data itself, virtually no input is needed from the user. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach over time using six cell types that display a range of morphologies, and evaluate these cultures over a range of confluencies. Facile dynamic measures of cell mobility and function revealed unique cellular behaviors that relate to tissue origins, state of differentiation, and real-time signaling. These will improve our understanding of multicellular communication and organization."

Sixteen fresh frozen cadaveric knees (mean age: 52.0 +/- 6.2 years) were used for this study. The specimens were bisected in the coronal plane, in accordance with the fiber orientation of the ACL tibial attachment. Adjacent sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to observe the morphology of the ACL insertion and with fast green and Safranin-O protocols to evaluate for collagen and proteoglycans (PG). The insertion area on the tibial footprint was divided into five zones in the medial to lateral direction, which was determined by division of the section from most prominent medial tibial spine to most lateral margin of ACL attachment. Then rectangular area with a vertical length that is twice the width of respective five zones was set. Stained areas of all images were quantified positively by using ImageJ software, and the value for staining area measured was defined in percentage by multiplying whole image area by 100. The mean proportion of Safranin-O staining is significantly greater nearer to the medial tibial spine (59% in zone 1, 32% in zone 2, 13% in zone 3, 13% in zone 4, and 4% in zone 5, P < 0.001). The medial section of the tibial insertion area grew in size and increased in PG staining with more densely organized collagen arrangement with more fibrocartilage cells. The ACL tibial insertion showed a medially eccentric staining pattern by histological evaluation of the ACL attachment to cartilage. Our histological results of the eccentric biomaterial property in the medial tibial spine of ACL insertion area can be considered in making a more functional anatomic tibial tunnel placement."

When these particles slide on enamel, a combined process of microcutting and microcracking in the surface and subsurface of the enamel takes place. The aim of this study was to detect microscopic differences in the microcrack behavior by subjecting enamel specimens derived from different age groups (immature open-apex premolars, mature closed-apex premolars, and deciduous molars) to cycles of simulated impact and sliding wear testing under controlled conditions. Our findings indicated that the characteristics of the microcracks, including the length, depth, count, orientation, and relation to microstructures differed among the study groups. The differences between the surface and subsurface microcrack characteristics were most notable in the enamel of deciduous molars followed by immature premolars and mature premolars whereby deciduous enamel suffered numerous, extensive, and branched microcracks. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that enamel surface and subsurface microcracks characteristics are dependent on the posteruptive age with deciduous enamel being the least resistant to wear based on the microcrack behavior as compared to permanent enamel."

It consists of a collection of several (up to 1000 or more) tissue samples that are assembled onto a single support - typically a glass slide - according to a design grid (array) layout, in order to allow multiplex analysis by treating numerous samples under identical and standardized conditions. However, during the TMA manufacturing process, the sample positions can be highly distorted from the design grid due to the imprecision when assembling tissue samples and the deformation of the embedding waxes. Consequently, these distortions may lead to severe errors of (histological) assay results when the sample identities are mismatched between the design and its manufactured output. The development of a robust method for de-arraying TMA, which localizes and matches TMA samples with their design grid, is therefore crucial to overcome the bottleneck of this prominent technology. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose an Automatic, fast and robust TMA De-arraying (ATMAD) approach dedicated to images acquired with brightfield and fluorescence microscopes (or scanners). First, tissue samples are localized in the large image by applying a locally adaptive thresholding on the isotropic wavelet transform of the input TMA image. To reduce false detections, a parametric shape model is considered for segmenting ellipse-shaped objects at each detected position. Segmented objects that do not meet the size and the roundness criteria are discarded from the list of tissue samples before being matched with the design grid. Sample matching is performed by estimating the TMA grid deformation under the thin-plate model. Finally, thanks to the estimated deformation, the true tissue samples that were preliminary rejected in the early image processing step are recognized by running a second segmentation step. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel de-arraying approach for TMA analysis. By combining wavelet-based detection, active contour segmentation, and thin-plate spline interpolation, our approach is able to handle TMA images with high dynamic, poor signal-to-noise ratio, complex background and non-linear deformation of TMA grid. In addition, the deformation estimation produces quantitative information to asset the manufacturing quality of TMAs."

Here we correlated prognostic clinical and biological features of neuroblastic tumors with the density of extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans (the main components of the extracellular matrix 'ground substance'), in nearly 400 primary samples. We also studied the relationship between the density of extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans and the expression of B3GALT6, an enzyme required for their synthesis. We associated a decrease in glycosaminoglycans with neuroblastomas that were histopathologically poorly-differentiated or undifferentiated, as well as with metastatic disease, and 1p36 deleted tumors. This decrease in glycosaminoglycans was also related to abnormal nuclear B3GALT6 expression in neuroblastic cells. These findings point towards the importance of the ground substance in the aggressiveness of neuroblastic tumors, which should therefore be considered when developing novel therapies for treating neuroblastomas."

Although the immunogenic potential of particulate contaminants likely depends on particle structural characteristics (e.g., composition, size, and shape), exact structure-immunogenicity relationships are unknown. Images recorded by flow imaging microscopy reflect information about particle morphology, but flow microscopy is typically used to determine only particle size distributions, neglecting information on particle morphological features that may be immunologically relevant. We recently developed computational techniques that utilize the Kullback-Leibler divergence and multidimensional scaling to compare the morphological properties of particles in sets of flow microscopy images. In the current work, we combined these techniques with expectation maximization cluster analyses and used them to compare flow imaging microscopy data sets that had been collected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after severe adverse drug reactions (including 7 fatalities) were observed in patients who had been administered some lots of peginesatide formulations.

Epub 2018 Mar 16.,Ahlawat S,Eur J Radiol,2018,2018/04/25,,,10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.03.018,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of ""target sign"" on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping for peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) characterization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study retrospectively reviewed the MR imaging (comprised of T2- FS, DWI (b-values 50, 400, 800 s/mm(2)and ADC mapping), and static contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-W imaging) of 42 patients (mean age: 40 years (range 8-68 years), 48% (20/42) females) with 15 malignant PNSTs (MPNSTs) and 33 benign PNSTs (BPNSTs). MPNSTs were histologically confirmed while BPNSTs were histologically-proven or with stable clinical and imaging appearance for at least 12 months. Two radiologists assessed imaging characteristics (size, signal intensity, heterogeneity, perilesional edema or enhancement) and the presence or absence of ""target sign,"" on each sequence. A ""target sign"" was defined as a biphasic pattern of peripheral hyperintensity and homogeneous central hypointensity. Descriptive statistics are reported. Cohen's kappa statistic or interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to evaluate interobserver agreement between two observers. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to identify MRI features with predictive values. RESULTS: MPNSTs were larger than BPNSTs (6.3 +/- 2.5 cm vs 3.5 +/- -2.1 cm, p = 0.0002), had perilesional edema (87%(13/15) vs 18%(6/33), p < 0.0001), heterogeneous enhancement (71%(10/14) vs 13%(4/31), p = 0.0001) and perilesional enhancement (79%(11/14) vs 18%(6/31), p = 0.0001), respectively. The ""target sign"" was present in: 24%(8/33) BPNSTs vs 0/15 MPNST on T2-FS (p = 0.26); 39%(13/33) BPNSTs vs 20%(3/15) MPNST on DWI using b-value = 50 s/mm(2) (p = 0.5); 55%(18/33) BPNSTs vs 6%(1/15) MPNST on DWI using b-value = 400 s/mm(2) (p = 0.002); 48%(16/33) BPNSTs vs 6%(1/15) MPNST on DWI using b-value = 800 s/mm(2) (p = 0.005) and 64%(21/33) benign vs 0/15 MPNST on ADC mapping(p < 0.0001). By CE-T1 imaging, 32%(10/31) BPNSTs and 7%(1/14) MPNST had a target sign(p = 0.07). The odds of an MPNST in cases with minimum ADC </= 1.0 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s are 150 times higher than in cases with ADC > 1.0 x 10(-3). CONCLUSION: In this explorative study, a ""target sign"" suggests a benign PNST and is more often visible on DWI using high b-values and ADC maps compared with anatomic sequences."

Epub 2017 Sep 30.,Gupta L,J Magn Reson Imaging,2018,2017/10/01,,,10.1002/jmri.25869,"BACKGROUND: Glioma grade along with patient's age and general health are used for treatment planning and prognosis. PURPOSE: To characterize and quantify the spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in gliomas using measures based on T2*-weighted signal time-series and to distinguish between high- and low-grade gliomas. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: Twenty-one patients with high-grade and 13 patients with low-grade gliomas confirmed on histology were investigated. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Dynamic T2*-weighted (multislice single-shot echo-planar-imaging) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 3T system with an 8-element receive-only head coil to measure the BOLD fluctuations. In addition, a dynamic T(1) -weighted (3D fast field echo) dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion scan was performed. ASSESSMENT: Three BOLD measures were determined: the temporal shift (TS), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo). DCE perfusion-based cerebral blood volume (CBV) and time-to-peak (TTP) maps were concurrently evaluated for comparison. STATISTICAL TESTS: An analysis-of-variance test was first used. When the test appeared significant, post-hoc analysis was performed using analysis-of-covariance with age as covariate. Logistic regression and receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis were also performed. RESULTS: TS was significantly advanced in high-grade gliomas compared to the contralateral cortex (P = 0.01) and low-grade gliomas (P = 0.009). In high-grade gliomas, ALFF and CBV were significantly higher than the contralateral cortex (P = 0.041 and P = 0.008, respectively) and low-grade gliomas (P = 0.036 and P = 0.01, respectively). ReHo and TTP did not show significant differences between high- and low-grade gliomas (P = 0.46 and P = 0.42, respectively). The area-under-curve was above 0.7 only for the TS, ALFF, and CBV measures. DATA CONCLUSION: Advanced and amplified hemodynamic fluctuations manifest in high-grade gliomas, but not in low-grade gliomas, and can be assessed using BOLD measures. Preliminary results showed that quantification of spontaneous fluctuations has potential for hemodynamic characterization of gliomas and distinguishing between high- and low-grade gliomas.

Epub 2018 Mar 12.,Byun J,World Neurosurg,2018,2018/03/17,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.03.007,"BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a very rare glial neoplasm. The clinical behavior of PXA is not uniform, and the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of adult PXA and identify prognostic factors. METHODS: Twenty-five patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with PXA between 2002 and 2016 were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (84%) had PXA World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and 4 patients (16%) had anaplastic PXA (WHO grade III). The median overall survival of PXA WHO grade II and III was 97 and 56 months, respectively. The 3-year progression-free survival of PXA WHO grade II and III was 65.1% and 50%, respectively (P = 0.37 and 0.21). Diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and positron emission tomography findings failed to predict the histologic grade of PXA and recurrence of PXA WHO grade II. Tumor size >40 mm and presence of evident peritumoral edema (ePTE) were prognostic factors for poor progression-free survival (hazard ratios, 4.4 and 15.2, respectively; P = 0.03 and 0.01) according to a univariate analysis. In the recurrent and silent PXA grade II groups, ePTE was present in 87.5% and 23.1% of cases, respectively (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and radiologic features of PXA are not uniform. Tumor size and ePTE are possible prognostic factors for adult PXA. Also, peritumoral edema may be associated with recurrence in PXA WHO grade II. PXA showed a high recurrence rate, and thus close follow-up is needed."

Epub 2018 Feb 23.,Ma Y,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2018,2018/04/14,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.02.020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Content-based image retrieval is an effective method for histopathological image analysis. However, given a database of huge whole slide images (WSIs), acquiring appropriate region-of-interests (ROIs) for training is significant and difficult. Moreover, histopathological images can only be annotated by pathologists, resulting in the lack of labeling information. Therefore, it is an important and challenging task to generate ROIs from WSI and retrieve image with few labels. METHODS: This paper presents a novel unsupervised region proposing method for histopathological WSI based on Selective Search. Specifically, the WSI is over-segmented into regions which are hierarchically merged until the WSI becomes a single region. Nucleus-oriented similarity measures for region mergence and Nucleus-Cytoplasm color space for histopathological image are specially defined to generate accurate region proposals. Additionally, we propose a new semi-supervised hashing method for image retrieval. The semantic features of images are extracted with Latent Dirichlet Allocation and transformed into binary hashing codes with Supervised Hashing. RESULTS: The methods are tested on a large-scale multi-class database of breast histopathological WSIs. The results demonstrate that for one WSI, our region proposing method can generate 7.3 thousand contoured regions which fit well with 95.8% of the ROIs annotated by pathologists. The proposed hashing method can retrieve a query image among 136 thousand images in 0.29 s and reach precision of 91% with only 10% of images labeled. CONCLUSIONS: The unsupervised region proposing method can generate regions as predictions of lesions in histopathological WSI. The region proposals can also serve as the training samples to train machine-learning models for image retrieval. The proposed hashing method can achieve fast and precise image retrieval with small amount of labels. Furthermore, the proposed methods can be potentially applied in online computer-aided-diagnosis systems."

Epub 2018 Apr 25.,Androuin A,Acta Neuropathol,2018,2018/04/27,,,10.1007/s00401-018-1847-6,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a progressive loss of synapses and neurons. Studies in animal models indicate that morphological alterations of dendritic spines precede synapse loss, increasing the proportion of large and short (""stubby"") spines. Whether similar alterations occur in human patients, and what their functional consequences could be, is not known. We analyzed biopsies from AD patients and APP x presenilin 1 knock-in mice that were previously shown to present a loss of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. We observed that the proportion of stubby spines and the width of spine necks are inversely correlated with synapse density in frontal cortical biopsies from non-AD and AD patients. In mice, the reduction in the density of synapses in the stratum radiatum was preceded by an alteration of spine morphology, with a reduction of their length and an enlargement of their neck. Serial sectioning examined with electron microscopy allowed us to precisely measure spine parameters. Mathematical modeling indicated that the shortening and widening of the necks should alter the electrical compartmentalization of the spines, leading to reduced postsynaptic potentials in spine heads, but not in soma. Accordingly, there was no alteration in basal synaptic transmission, but long-term potentiation and spatial memory were impaired. These results indicate that an alteration of spine morphology could be involved in the early cognitive deficits associated with AD."

However, when coupled to live-cell imaging, such strategies are difficult to implement with precision and high time resolution, and the simultaneous alteration of multiple parameters is a major challenge. Recently, microfluidics has provided powerful solutions for such analyses, bringing an unprecedented level of control over the conditions and the medium in which cells under microscopic observation are grown. However, such technologies have remained under-exploited, largely as a result of the complexity associated with microfabrication procedures. RESULTS: In this study, we have developed simple but powerful microfluidic devices dedicated to live-cell imaging. These microsystems take advantage of a robust elastomer that is readily available to researchers and that presents excellent bonding properties, in particular to microscopy-grade glass coverslips. Importantly, the chips are easy-to-build without sophisticated equipment, and they are compatible with the integration of complex, customized fluidic networks as well as with the multiplexing of independent assays on a single device. We show that the chips are re-usable, a significant advantage for the popularization of microfluidics in cell biology. Moreover, we demonstrate that they allow for the dynamic, accurate and simultaneous control of multiple parameters of the cellular environment. CONCLUSIONS: While they do not possess all the features of the microdevices that are built using complex and costly procedures, the simplicity and versatility of the chips that we have developed make them an attractive alternative for a range of applications. The emergence of such devices, which can be fabricated and used by any laboratory, will provide the possibility for a larger number of research teams to take full advantage of these new methods for investigating cell biology."

While manual annotations are time-consuming and operator-dependent, full automated segmentation remains a challenging task due to the high variability of cells intensity, size and morphology. Most of the proposed algorithms for the automated segmentation of nuclei were designed for specific organ or tissues. RESULTS: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a fully multiscale method, named MANA (Multiscale Adaptive Nuclei Analysis), for nuclei segmentation in different tissues and magnifications. MANA was tested on a dataset of H&E stained tissue images with more than 59,000 annotated nuclei, taken from six organs (colon, liver, bone, prostate, adrenal gland and thyroid) and three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). Automatic results were compared with manual segmentations and three open-source software designed for nuclei detection. For each organ, MANA obtained always an F1-score higher than 0.91, with an average F1 of 0.9305 +/- 0.0161. The average computational time was about 20 s independently of the number of nuclei to be detected (anyway, higher than 1000), indicating the efficiency of the proposed technique. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, MANA is the first fully automated multi-scale and multi-tissue algorithm for nuclei detection. Overall, the robustness and versatility of MANA allowed to achieve, on different organs and magnifications, performances in line or better than those of state-of-art algorithms optimized for single tissues."

Epub 2018 Feb 1.,Sato T,J Hand Surg Am,2018,2018/02/04,,,10.1016/j.jhsa.2017.12.009,"PURPOSE: To identify the layered relationship anatomically between the musculotendinous structures of the adductor pollicis, the ulnar collateral ligament, and the capsule of the metacarpophalangeal joint in terms of understanding the pathomechanism of a Stener lesion. METHODS: We macroscopically analyzed 37 cadaveric thumbs to identify the intramuscular tendon of the adductor pollicis and bony attachments of the joint capsule including the ulnar collateral ligament. In addition, we histologically analyzed 3 thumbs and made a 3-dimensional image of 3 other thumbs, using micro-computed tomography. RESULTS: The adductor pollicis has 3 components of an intramuscular tendon (dorsal, palmar, and distal), which connect to form a lambda shape. The dorsal part inserts into the joint capsule dorsal to the ulnar sesamoid. The palmar part inserts into the ulnar sesamoid. The distal part inserts into the lateral tubercle of the proximal phalanx. The thickened and cord-like part of the joint capsule, which has generally been referred to as the proper ulnar collateral ligament, has a distinct bony attachment on the proximal slope of the lateral tubercle of the proximal phalanx separate from the adductor pollicis insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 3 components of the intramuscular tendon of the adductor pollicis muscle, the dorsal part inserted into not only the aponeurosis but also the joint capsule. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of the current study suggest the anatomic basis for a possible pathomechanism of the Stener lesion."

Based on emerging evidence of enhanced detection, the program transitioned to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening. METHODS: This is a prospective pilot evaluation of DBT with synthesised 2D mammography screening implemented during April 2015-March 2017; the rate and characteristics of cancers detected at DBT screening were compared with those detected at the preceding digital mammography (DM) screening round (April 2013-March 2015) in the same screening program. Distribution of imaging and tumour characteristics were compared. RESULTS: Amongst 34,071 women screened in the Verona DBT pilot, 315 BCs were detected; 153 BCs were detected amongst 29,360 women in the DM screening round. Estimated CDRs were 9.2/1000 (95% CI 8.3-10.3) DBT screens versus 5.2/1000 (95% CI 4.4-6.1) DM screens, P < 0.001. Statistically significant differences were found in the distribution of whether recall by one/both screen readers (more BCs recalled by both readers at DBT than DM); whether detected on one/two views (higher proportion detected on only one view at DBT than DM); type of radiological lesions; tumour stage, pT and histological categories (lower proportion of DCIS/pTis, higher proportions of pT1a and pT1b, and higher proportion of invasive cancers of special types, at DBT than DM); and tumour grade (higher proportion of grade I at DBT than DM). There were no differences in distributions of nodal and hormone receptor (ER/PR) status. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide early insights into the extent that transitioning to DBT screening may modify the characteristics of screen-detected breast cancer to inform discussion regarding pros and cons of DBT screening; although our data provide some reassurance that DBT does not increase the proportion of screen-detected DCIS, they highlight mixed findings on comparative tumour characteristics, suggesting a potential for enhancing screening benefit and possibly also over-diagnosis from DBT screening."

METHODS: Thirteen adult anticorrosive cadaveric specimens (8 males, 5 females) were dissected in this study. 3 fresh cases (2 males, 1 female) were used to observe the zonal pattern of arteries supplying brachial plexus, and 10 cases (6 males, 4 females) were used to observe the source and distribution of the brachial plexus arteries under microscope. RESULTS: The brachial plexus is supplied by branches of the subclavian-axillary axis (SAA), and these branches anastomose each other. According to distribution feature, blood supply of the brachial plexus could be divided into three zones. The first zone was from the nerve roots of intervertebral foramina to its proximal trunks, which was supplied by the vertebral artery and the deep cervical artery. The second zone was from the distal nerve trunks of the brachial plexus, encompassing the divisions to its proximal cords, which was supplied by direct branches of the subclavian artery or by branches originating from the dorsal scapular artery. The third zone was from the distal portion of the cords to terminal branches of the brachial plexus, which was supplied by direct branches of the axillary artery. CONCLUSIONS: The zonal pattern of arterial supply to the brachial plexus is a systematic and comprehensive modality to improve anatomical basis for the clinical microsurgical treatment for brachial plexus injury."

The development of high-throughput microscopy and image analysis has enabled scratch assays to become compatible with high-throughput research. However, effective processing and in-depth analysis of such high-throughput image datasets are far from trivial and require integration of multiple image processing and data extraction software tools. FINDINGS: We developed and implemented a kinetic re-epithelialization analysis pipeline (KREAP) in Galaxy. The KREAP toolbox incorporates freely available image analysis tools and automatically performs image segmentation and feature extraction of each image series, followed by automatic quantification of cells inside and outside the scratched area over time. The enumeration of infiltrating cells over time is modeled to extract three biologically relevant parameters that describe re-epithelialization kinetics. The output of the tools is organized, displayed, and saved in the Galaxy environment for future reference. CONCLUSIONS: The KREAP toolbox in Galaxy provides an open-source, easy-to-use, web-based platform for reproducible image processing and data analysis of high-throughput scratch assays. The KREAP toolbox could assist a broad scientific community in the discovery of compounds that are able to modulate re-epithelialization kinetics."

To ensure the quality of downstream biomedical analyses, it is essential to accurately segment clustered nuclei. However, this presents a technical challenge as fluorescence intensity alone is often insufficient for recovering the true nuclei boundaries. In this paper, we propose an segmentation algorithm that identifies point pair connection candidates and evaluates adjacent point connections with a formulated ellipse fitting quality indicator. After connection relationships are determined, we recover the resulting dividing paths by following points with specific eigenvalues from the image Hessian in a constrained searching space. We validate our algorithm with 560 image patches from two classes of tumor regions of seven brain tumor patients. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results suggest that our algorithm is promising for dividing overlapped nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images widely used in various biomedical research."

Modern automated microscopes produce vast amounts of images routinely, making manual analysis nearly impossible. Due to their efficiency, machine learning-based analysis software have become essential tools to perform single-cell-level phenotypic analysis of large imaging datasets. However, an important limitation of such methods is that they do not use the information gained from the cellular micro- and macroenvironment: the algorithmic decision is based solely on the local properties of the cell of interest. Here, we present how various features from the surrounding environment contribute to identifying a cell and how such additional information can improve single-cell-level phenotypic image analysis. The proposed methodology was tested for different sizes of Euclidean and nearest neighbour-based cellular environments both on tissue sections and cell cultures. Our experimental data verify that the surrounding area of a cell largely determines its entity. This effect was found to be especially strong for established tissues, while it was somewhat weaker in the case of cell cultures. Our analysis shows that combining local cellular features with the properties of the cell's neighbourhood significantly improves the accuracy of machine learning-based phenotyping."

The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in nuclear properties of the H&E-stained biopsy material between low CIN and high CIN cases and associate those properties with the CIN grade. METHODS: The clinical material comprised hematoxylin and eosin- (H&E-) stained biopsy specimens from lesions of 44 patients diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Four or five nonoverlapping microscopy images were digitized from each patient's H&E specimens, from regions indicated by the expert physician. Sixty-three textural and morphological nuclear features were generated for each patient's images. The Wilcoxon statistical test and the point biserial correlation were used to estimate each feature's discriminatory power between low CIN and high CIN cases and its correlation with the advancing CIN grade, respectively. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed 19 features that quantify nuclear shape, size, and texture and sustain statistically significant differences between low CIN and high CIN cases. These findings revealed that nuclei in high CIN cases, as compared to nuclei in low CIN cases, have more irregular shape, are larger in size, are coarser in texture, contain higher edges, have higher local contrast, are more inhomogeneous, and comprise structures of different intensities. CONCLUSION: A systematic statistical analysis of nucleus features, quantified from the H&E-stained biopsy material, showed that there are significant differences in the shape, size, and texture of nuclei between low CIN and high CIN cases."

However, quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy images faces crucial challenges such as morphologic variability within cells. In this work, we developed an analytical strategy to deal with cell shape and size variability that is based on an elastic geometric alignment algorithm. Firstly, synthetic images mimicking cell populations with morphological variability were used to test and optimize the algorithm, under controlled conditions. We have computed expression profiles specifically assessing cell-cell interactions (IN profiles) and profiles focusing on the distribution of a marker throughout the intracellular space of single cells (RD profiles). To experimentally validate our analytical pipeline, we have used real images of cell cultures stained for E-cadherin, tubulin and a mitochondria dye, selected as prototypes of membrane, cytoplasmic and organelle-specific markers. The results demonstrated that our algorithm is able to generate a detailed quantitative report and a faithful representation of a large panel of molecules, distributed in distinct cellular compartments, independently of cell's morphological features. This is a simple end-user method that can be widely explored in research and diagnostic labs to unravel protein regulation mechanisms or identify protein expression patterns associated with disease."

However, manual detection and characterization of tumor regions in pathology images is labor intensive and subjective. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we developed an automated tumor region recognition system for lung cancer pathology images. From the identified tumor regions, we extracted 22 well-defined shape and boundary features and found that 15 of them were significantly associated with patient survival outcome in lung adenocarcinoma patients from the National Lung Screening Trial. A tumor region shape-based prognostic model was developed and validated in an independent patient cohort (n = 389). The predicted high-risk group had significantly worse survival than the low-risk group (p value = 0.0029). Predicted risk group serves as an independent prognostic factor (high-risk vs. low-risk, hazard ratio = 2.25, 95% CI 1.34-3.77, p value = 0.0022) after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and stage. This study provides new insights into the relationship between tumor shape and patient prognosis."

Epub 2018 Feb 2.,Dugaret AS,Skin Res Technol,2018,2018/02/04,,,10.1111/srt.12445,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Following intradermal injection, hyaluronic acid (HA)-based fillers tend to spread within the reticular dermis and to distribute between the dermal fibers. This biointegration is commonly measured qualitatively using histological methods. We developed a ""toolbox"" consisting of a visual scoring and a semi-automatic image analysis method using internal developed algorithm to quantitate the biointegration of Restylane(R) in histological sections. METHODS: Restylane((R)) was injected intradermally in the abdominal skin of 10 healthy human subjects scheduled for abdominoplasty. The injections were performed either in vivo before surgery or ex vivo on samples taken post-surgery at different time points. The samples were processed for histology by visual scoring and image analysis using algorithms developed in Definiens to assess biointegration. RESULTS: The image analysis segmentation was accurate with <5% manual changes. Furthermore, the results calculated with the semi-automatic method were consistent with the visual scores obtained on injected human skin samples by means of a 5-grade photographic scale. A modified hematoxylin-eosin staining was found adequate to visualize both, the filler and the general morphology, on the same section. An excellent correlation was observed between the integration results obtained with PAS/Alcian Blue and HE-stained slides, allowing for a single staining in future studies. CONCLUSION: We developed a modified HE staining histological method and a new histomorphometric image analysis tool to quantitate biointegration of HA-based fillers in human skin. The results obtained in this study confirmed the known intermediate biointegration properties of Restylane(R), thus validating these innovative methods."

Because of limited data on normal breast tissue from healthy women, we examined associations of reproductive history and established breast cancer risk factors with breast tissue composition and markers of hormone receptors and proliferation in a nested study within the Karolinska Mammography project for risk prediction for breast cancer (Karma). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissues from 153 women were obtained by ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy as part of the Karma project. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assessed histological composition of epithelial, stromal and adipose tissue, epithelial and stromal oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, and Ki-67 proliferation status. An individualised reproductive score including parity, number of pregnancies without birth, number of births, age at first birth, and duration of breastfeeding, was calculated based on self-reported reproductive history at the time of the Karma study entry. All analyses were adjusted for age and BMI. RESULTS: Cumulated reproductive score was associated with increased total epithelial content and greater expression of epithelial ER. Parity was associated with greater epithelial area, increased epithelial-stromal ratio, greater epithelial ER expression and a lower extent of stromal proliferation. Increasing numbers of pregnancies and births were associated with a greater epithelial area in the entire study set, which remained significant among postmenopausal women. Increasing numbers of pregnancies and births were also associated with a greater expression of epithelial ER among postmenopausal women. Longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with greater epithelial area and greater expression of epithelial PR both in the entire study set and among postmenopausal women. Breastfeeding was also positively associated with greater epithelial ER expression among postmenopausal women. Prior use of oral contraceptives was associated with lower epithelial-stromal ratio amongst all participants and among pre- and postmenopausal women separately. CONCLUSION: Reproductive risk factors significantly influence the epithelial tissue compartment and expression of hormone receptors in later life. These changes remain after menopause. This study provides deeper insights of the biological mechanisms by which reproductive history influences epithelial area and expression of hormone receptors, and as a consequence the risk of breast cancer."

To diagnose congenital diseases in the early stages of pregnancy, and to interpret the results of increasingly advanced in utero imaging techniques, a profound knowledge of normal human morphological development of the locomotor system and the nervous system is necessary. Muscular development, however, is an often neglected topic or is only described in a general way in embryology textbooks and papers. To provide the required detailed and updated comprehensive picture of embryologic muscular anatomy, three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were created based on serial histological sections of a human embryo at Carnegie stage 23 (8 weeks of development, crown-rump length of 23.8 mm), using Amira reconstruction software. Reconstructed muscles, tendons, bones and nerves were exported in a 3D-PDF file to permit interactive viewing. Almost all adult skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs could be individually identified in their relative adult position. The pectoralis major muscle was divided in three separate muscle heads. The reconstructions showed remarkable highly developed extraocular, infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscles at this age but surprisingly also absence of the facial muscles that have been described to be present at this stage of development. The overall stage of muscle development suggests heterochrony of skeletal muscle development. Several individual muscle groups were found to be developed earlier and in more detail than described in current literature."

METHODS: A library of background and nuclei regions was generated using pre-segmented Haematoxylin and Eosin images of brain tumours. Background image samples were used as input to an image quilting algorithm that produced the synthetic background image. Randomly selected pre-segmented nuclei were randomly fused on the synthetic background using a wavelet-based fusion approach. To investigate whether the produced synthetic images are meaningful and similar to real world images, two different tests were performed, one qualitative by an experienced histopathologist and one quantitative using the normalized mutual information and the Kullback-Leibler tests. To illustrate the challenges that synthetic images may pose to object recognition algorithms, two segmentation methodologies were utilized for nuclei detection, one based on the Otsu thresholding and another based on the seeded region growing approach. RESULTS: Results showed a satisfactory to good resemblance of the synthetic with the real world images according to both qualitative and quantitative tests. The segmentation accuracy was slightly higher for the seeded region growing algorithm (87.2%) than the Otsu's algorithm (86.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Since we know the exact coordinates of the regions of interest within the synthesised images, these images could then serve as a 'gold standard' for evaluation of segmentation algorithms in computer-aided diagnosis in tissue microscopy."

Epub 2018 Jun 22.,Chen X,Eur J Radiol,2018,2018/07/19,,,10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.06.019,"PURPOSE: Surgical resection is the most effective treatment for focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). However, many patients with FCD have unremarkable or even negative findings on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we explored the brain volume abnormalities of FCD patients at the individual level using an experimental volume-based morphometry algorithm and further estimated whether the volume abnormalities can help in the detection of FCD lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with histologically-proven FCD lesions were retrospectively studied. Among them, eight patients had no visible abnormalities on routine MRI, three had abnormalities which partly matched the location of the surgical resection regions, and two did not match. For each patient, cerebral high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) images were segmented into 45 structures, according to a brain anatomy template, and the volume of each structure was compared with an age- and gender-matched normal population at the individual level, based on a MorphoBox prototype. A Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of the prototype in patients. To find the most appropriate threshold value for localizing the epileptogenic zones, deviations from the normative ranges of each resulting volume estimate were assessed by z-scores. RESULTS: Volume abnormalities including atrophic and hypertrophic volumes could be found in all the patients. Epileptogenic zones were found in brain structures with an abnormal volume in 87.5% (14/16) of patients. In 71.4% of patients (10/14), these zones were fully located in regions with an atrophic volume. This suggests that FCD lesions are more likely to be in regions with an atrophic volume than in those with a hypertrophic volume. When the best cut-off z-score value was -3.0, the sensitivity, specificity, and ROC area under the curve of the volume estimates were 93.9%, 79.6%, and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSION: Volume abnormalities can assist in the diagnosis of epileptogenic zones at the individual level in FCD patients with negative or positive findings on conventional MR images. Atrophic regions are more likely than hypertrophic ones to represent epileptogenic zones. Volume-based morphometry based on a MorphoBox prototype has potential to assist a careful scrutiny by radiologists with target in atrophic regions in patients who are initially deemed to be MR-negative, further trying to increase the detection rate of FCD."

The architectural variations of epithelial layers and the presence of keratin pearls, which can be observed in microscopic images, are the key visual features in oral cancer diagnosis. The computer aided tool doing the same identification task would certainly provide crucial aid to clinicians for evaluation of histological images during diagnosis. In this paper, a two-stage approach is proposed for computing oral histology images, where 12-layered (7 x 7x3 channel patches) deep convolution neural network (CNN) are used for segmentation of constituent layers in the first stage and in the second stage the keratin pearls are detected from the segmented keratin regions using texture-based feature (Gabor filter) trained random forests. The performance of the proposed computing algorithm is tested in our developed oral cancer microscopic image database. The proposed texture-based random forest classifier has achieved 96.88% detection accuracy for detection of keratin pearls."

However, label-free imaging of live cells in 3D conditions is optically more challenging than in 2D. Quantitative phase imaging provided by coherence controlled holographic microscopy produces images with enhanced information compared to ordinary light microscopy and, due to inherent coherence gate effect, enables observation of live cancer cells' activity even in scattering milieu such as the 3D collagen matrix. Exploiting the dynamic phase differences method, we for the first time describe dynamics of differences in cell mass distribution in 3D migrating mesenchymal and amoeboid cancer cells, and also demonstrate that certain features are shared by both invasion modes. We found that amoeboid fibrosarcoma cells' membrane blebbing is enhanced upon constriction and is also occasionally present in mesenchymally invading cells around constricted nuclei. Further, we demonstrate that both leading protrusions and leading pseudopods of invading fibrosarcoma cells are defined by higher cell mass density. In addition, we directly document bundling of collagen fibres by protrusions of mesenchymal fibrosarcoma cells. Thus, such a non-invasive microscopy offers a novel insight into cellular events during 3D invasion."

These were used to observe and quantify, time until cellular growth and confluence on the posterior capsule. After culture, histological sections were stained for H&E, alpha-SMA, Ki-67 and vimentin and evaluated. We prevented cellular growth in 50% of H(2)Od and 58% H(2)O(2) of treated samples. The overall prevention of cell growth compared to cultured controls was significant for both treatments while there was no significant difference between them. In the cases where cellular growth was not prevented, both treatments significantly delay cellular growth. Until day 28 none of the treated samples of either type that had shown growth reached total confluence. All cultured controls reached total confluence before treated samples (median = day 11.5). Also, histologically, there was a clear morphological difference between cultured controls and treated samples."

Therefore, comprehensive and reliable analyses of these properties are required by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). In this study, we compare two most commonly used approaches for assessing the size distribution and morphology of liposomal nano-drug systems, namely, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM); an automated quantitative analysis method was developed for the latter method. We demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of each of these two approaches for a commercial formulation of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin - Doxil(R), in which the drug is encapsulated, mostly in the form of nano-rod crystals. With increasing drug concentration, these nano-rods change the shape of the liposomes from spherical, before drug loading, to prolate (oval), post drug loading. Cryo-TEM analysis provides a detailed size distribution of both the liposomes (minor and major axes) and the nano-rod drug. Both these values are relevant to the drug performance. In this study, we show that at elevated drug concentration (2.75 mg/ml) the drug grows mainly along the major axis and that this high concentration can result, in some cases, in liposome rupture. We show that the combination of cryo-TEM and DLS constitutes a reliable tool for demonstrating the stability of the formulation in human plasma at body temperature, a characteristic that is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy."

While endocrine drugs proved to be of insufficient therapeutic value in the past, recent clinical research shows promising results by using combinational regimens and pre-clinical studies and identified potential novel endocrine targets. Relevant pre-clinical models can accelerate research in this area. In the present study we describe an orthotopic and estrogen dependent xenograft mouse model of EC. Tumours were induced in one uterine horn of female athymic nude mice using the well-differentiated human endometrial adenocarcinoma Ishikawa cell line-modified to express the luciferase gene for bioluminescence imaging (BLI). BLI and contrast-enhanced computed-tomograph (CE-CT) were used to measure non-invasive tumour growth. Controlled estrogen exposure was achieved by the use of MedRod implants releasing 1.5 mug/d of 17beta-estradiol (E2) in ovariectomized mice. Stable E2 serum concentration was demonstrated by LC-MS/MS. Induced tumours were E2 responsive as increased tumour growth was observed in the presence of E2 but not placebo, assessed by BLI, CE-CT, and tumour weight at sacrifice. Metastatic spread was assessed macroscopically by BLI and histology and was seen in the peritoneal cavity, in the lymphovascular space, and in the thoracic cavity. In conclusion, we developed an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of EC that exhibits the most relevant features of human disease, regarding metastatic spread and estrogen dependency. This model offers an easy to manipulate estrogen dosage (by simply adjusting the MedRod implant length), image-guided monitoring of tumour growth, and objectively measurable endpoints (including tumour weight). This is an excellent in vivo tool to further explore endocrine drug regimens and novel endocrine drug targets for EC."

The results presented in this study were obtained using a set of 50 images of single villi originating from 13 histological slides and was compared with the manual evaluation of the pathologist. In the presented experiments, various structures, such as villi, villous mesenchyme, trophoblast, collagen, and vessels have been recognized. Moreover, the gradation of villous edema for three classes (no villous edema, moderate villous edema, and massive villous edema) has been conducted. Villi images were correctly identified in 98.21%, villous mesenchyme was correctly identified in 83.95%, and the villi evaluation was correct in 74% for the edema degree and 86% for the number of vessels. The presented segmentation method may serve as a support for current manual diagnosis methods and reduce the bias related to individual, subjective assessment of experts."

Yet a whole-field, 3-dimensional (3D) measurement and characterization of fully hydrated dentin in both macro- and micro-scales remain to be a challenge. This study was conducted in 2 stages. In stage-1, a stereo-digital image correlation approach was utilized to determine the water-loss and load-induced 3D deformations of teeth in a sagittal section over consecutively acquired frames, from a fully hydrated state to nonhydrated conditions for a period up to 2 hours. The macroscale analysis revealed concentrated residual deformations at the dentin-enamel-junction and the apical regions of root in the direction perpendicular to the dentinal tubules. Significant difference in the localized deformation characteristics was observed between the inner and outer aspects of the root dentin. During quasi-static loadings, further increase in the residual deformation was observed in the dentin. In stage-2, dentin microstructural variations induced by dynamic water-loss were assessed with environmental scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), showing that the dynamic water-loss induced distention of dentinal tubules with concave tubular edges, and concurrent contraction of intertubular dentin with convex profile. The findings from the current macro- and micro-scale analysis provided insight on the free-water-loss induced regional deformations and ultrastructural changes in human dentin."

A dermatoscope is a tool that captures lesion images with high resolution and is one of the main clinical tools to diagnose, evaluate and monitor this disease. This paper presents a new approach to classify melanoma automatically using structural co-occurrence matrix (SCM) of main frequencies extracted from dermoscopy images. The main advantage of this approach consists in transform the SCM in an adaptive feature extractor improving his power of discrimination using only the image as parameter. The images were collected from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2016, 2017 and Pedro Hispano Hospital (PH2) datasets. Specificity (Spe), sensitivity (Sen), positive predictive value, F Score, Harmonic Mean, accuracy (Acc) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to verify the efficiency of the SCM. The results show that the SCM in the frequency domain work automatically, where it obtained better results in comparison with local binary patterns, gray-level co-occurrence matrix and invariant moments of Hu as well as compared with recent works with the same datasets.

The diversity of clinical presentations and the histopathological features have made diagnosis of such lymphomas a complex task for specialists. Computer aided diagnosis systems employ computational vision and image processing techniques, which contribute toward the detection, diagnosis and prognosis of digitised images of histological samples. Studies aimed at improving the understanding of morphological and non-morphological features for classification of lymphoma remain a challenge in this area. This work presents a new approach for the classification of information extracted from morphological and non-morphological features of nuclei of lymphoma images. We extracted data of the RGB model of the image and employed contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation and 2D order-statistics filter methods to enhance the contrast and remove noise. The regions of interest were identified by the global thresholding method. The flood-fill and watershed techniques were used to remove the small false positive regions. The area, extent, perimeter, convex area, solidity, eccentricity, equivalent diameter, minor axis and major axis measurements were computed for the regions detected in the nuclei. In the feature selection stage, we applied the ANOVA, Ansari-Bradley and Wilcoxon rank sum methods. Finally, we employed the polynomial, support vector machine, random forest and decision tree classifiers in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The non-morphological features achieved higher AUC and AC values for all cases: the obtained rates were between 95% and 100%. These results are relevant, especially when we consider the difficulties of clinical practice in distinguishing the studied groups. The proposed approach is useful as an automated protocol for the diagnosis of lymphoma histological tissue."

Localization, the timing of interactions and changes in cellular structure are all crucial to ensure the correct assembly, function and regulation of protein complexes(1-4). Imaging of live cells can reveal protein distributions and dynamics but experimental and theoretical challenges have prevented the collection of quantitative data, which are necessary for the formulation of a model of mitosis that comprehensively integrates information and enables the analysis of the dynamic interactions between the molecular parts of the mitotic machinery within changing cellular boundaries. Here we generate a canonical model of the morphological changes during the mitotic progression of human cells on the basis of four-dimensional image data. We use this model to integrate dynamic three-dimensional concentration data of many fluorescently knocked-in mitotic proteins, imaged by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy-calibrated microscopy(5). The approach taken here to generate a dynamic protein atlas of human cell division is generic; it can be applied to systematically map and mine dynamic protein localization networks that drive cell division in different cell types, and can be conceptually transferred to other cellular functions."

In the acoustic resolution mode, where the imaging resolution is given by the properties of the transducer, there are various challenges related to the choice of sensors and the optimization of the illumination. These are addressed by linking a Monte Carlo simulation of energy deposition to a time-domain model of acoustic propagation and detection. In this model, the spatial and electrical impulse responses of the focused transducer are combined with a model of acoustic attenuation in a single response matrix, which is used to calculate detector signals from a volumetric distribution of absorbed energy density. Using the radial symmetry of the detector, the calculation yields a single signal in less than a second on a standard personal computer. Various simulation results are shown, comparing different illumination geometries and demonstrating spectral imaging. Finally, simulation results and experimental images of an optically characterized phantom are compared, validating the accuracy of the model. The proposed method will facilitate the design of photoacoustic imaging devices and will be used as an accurate forward model for iterative reconstruction techniques."

Here we present a method that enables the microscopic imaging of the entire spectrum of intracellular transport on a broad time scale without the need for prior labeling. We show that from the time-dependent fluctuation of pixel intensity, in either bright-field or phase-contrast microscopic images, a scaling factor can be derived that reflects the local Hurst coefficient (H), the value of which reveals the microscopic mechanisms of intracellular motion. The Hurst coefficient image of the interphase cell displays an unexpected, overwhelming superdiffusion (H > 0.5) in the cytoplasm and subdiffusion (H < 0.5) in the nucleus, and provides unprecedented sensitivity in detecting transport processes associated with the living state."

In this study, we systematically measure the topography of multiple immune cell types in 965 histological tissue slides from N = 177 patients in a pan-cancer cohort. We provide a definition of inflamed ('hot'), non-inflamed ('cold') and immune excluded patterns and investigate how these patterns differ between immune cell types and between cancer types. In an independent cohort of N = 287 colorectal cancer patients, we show that hot, cold and excluded topographies for effector lymphocytes (CD8) and tumor-associated macrophages (CD163) alone are not prognostic, but that a bivariate classification system can stratify patients. Our study adds evidence to consider immune topographies as biomarkers for patients with solid tumors."

This type of cancer is complex; it is a hereditary disease and does not result from a single cause. The diagnosis of cancer starts with a biopsy. Various methods are used to detect and recognize cancer cells, from microscopic images and mammography to ultrasonography and magnetic resonance images (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS Detection and characterization of benign and malignant cells by image-processing-based segmentation for breast cancer diagnosis is important for early diagnosis. In the present study, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classification was performed for 9 features based on image segmentation in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data set in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository database. RESULTS The results obtained with the developed method were compared with the results of other machine learning methods (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network) and it showed the highest performance, with a result of 98.99%. CONCLUSIONS It was found that both accuracy and speed were good. We present a method that can be applied in cell morphology detection and classification in automated systems that classify by computer-aided mammogram image features."

However, the exact whole brainstem structural changes in vivo have not yet been identified in medication-overuse headache (MOH) transformed from migraine. The aim of this study was to investigate the regional volume changes over the whole brainstem in the MOH patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in vivo. METHODS: High-resolution three-dimensional structural images were obtained using a 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance system from 36 MOH patients and 32 normal controls (NCs) who were consecutively recruited from the International Headache Center, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, from March 2013 to June 2016. VBM was used to assess the brainstem structural alteration in the MOH patients, and voxel-wise correlation was performed to evaluate the relationship with the clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The brainstem region with increased volume located in the left ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (MNI coordinate: -1, -33, -8), ventral tegmental area (MNI coordinate: 0, -22, -12), bilateral substantia nigra (MNI coordinate: -8, -16, -12, 9, -16, -12), and trigeminal root entry zone (MNI coordinate: -19, -29, -31; 19, -32, -29) in MOH patients compared with NCs. The headache visual analog scale score was positively related with the left rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) (MNI coordinate: -1, -37, -56; cluster size: 20; r = 0.602) in the MOH patients. CONCLUSIONS: The regional volume gain of brainstem could underlie the neuromechanism of impaired ascending and descending pathway in the MOH patients, and the left RVM volume alteration could imply the impaired tolerance of nociceptive pain input and could be used to assess the headache disability in the MOH patients."

At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives.

Epub 2017 Nov 29.,Jeong H,Joint Bone Spine,2018,2017/12/04,,,10.1016/j.jbspin.2017.11.008,"OBJECTIVES: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) encompasses a group of disorders including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis. SpA pathogenesis is still not well understood. Animal models are important for studying disease mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic agents. Recently, a beta-glucan-induced SKG mouse was used as an animal model for SpA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and molecular characteristics of a zymosan-induced SKG mouse. METHODS: Zymosan was injected intraperitoneally into SKG mice. Clinical arthritis scores were measured, and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) small-animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was performed to quantify joint inflammation. Histologic features of the joints, intestines, skin, and eyes were evaluated. Inflammatory cytokine and Wnt inhibitor expression was measured in mouse serum. RESULTS: Zymosan exposure triggered SpA-like diseases in SKG mice, including peripheral arthritis, spondylitis, dactylitis, enteritis, and psoriatic skin lesions. (18)F-FDG uptake was significantly higher in the zymosan-treated mice compared with controls. The expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and Dickkopf-1 increased significantly, while IL-4 and sclerostin expression decreased significantly in zymosan-induced mice compared with control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Zymosan-induced SKG mice developed articular and extra-articular features as well as molecular changes that resembled those of human SpA. These findings suggest that the zymosan-induced SKG mouse is a good animal model to reflect the complex features of human SpA."

To further test this hypothesis we have measured the axial material stiffness and quantified the collagen lamellar complexity in ectatic and mechanically weakened keratoconus corneas (KC). METHODS: Acoustic radiation force elastic microscopy (ARFEM) was used to probe the axial mechanical properties of the cone region of three donor KC buttons. 3 Dimensional second harmonic generation microscopy (3D-SHG) was used to qualitatively evaluate lamellar organization in 3 kC buttons and quantitatively measure lamellar branching point density (BPD) in a separate KC button that had been treated with epikeratophakia (Epi-KP). RESULTS: The mean elastic modulus for the KC corneas was 1.67 +/- 0.44 kPa anteriorly and 0.970 +/- 0.30 kPa posteriorly, substantially below that previously measured for normal human cornea. 3D-SHG of KC buttons showed a simplified collagen lamellar structure lacking noticeable angled lamellae in the region of the cone. BPD in the anterior, posterior, central and paracentral regions of the KC cornea were significantly lower than in the overlying Epi-KP lenticule. Additionally, BPD in the cone region was significantly lower than the adjacent paracentral region in the KC button. CONCLUSIONS: The KC cornea exhibits an axial gradient of mechanical stiffness and a BPD that appears substantially lower in the cone region compared to normal cornea. The findings reinforce the hypothesis that collagen architecture may control corneal mechanical stiffness and hence corneal shape."

However, as a special form of bisphosphonate, the antiosteoporotic effect of (99)Tc-MDP is unclear. We systematically investigated the effects of (99)Tc-MDP on cancellous and cortical bone, respectively, in glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIO) animal models. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: blank, negative control, high dose, medium dose, low dose, and positive control groups. After dexamethasone was given to all groups except the blank group to induce osteoporosis, the rats in different groups were treated with saline, MDP, or different doses of (99)Tc-MDP. After treatment, all rats were sacrificed, and their tibiae and femora were analyzed with microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), histology and biomechanics. Micro-CT analyses showed that (1) (99)Tc-MDP reversed glucocorticoid induced bone microarchitecture destruction by increasing BV/TV, Tb.Th, and Tb.N and decreasing BS/BV, Tb.Sp, and TBPf; (2) effect of (99)Tc-MDP increased as its dosage increased; and (3) (99)Tc-MDP could improve cortical bone thickness while MDP failed to do so. Micro-CT spatial structure analysis and histology also yielded consistent results, indicating that (99)Tc-MDP increased trabecular number and connectivity morphologically. Secondly, biomechanics revealed that (99)Tc-MDP can enhance the extrinsic stiffness of bone by changing bone geometry. Finally, (99)Tc-MDP could inhibit osteoclastogenesis in PBMCs in human. In conclusion, (99)Tc-MDP exerted antiosteoporotic effect by improving both cancellous and cortical bone, as well as increasing extrinsic bone stiffness which might be attributed to the its inhibition of osteoclast differentiation. The antiosteoporotic effect of (99)Tc-MDP may suggest a potential clinical application for patients with GIO."

In fact, an arterial wall lesion centered on the accumulation of cholesterol-rich lipids and the accompanying inflammatory response generates a plaque, whose rupture may result in a thrombus with fatal consequences. Plaque characterization for assessing the severity of atherosclerosis is generally performed through standard histopathological examination based on hematoxylin/eosin staining, which is operator-dependent and requires relatively long procedures. In this framework, nonlinear optical microscopy is a valid, label-free alternative to standard diagnostic methods. We combined second-harmonic generation (SHG), two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in a multimodal scheme for obtaining morphological and molecular information on human carotid ex vivo specimens affected by atherosclerosis. In this study, discrimination between different tissues within the atherosclerotic plaque was achieved based on both lifetime, TPEF-to-SHG ratio, and image pattern analysis. The presented methodology aims to be a starting point for future fully automated and fast characterization of atherosclerotic biopsies; moreover, it could be extended to the study of other tissues and pathologies.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the positive predictive value (PPV) of optoacoustic ultrasound features in benign and malignant masses. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this study, 92 masses assessed as BI-RADS category 3, 4, or 5 in 94 subjects were imaged with optoacoustic ultrasound. Each mass was scored by seven blinded independent readers according to three internal features in the tumor interior and two external features in its boundary zone and periphery. Mean and median optoacoustic ultrasound scores were compared with histologic findings for biopsied masses and nonbiopsied BI-RADS category 3 masses, which were considered benign if they were stable at 12-month follow-up. Statistical significance was analyzed using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test with a 0.05 significance level. RESULTS: Mean and median optoacoustic ultrasound scores for all individual internal and external features, as well as summed scores, were higher for malignant masses than for benign masses (p < 0.0001). High external scores, indicating increased hemoglobin and deoxygenation and abnormal vessel morphologic features in the tumor boundary zone and periphery, better distinguished benign from malignant masses than did high internal scores reflecting increased hemoglobin and deoxygenation within the tumor interior. CONCLUSION: High optoacoustic ultrasound scores, particularly those based on external features in the boundary zone and periphery of breast masses, have high PPVs for malignancy and, conversely, low optoacoustic ultrasound scores have low PPV for malignancy. The functional component of optoacoustic ultrasound may help to overcome some of the limitations of morphologic overlap in the distinction of benign and malignant masses."

Materials and Methods Projection data from 83 contrast agent-enhanced CT examinations were collected. Metastases were defined by histopathologic analysis or progression and regression. Lower radiation dose configurations were reconstructed at five dose levels with filtered back projection (FBP) and IR (automatic exposure control settings: 80, 100, 120, 160, and 200 quality reference mAs [QRM]). Three abdominal radiologists circumscribed metastases, indicating confidence (confidence range, 0-100) and image quality. Noninferiority was assessed by using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis (noninferiority limit, -0.10) and reader agreement rules, which required identification of metastases identified at routine dose, and no nonlesion localizations in patients negative for metastases, in 71 or more patient CT examinations (of 83), for each configuration. Results There were 123 hepatic metastases (mean size, 1.4 cm; median volume CT dose index and size-specific dose estimate, 11.0 and 13.4 mGy, respectively). By using JAFROC figure of merit, 100 QRM FBP did not meet noninferiority criteria and had estimated performance difference from routine dose of -0.08 (95% confidence interval: -0.11, -0.04). Preset reader agreement rules were not met for 100 QRM IR or 80 QRM IR, but were met for doses 120 QRM or higher (ie, size-specific dose estimate >/= 8.0 mGy). IR improved image quality (P < .05) but not reader performance. Other than 160 QRM IR, lower dose levels were associated with reduced confidence in metastasis detection (P < .001). Conclusion For detection of hepatic metastases by using contrast-enhanced CT, dose levels that corresponded to 120 quality reference mAs (size-specific dose estimate, 8.0 mGy) and higher performed similarly to 200 quality reference mAs with filtered back projection.

Therefore, the goal of the present study is to create an integrated digital forearm and make the raw data available via an open-access database.

After MRI and CT scanning, physiological muscle parameters (e.g. muscle volume, mass, length, pennation angle, physiological cross-sectional area, tendon length) were obtained via detailed dissection. After dissection, muscle biopsies were fixated and confocal microscopy was used to visualize and measure sarcomere lengths. This study provides an integrated anatomical dataset on which complete and accurate musculoskeletal models of the hand can be based. By creating a 3D digital human forearm, including all relevant anatomical parameters, a more realistic musculoskeletal model can be created. Furthermore, open access to the anatomical dataset makes it possible for other researchers to use these data in the development of a musculoskeletal model of the hand."

The multifunctional response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. To investigate the role of RGC-32 in the development of DR, we used human retinal microvascular endothelial cells under high-glucose conditions and type 2 diabetes (T2D) mice (+Lepr(db)/ + Lepr(db), db/db). The results showed that RGC-32 expression increased moderately in human retinal endothelial cells under hyperglycemic conditions. Histopathology and RGC-32 expression showed no significant changes between T2D and control mice retina at 16 and 24 weeks of age. However, RGC-32 expression was significantly decreased in T2D mouse retina compared to the control group at 32 weeks of age, which develop features of the early clinical stages of DR, namely reduced retinal thickness and increased ganglion cell death. Moreover, immunohistochemistry showed that RGC-32 was predominantly expressed in the photoreceptor inner segments of control mice, while the expression was dramatically lowered in the T2D retinas. Furthermore, we found that the level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased (approximately 2-fold) with a concomitant increase in cleaved caspase-3 (approximately 3-fold) in T2D retina compared to control. In summary, RGC-32 may lose its expression in T2D retina with features of DR, suggesting that it plays a critical role in DR pathogenesis."

This multicenter study validated the analytical performance of the cobas m 511 system. METHODS: Repeatability, reproducibility, carryover, mode-to-mode comparison, cytomorphology, WBC clinical sensitivity, and method comparison were analyzed at four clinical sites using residual whole blood clinical samples (n = 2546) and fresh whole blood from healthy volunteers (n = 480). For WBC clinical sensitivity, the cobas m 511 system automated CBC and WBC differential, system flags, cobas m 511 images, and stained cobas m 511 slides were compared with manual microscopy. Sysmex((R)) XN analyzers were used for interinstrument method comparison. RESULTS: Repeatability and reproducibility results showed low variability. There was no significant sample carryover and no difference between open/closed modes. The overall percentage agreement of morphology assessments with manual microscopy (n = 163 samples) was 95.6% for cobas m 511 images and 95.7% for cobas m 511 slides. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting distributional and/or morphological abnormalities were 94.4% and 74.6% for cobas m 511 automated differential, and 95.9% and 73.3% for cobas m 511 image assessment, compared with a manual 400-cell reference differential (n = 439 samples). Some discordance was seen for monocytes and basophils. Correlations between cobas m 511 and Sysmex XN system data were very good (Pearson's R >/= 0.95 for most CBC parameters). CONCLUSION: The cobas m 511 system performs robustly in the clinical laboratory and is suitable for routine clinical use."

Epub 2018 Aug 29.,Bakalova LP,J Bone Miner Res,2018,2018/07/27,,,10.1002/jbmr.3561,"During aging and in osteoporosis, cortical bone becomes more porous, making it more fragile and susceptible to fractures. The aim of this study was to investigate the intracortical compression- induced strain energy distribution, and determine whether intracortical pores associated with high strain energy density (SED) in the surrounding bone matrix have a different morphology and distribution, as well as different remodeling characteristics than matrix with normal SED. Fibular diaphyseal specimens from 20 patients undergoing a jaw reconstruction (age range 41 to 75 years; 14 men and 6 women) were studied. Bone specimens were microCT-scanned, plastic embedded, and sectioned for histology. Three-dimensional microfinite element models of each specimen were tested in compression, and the SED of the bone immediately surrounding the intracortical pores was calculated within a plane of interest corresponding to the histological sections. The SED of a pore, relative to the distribution of the SED of all pores in each specimen, was used to classify pores as either a high or normal SED pore. Pores with high SED were larger, less circular, and were located closer to the endosteal surface of the cortex than normal SED pores (p < 0.001). Histological analysis of the remodeling events generating the pores revealed that the high SED pores compared with normal SED pores had 13.3-fold higher odds of being an erosive (70%) or formative (7%) pore versus a quiescent pore (p < 0.001), 5.9-fold higher odds of resulting from remodeling upon existing pores (type 2 pore) versus remodeling generating new pores (type 1 pore) (p < 0.001), and 3.2-fold higher odds of being a coalescing type 2 pore versus a noncoalescing type 2 pore (p < 0.001). Overall, the study demonstrates a strong relationship between cortical bone mechanics and pore morphology, distribution, and remodeling characteristics in human fibular bone.

Whole slide imaging scanners enable digitization of histology slides to be stored in virtual slide repositories and to be viewed via computers instead of microscopes. Easier and faster sharing of histologic images for teaching and consultation, improved storage and preservation of quality of stained slides, and annotation of features of interest in the digital slides are just a few of the advantages of this technology. Combined with the development of software for digital image analysis, digital slides further pave the way for the development of tools that extract quantitative data from tissue-based studies. This review introduces digital microscopy and pathology, and addresses technical and scientific considerations in slide scanning, quantitative image analysis, and slide repositories. It also highlights the current state of the technology and factors that need to be taken into account to insure optimal utility, including preanalytical considerations and the importance of involving a pathologist in all major steps along the digital microscopy and pathology workflow."

Currently, detection and diagnosis of breast cancer is achieved through a variety of procedures, such as clinical examination, medical imaging, biopsy, and histopathological analysis. In contrast, spectroscopic analysis has a variety of advantages such as being noninvasive, not destroying biological materials, and not requiring additional histological analysis. In this study, various approaches using Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and optical microscopy were used together to differentiate between and characterize normal breast cell lines (MCF-10A) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453). Raman spectra of normal breast cell and breast cancer cell lines confirmed visual differences in the concentrations of various compounds. These spectra were also analyzed using principle component analysis (PCA), and the PCA results showed reliable separation of the three cell lines and the cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453). With these results, optically synchronizing the AFM morphology, the Raman spectroscopy, and the visible RGB optical transmission intensity provided contrasts for not only conformational differences but also intracellular variation between the normal and cancer cell lines. We observed the inherent characteristic that there is no local difference in cancer cells regardless of morphology in a wide range of optical properties such as absorption, scattering and inelastic scattering."

However, the rich morphologies contained and the noise associated makes image restoration, necessary for quantification of the THG images, challenging. Anisotropic diffusion filtering (ADF) has been recently applied to restore THG images of normal brain, but ADF is hard-to-code, time-consuming and only reconstructs salient edges. This work overcomes these drawbacks by expressing ADF as a tensor regularized total variation model, which uses the Huber penalty and the L(1) norm for tensor regularization and fidelity measurement, respectively. The diffusion tensor is constructed from the structure tensor of ADF yet the tensor decomposition is performed only in the non-flat areas. The resulting model is solved by an efficient and easy-to-code primal-dual algorithm. Tests on THG brain tumor images show that the proposed model has comparable denoising performance as ADF while it much better restores weak edges and it is up to 60% more time efficient."

Regarding brain tumor research, this enables visualization of tumor heterogeneity, infiltration patterns and the relationship with the surrounding brain parenchyma. The precise correlation between radiological imaging and post-mortem brains is of special interest. NEW METHOD: We developed a wide-field slide scanner, comprising a microscope, a high-precision remotely controllable x-y-stage, a camera and a computer workstation, for automatically scanning uncommonly large formats. We analyzed whole brain slides of three patients and constructed cellularity heatmaps and fiber tract maps using a custom-made image processing pipeline. RESULTS: The obtained cellularity heatmaps allow for distinguishing compact tumor (5714 +/- 1786 cells/mm(2), mean +/- standard deviation) from white matter (3581 +/- 828 cells/mm(2)) and grey matter (2473 +/- 716 cells/mm(2)). Compared to magnetic resonance imaging, the proposed histopathological work-up (i) reveals a larger zone of tumor infiltration around the compact tumor areas and (ii) shows how pre-existing tracts are displaced by the tumor bulk. Moreover, we highlight differences in the histological tumor growth pattern of two different radiological progression subtypes. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Compared to existing (commercial) solutions, our slide scanning solution is adaptable and cost-efficient. Moreover, we showcase potential clinical applications by mapping whole brain histology to magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: We herein provide instructions on how to (i) construct a custom-built slide scanner capable of scanning arbitrary slide formats, (ii) automatically evaluate the cell density and (iii) perform fiber tracking on whole brain slides."

Epub 2018 Oct 30.,Da Silva AS,Neurourol Urodyn,2019,2018/10/31,,,10.1002/nau.23847,"INTRODUCTION: The sonographic appearance of a levator muscle ""avulsion"" representing the literal detachment of the pubovisceral muscle (PVM) enthesis has been contested. The nature of the levator ani ""avulsion"" is still not fully understood. It is known, that the tensile strength of a tendon is dependent on collagen with increased synthesis of collagen occurring in tissue with increased mechanical load levels. This study aims to perform a quantitative histological evaluation of the PVM enthesis with or without the imaging finding of levator ani ""avulsion"" to determine if there is a difference in the proportion of muscle and collagen. METHOD: Three-dimensional translabial ultrasound for PVM ""avulsion"" was performed on cadavers using a GE Voluson I with a 5-9 MHz electronic probe. Cadavers were meticulously dissected to identify the presence or absence of an anatomical avulsion. The PVM enthesis was excised for further histopathological processing and treated with three different colorations. Quantitative analysis using ImageJ software was conducted to compare tissue composition in samples with or without sonographic ""avulsion."" All stages were performed by two separate investigators blinded to each other's results. The results were analyzed using SPSS v24, IBM. RESULTS: Twenty-three PVM enthesis with histological staining were procured. Ultrasonographic ""avulsions"" were seen in 5/23 PVM enthesis. No anatomical avulsions were seen. There was no difference in the overall muscle or collagen content (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.864). The mean organized skeletal muscle content was 23% in the sonographic ""avulsion"" group versus 62% in the no ""avulsion"" group (Kruskall-Walis, P = 0.02). ""Avulsions"" were associated with a disorganized appearance at histology. CONCLUSION: The tissue composition relating to the proportion of muscle and collagen was not significantly different in specimens with or without sonographic ""avulsions."" However, morphological differences were observed in the organization of the muscle fibres, which requires further evaluation."

The third mummy, dressed in clothes of the 17th century, was not initially identified. METHODS: Accurate bibliographical, taphonomic and anthropological studies allowed the identification of the mummy of Girolamo Macchi, who lived between 1648 and 1734 and worked as ""major writer"", an accountant, for the Hospital. He was present when the corpses of the Rector and his wife were discovered in 1678 and, impressed by this finding, wanted to be buried in the same chapel after his death, which occurred at the age of 86. A complete study, including macroscopic, radiological, isotopic and histological analyses, was performed on the natural mummy of Girolamo. RESULTS: Macroscopic investigation showed a large inguinoscrotal hernia and a good preservation of the internal organs. The circulatory system revealed severe atherosclerosis, with multiple calcifications stenosing the lumen of the vessels, in particular of the lumbar aorta and the iliac arteries. The diagnosis was confirmed by imaging techniques (3D Cone Beam Scan) and by histology. CONCLUSIONS: This case confirms that atherosclerosis is also a disease of ancient times. The presence of atherosclerosis in pre-contemporary individuals could suggest that the disease may not only be uniquely characteristic of a specific diet or lifestyle, but it could be also an inherent component of human ageing."

A specimen-independent approach through tilting has been attempted to increase particle orientation coverage, thus minimizing anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. However, focus gradient is a critical issue hindering tilt applications from being a general practice in single-particle cryo-EM. The present study describes a newly developed geometrically optimized approach, goCTF, to reliably determine the global focus gradient. A novel strategy of determining contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters from a sector of the signal preserved power spectrum is applied to increase reliability. Subsequently, per-particle based local focus refinement is conducted in an iterative manner to further improve the defocus accuracy. Novel diagnosis methods using a standard deviation defocus plot and goodness of fit heatmap have also been proposed to evaluate CTF fitting quality prior to 3D refinement. In a benchmark study, goCTF processed a published single-particle cryo-EM dataset for influenza hemagglutinin trimer collected at a 40-degree specimen tilt. The resulting 3D reconstruction map was improved from 4.1 A to 3.7 A resolution. The goCTF program is built on the open-source code of CTFFIND4, which adopts a consistent user interface for ease of use."

METHODS: We evaluated the performance of ImageSURF, our open-source ImageJ plugin, which considers a range of image derivatives to train image classifiers. We compared ImageSURF to standard image thresholding to assess its reproducibility, accuracy and generalizability when used on fluorescence images of amyloid pathology. RESULTS: ImageSURF segments amyloid-beta images significantly more faithfully, and with significantly greater generalizability, than optimized thresholding. CONCLUSION: In addition to its superior performance in capturing human evaluations of pathology images, ImageSURF is able to segment image sets of any size in a consistent and unbiased manner, without requiring additional blinding, and can be retrospectively applied to existing images. The training process yields a classifier file which can be shared as supplemental data, allowing fully open methods and data, and enabling more direct comparisons between different studies."

We hypothesize that the prolonged physical contact and mechanical pressure induced by the Ortho-K lenses may create lasting inadvertent effects and damages (microangiopathy), and may bring about unwanted changes in the microvasculature of the bulbar conjunctiva. Computer-assisted intravital microscopy (CAIM) was used to view, document (via videotaping) and objectively quantify (via computer-assisted image analysis) the real-time dynamic and morphometric characteristics of the conjunctival microcirculation in long-term (at least over one year) Ortho-K patients (n = 11) and matched non-user control subjects (n = 8). Ortho-K patients were instructed to wear their lenses overnight following standard protocol. During the study, the conjunctival microcirculation of the left eye of all Ortho-K lens users was viewed, frequently re-focused and videotaped, without and with the lens in place, as outlined in Methods. The matched control subjects (non-lens wearing) were videotaped and studied in like manner. The dynamic and morphometric characteristics of each user and control subject were analyzed, quantified and summated as a severity index (SI) collectively for comparison. SI of Ortho-K lens users (4.18+/-1.08) differed significantly from SI of control subjects (1.75+/-1.39, p</=0.05). In addition, changes in the conjunctival microcirculation (e.g., flow velocity, vessel diameter, shape change, etc) were viewed and videotaped immediately after the myopic patients put on the Ortho-K lenses. Eight of the 11 Ortho-K lens users displayed significant percentage changes (p</=0.05) in flow velocity and 10 of 11 displayed significant percentage changes (p</=0.05) in vessel diameter, without and with the Ortho-K lenses. The results clearly indicated that significant microvascular changes via tissue remodeling occurred, and were caused directly by the physical presence of the Ortho-K lenses."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three blinded radiologists independently graded cancer detectability of 300 breast cancers (288 women with dense breasts) on DBT and conventional FFDM images, retrospectively. Hormone status, histologic grade, T stage, and breast cancer subtype were recorded to identify factors affecting cancer detectability. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare cancer detectability by DBT and conventional FFDM. Fisher's exact tests were used to determine differences in cancer characteristics between detectability groups. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine whether the detectability score differed according to cancer characteristics. RESULTS: Forty breast cancers (13.3%) were detectable only with DBT; 191 (63.7%) breast cancers were detected with both FFDM and DBT, and 69 (23%) were not detected with either. Cancer detectability scores were significantly higher for DBT than for conventional FFDM (median score, 6; range, 0-6; p < 0.001). The DBT-only cancer group had more invasive lobular-type breast cancers (22.5%) than the other two groups (i.e., cancer detected on both types of image [both-detected group], 5.2%; cancer not detected on either type of image [both-non-detected group], 7.3%), and less detectability of ductal carcinoma in situ (5% vs. 16.8% [both-detected group] vs. 27.5% [both-non-detected group]). Low-grade cancers were more often detected in the DBT-only group than in the both-detected group (22.5% vs. 10%, p = 0.026). Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-negative cancers were more often detected in the DBT-only group than in the both-detected group (92.3% vs. 70.5%, p = 0.004). Cancers surrounded by mostly glandular tissue were detected less often in the DBT only group than in the both-non-detected group (10% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.016). DBT cancer detectability scores were significantly associated with cancer type (p = 0.012), histologic grade (p = 0.013), T and N stage (p = 0.001, p = 0.024), proportion of glandular tissue surrounding lesions (p = 0.013), and lesion type (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Invasive lobular, low-grade, or HER-2-negative cancer is more detectable with DBT than with conventional FFDM in patients with dense breasts, but cancers surrounded by mostly glandular tissue might be missed with both techniques."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of mMRI from patients with histological diagnosis of glioma (n = 25). (1)H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) was used to label regions of ""pure"" low- or high-grade tumour across image types. Normal brain and oedema characteristics were defined from healthy controls (n = 10) and brain metastasis patients (n = 10) respectively. Probability density distributions (PDD) for each tissue type were extracted from intensity normalised proton density and T(2)-weighted images, and p and q diffusion maps. Superpixel segmentation and Bayesian inference was used to produce whole-brain tissue-type maps. RESULTS: Total lesion volumes derived automatically from tissue-type maps correlated with those from manual delineation (p < 0.001, r = 0.87). Large high-grade volumes were determined in all grade III & IV (n = 16) tumours, in grade II gemistocytic rich astrocytomas (n = 3) and one astrocytoma with a histological diagnosis of grade II. For patients with known outcome (n = 20), patients with survival time < 2 years (3 grade II, 2 grade III and 10 grade IV) had a high-grade volume significantly greater than zero (Wilcoxon signed rank p < 0.0001) and also significantly greater high grade volume than the 5 grade II patients with survival >2 years (Mann Witney p = 0.0001). Regions classified from mMRI as oedema had non-tumour-like (1)H MRS characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: (1)H MRSI can label tumour tissue types to enable development of a mMRI tissue type mapping algorithm, with potential to aid management of patients with glial tumours."

Interestingly, Deltapsi(m) is higher in many cancer cells comparted to healthy noncancerous cell types, providing a unique metabolic marker. This feature has also been exploited for therapeutic use by utilizing drugs that specifically accumulate in the mitochondria of cancer cells with high Deltapsi(m). As such, the assessment of Deltapsi(m) can provide very useful information as to the metabolic state of a cancer cell, as well as its potential for malignancy. In addition, the measurement of Deltapsi(m) can also be used to test the ability of novel anticancer therapies to disrupt mitochondrial metabolism and cause cell death.Here, we outline two methods for assessing Deltapsi(m) in cancer cells using confocal microscopy and the potentiometric fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM). In the first protocol, we describe a technique to quantitatively measure Deltapsi(m), which can be used to compare Deltapsi(m) between different cell types. In the second protocol, we describe a technique for assessing changes to Deltapsi(m) over time, which can be used to determine the effectiveness of different therapeutic compounds or drugs in modulating mitochondrial function."
31782340,"Associations Between Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Value With Pathological Type, Histologic Grade, and Presence of Lymph Node Metastases of Esophageal Carcinoma","Wang Y, Bai G, Guo L, Chen W.",Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2019 Jan-Dec;18:1533033819892254. doi: 10.1177/1533033819892254.,Wang Y,Technol Cancer Res Treat,2019,2019/11/30,PMC6886268,,10.1177/1533033819892254,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application value of apparent diffusion coefficient value in the pathological type, histologic grade, and presence of lymph node metastases of esophageal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients with pathologically confirmed esophageal carcinoma were divided into different groups according to pathological type, histological grade, and lymph node status. All patients underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging scan, and apparent diffusion coefficient values of tumors were measured. Independent sample t test and 1-way variance were used to compare the difference of apparent diffusion coefficient value in different pathological types, histologic grades, and lymph node status. Correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient value and the histologic grade was evaluated using Spearman rank correlation test. Receiver operating characteristic curve of apparent diffusion coefficient value was generated to evaluate the differential diagnostic efficiency of poorly and well/moderately differentiated esophageal carcinoma. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in apparent diffusion coefficient value between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma and in patients between those with and without lymph node metastases (P > .05). The differences of apparent diffusion coefficient value were statistically significant between different histologic grades of esophageal carcinoma (P < .05). The apparent diffusion coefficient value was positively correlated with histologic grade (rs = 0.802). The apparent diffusion coefficient value </=1.25 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s as the cutoff value for diagnosis of poorly differentiated esophageal carcinoma with the sensitivity of 84.3%, and the specificity was 94.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of apparent diffusion coefficient value was contributing to predict the histologic grade of esophageal carcinoma, which might increase lesions characterization before choosing the best therapeutic alternative. However, they do not correlate with pathological type and the presence of lymph node metastases of esophageal carcinoma."

Despite many efforts, current approaches for distinguishing and quantifying such organizations remain limited, especially when these are contained within densely distributed super-resolution data. In theory, higher-order correlation such as the Triple-Correlation function is capable of obtaining the spatial configuration of individual molecular assemblies masked within seemingly discorded dense distributions. However, due to their enormous computational cost such analyses are impractical, even for high-end computers. Here, we developed a fast algorithm for Triple-Correlation analyses of high-content multiplexed super-resolution data. This algorithm computes the probability density of all geometric configurations formed by every triple-wise single-molecule localization from three different channels, circumventing impractical 4D Fourier Transforms of the entire megapixel image. This algorithm achieves 10(2)-folds enhancement in computational speed, allowing for high-throughput Triple-Correlation analyses and robust quantification of molecular complexes in multiplexed super-resolution microscopy."

Epub 2018 Nov 5.,Liang W,Clin Cancer Res,2019,2018/11/07,,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1305,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a nomogram model combing radiomics features and clinical characteristics to preoperatively differentiate grade 1 and grade 2/3 tumors in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET).Experimental Design: A total of 137 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT from two hospitals were included in this study. The patients from the second hospital (n = 51) were selected as an independent validation set. The arterial phase in contrast-enhanced CT was selected for radiomics feature extraction. The Mann-Whitney U test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were applied for feature selection and radiomics signature construction. A combined nomogram model was developed by incorporating the radiomics signature with clinical factors. The association between the nomogram model and the Ki-67 index and rate of nuclear mitosis were also investigated respectively. The utility of the proposed model was evaluated using the ROC, area under ROC curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was used for survival analysis. RESULTS: An eight-feature-combined radiomics signature was constructed as a tumor grade predictor. The nomogram model combining the radiomics signature with clinical stage showed the best performance (training set: AUC = 0.907; validation set: AUC = 0.891). The calibration curve and DCA demonstrated the clinical usefulness of the proposed nomogram. A significant correlation was observed between the developed nomogram and Ki-67 index and rate of nuclear mitosis, respectively. The KM analysis showed a significant difference between the survival of predicted grade 1 and grade 2/3 groups (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The combined nomogram model developed could be useful in differentiating grade 1 and grade 2/3 tumor in patients with pNETs."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with 56 confirmed thyroid nodules underwent preoperative routine magnetic resonance imaging and IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging. The histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed by surgery. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), perfusion fraction f, diffusivity D, and pseudo-diffusivity D* were quantified. Independent samples t test of IVIM-derived metrics were conducted between benign and malignant nodules. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine the optimal thresholds as well as the sensitivity and specificity for differentiating. RESULTS: Significant intergroup difference was observed in ADC, D, D*, and f (p < 0.001). Malignant tumors featured significantly lower ADC, D and D* values and a higher f value than that of benign nodules. The ADC, D, and D* could distinguish the benign from malignant thyroid nodules, and parameter f differentiate the malignant tumors from benign nodules. The values of the area under the curve for parameter ADC, D, and D* were 0.784 (p = 0.001), 0.795 (p = 0.001), and 0.850 (p < 0.001), separately, of which the area under the curve of f value was the maximum for identifying the malignant from benign nodules, which was 0.841 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggested that ADC and IVIM-derived metrics, including D, D*, and f, could potentially serve as noninvasive predictors for the preoperative differentiating of thyroid nodules, and f value performed best in identifying the malignant from benign nodules among these parameters."

OBJECTIVE: The study aims to understand the differences in the structural composition of soft tissue autografts harvested from the lateral palate or the tuberosity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to receive autografts harvested either from palatal or tuberosity sites to augment horizontal volume deficiencies around single-tooth implants. Tissue biopsies were analyzed for histological and histo-morphometric analysis. Picro-sirius red stain was used to evaluate collagen 1 and 3. Also, immuno-histochemical analysis was performed against MMP1, MMP2, cytokeratin-10, cytokeratin-13, and lysine hydroxylase-2. RESULTS: Twenty specimens were harvested from 9 subjects in the lateral palate group (PG) and 11 subjects in the tuberosity group (TG). The percentage of lamina propria represented 51.08% in the PG group and 72.79% in the TG group, while the area of submucosa was minimal in the TG group representing 4.89% of the total sample vs 25.75% in the PG. The total area of COL-1 and 3 in the TG was 1.19 +/- 0.57 and 0.72 +/- 0.44 mm(2), respectively, while in the PG, the corresponding values were 1.4 +/- 0.7 and 1.04 +/- 0.5 mm(2). The immuno-histochemical analysis generally showed a higher expression of LLH-2, MMP2, CYT-10, and CYT-13 in the TG when compared with the PG. CONCLUSION: Tuberosity grafts had a greater percentage of lamina propria and lower percentage of submucosa. The collagen content in the lamina propria was similar for both groups while the immuno-histochemical profile showed differences in the antibody expression of the epithelial cells. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Tuberosity grafts had more lamina propria and less submocusa, which may be beneficial for volume augmentation."

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,Grussu F,Magn Reson Med,2019,2018/09/20,PMC6586052,,10.1002/mrm.27463,"PURPOSE: Time-dependence is a key feature of the diffusion-weighted (DW) signal, knowledge of which informs biophysical modelling. Here, we study time-dependence in the human spinal cord, as its axonal structure is specific and different from the brain. METHODS: We run Monte Carlo simulations using a synthetic model of spinal cord white matter (WM) (large axons), and of brain WM (smaller axons). Furthermore, we study clinically feasible multi-shell DW scans of the cervical spinal cord (b = 0; b = 711 s mm(-2) ; b = 2855 s mm(-2) ), obtained using three diffusion times (Delta of 29, 52 and 76 ms) from three volunteers. RESULTS: Both intra-/extra-axonal perpendicular diffusivities and kurtosis excess show time-dependence in our synthetic spinal cord model. This time-dependence is reflected mostly in the intra-axonal perpendicular DW signal, which also exhibits strong decay, unlike our brain model. Time-dependence of the total DW signal appears detectable in the presence of noise in our synthetic spinal cord model, but not in the brain. In WM in vivo, we observe time-dependent macroscopic and microscopic diffusivities and diffusion kurtosis, NODDI and two-compartment SMT metrics. Accounting for large axon calibers improves fitting of multi-compartment models to a minor extent. CONCLUSIONS: Time-dependence of clinically viable DW MRI metrics can be detected in vivo in spinal cord WM, thus providing new opportunities for the non-invasive estimation of microstructural properties. The time-dependence of the perpendicular DW signal may feature strong intra-axonal contributions due to large spinal axon caliber. Hence, a popular model known as ""stick"" (zero-radius cylinder) may be sub-optimal to describe signals from the largest spinal axons."

Fresh placental tissue was dissected, formalin fixed, clarified using a modified Visikol((R)) protocol and immunolabeled for CD31 (fetal endothelium) and cytokeratin-7 (villous trophoblast) for confocal imaging of the microanatomy. We present a detailed clarification and staining protocol augmented for imaging of nonhuman primate placental tissue. The image stacks generated by this refined staining method and our data acquisition parameters can be analyzed quantitatively to provide insights regarding the villous and vascular micro-anatomy of the placenta."

Epub 2018 Nov 15.,Rohani SA,J Microsc,2019,2018/11/16,,,10.1111/jmi.12768,"OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging (SR-PCI) can be used to visualize the intrascalar structures in implanted human cochleae and to find the optimal combination of the parameters object-to-detector distance (ODD) and beam energy (E) for visualization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three cadaveric implanted human temporal bones underwent SR-PCI with varying combinations of parameters ODD (3, 2 and 1 m) and E (47, 60 and 72 keV). All images were then reconstructed to a three-dimensional (3D) stack of slices. The acquired 3D images were compared using contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the basilar membrane ( CNRBM ) and the electrode array (CNR(E) ) and the standard deviation of the beam streaks ( sigmaS ). Postprocessing calculations were performed using Matlab (Version 2017b, MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, U.S.A.) with a standard significance level p < 0.05 to determine the most optimal combination of parameters. RESULTS: SR-PCI with computed tomography reconstruction provided good visualization of the anatomical features of the implanted cochleae, specifically the exact location of the electrode with respect to the BM. A single-factor ANOVA revealed a significant difference of variance for both CNR(E) and CNR(BM) , but failed to show significance for sigmaS . A two-sample t-test failed to show any significant difference between CNR(E) columns of (3 m, 72 keV) and (2 m, 60 keV). The CNR(BM) was significantly different only at two pairs of columns, when (1 m, 72 keV) was compared against (2 m, 72 keV) and (3 m, 72 keV). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that SR-PCI is a viable method to visualize implanted human cochleae. SR-PCI is less invasive, less labour intensive and is associated with a much lower acquisition time compared to other methods for postimplantation imaging in humans, such as histological sectioning. We found that the optimal combination of E and ODD parameters was 72 keV and 2 m, respectively. These parameters resulted in high-contrast images of the electrode as well as all internal structures of the cochleae. LAY DESCRIPTION: Cochlear implants (CI) are currently the preferred method of treatment for hearing loss. Cochlear implantation surgery involves placement of a metallic, wire-shaped electrode inside the cochlea, the main organ of the human hearing system. Knowledge of the exact location of the electrode after implantation is beneficial in improving the extent of restored hearing. Common clinical imaging modalities such as computed-tomography (CT) are not ideal for providing such information, due to lack of resolution and streaking caused by the metallic electrode. Recent studies have developed algorithms to extract the electrode location from clinical computed-tomography images and have been validated using histology or micro computed-tomography (micro-CT). Synchrotron radiation phase contrast imaging (SR-PCI) is a high-resolution imaging technique used to visualize small structures in three dimensions. Recently, SR-PCI has been shown to be an alternative to histology or micro-CT for imaging the human cochlea. However, it has not been optimized for imaging implanted human cochleae. The main objective of the present work was to find the optimal organization of imaging parameters (i.e., object-to-detector distance and beam energy) for using SR-PCI to image implanted human cochleae. Three cadaveric human cochleae were imaged using five different combinations of imaging parameters at the Canadian Light Source Inc., Saskatoon, SK, Canada. The resulting images were compared both quantitatively and qualitatively. An optimal combination of parameters was found to produce high-contrast images of the both the CI electrode and all internal structures of the cochlea with minimal streaking. SR-PCI is therefore a viable alternative to histological or micro-CT studies for post-surgical imaging of implanted human cochleae."

Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma is a primary liver tumor and its imaging patterns have been poorly investigated. Misdiagnosis for either hepatocellular carcinoma or benign lesions can occur. We aimed to evaluate the enhancement pattern of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma in cirrhosis with imaging techniques and to estimate the risk of misdiagnosis for hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: All histology-confirmed combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma in cirrhosis seen in two Italian centers between 2003 and 2016, in which at least one imaging technique had been performed, was retrospectively collected. The enhancement pattern was analyzed for all available imaging modalities. RESULTS: A total of 37 combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma nodules were identified. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging had been performed in 27, 34, and 17 nodules, respectively. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was at higher risk of misdiagnosis for pure hepatocellular carcinoma than computed tomography (p = 0.005) or magnetic resonance imaging (p = 0.040). Only six of 24 combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma lesions submitted to both contrast-enhanced ultrasound and computed tomography showed coincident patterns; contrast-enhanced ultrasound correctly suggested a condition of malignancy in a higher number of cases than computed tomography (p < 0.001) and magnetic resonance imaging (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound misdiagnosed a higher number of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma as hepatocellular carcinoma than computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, the latter techniques were able to identify features of malignancy less often."

The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis."

This is quite valuable when the surface of interest cannot be further manipulated by cutting or polishing to fit directly under a microscope. Replication by acetate sheets is one of the techniques applied in industrial, metallographic and anthropological wear/examination. Enamel is the outermost protective layer of human teeth and is subjected to mechanical stresses due to the masticatory function; thus, wear is inevitable in human teeth. This relatively inert hard tissue has been reported to possess some properties of both metals and glasses due to its unique delicate microstructure. This study investigated the applicability of replication sheets in registering wear induced features on human enamel surfaces. The sheets replicated wear features successfully with compatibility to use with multiple microscopes. Acetate sheets have a potential in enamel wear replication."

Hepatic SHH detection increases with the diagnosis of NASH. This pilot study was designed to confirm that staining for SHH is useful in NASH diagnosis and determine whether quantification of staining by computer assisted morphometry (CAM) can be used to assess severity of ballooning degeneration. METHODS: SHH was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin-embedded liver sections in subjects (N = 69) with biopsy proven NAFLD and no liver disease (control). Serum samples were also available for these subjects. Post-staining, a digitized image of the section was acquired and an area quantification algorithm was used to quantify the degree of SHH expression. Additionally, circulating M30, M65, and SHH were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Notably, hepatic SHH expression correlated with histologic ballooning degeneration (rho = 0.62, p < 0.0001), steatosis grade (rho = 0.554, P < 0.001), Mallory-Denk bodies (rho = 0.54, P < 0.001), pericellular fibrosis (rho = 0.527, P < 0.001), and lymphocytic infiltration (rho = 0.435, P < 0.0002). Additionally, hepatic SHH expression correlated with circulating M65 (rho = 0.588, p < 0.0001), and circulating M30 (rho = 0.375, p = 0.001), as well as AST and ALT (rho = 0.43, p = 0.0004, and rho = 0.27, p = 0.03, respectively). Further, serum M30 was almost twice as high in NASH patients compared to non-NASH (539.1 +/- 290.8 U/L vs. 287.6 +/- 190.5 U/L; p = 0.0002), while M65 was almost three times higher in NASH patients compared to non-NASH (441.2 +/- 464.2 U/L vs. 162.8 +/- 353.1 U/L, P = 0.0006). Logistic modeling indicates hepatic SHH expression and presence of type 2 diabetes as independent predictors of advanced fibrosis (defined as portal and pericellular fibrosis > 2: OR = 1.986, p = 0.01, and OR = 3.280, p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: Thus, our findings show quantitation of SHH expression by CAM can provide a tool for quantifying changes in hepatocyte injury and assist in unambiguous staging/grading of NASH. Our study showed minimal interobserver variability using CAM based quantification. Once validated, CAM assessment of hepatic SHH could benefit clinical trials or long term outcomes studies of NASH subjects."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, DKI and DWI data for 61 patients with endometrial cancer and 30 patients with a normal endometrium were analyzed, and the mean kurtosis (MK), mean diffusion coefficient (MD) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for the endometrial cancer tissue and normal endometrial tissue were acquired. The parameters for the normal endometrium group (G0) and the endometrial cancer groups (G1, G2 and G3) were compared and analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate each parameter's diagnostic accuracy and threshold. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlations between all parameters and histological grades. RESULTS: The MK values for the G0, G1, G2 and G3 groups increased gradually, while the MD and ADC values decreased gradually. Except for the differences in the ADC values between G0 and G1, the differences among the groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The MK values had the highest diagnostic accuracy in differentiating G0 and (G1 + G2 + G3), G0 and G1, G1 and G2, and G2 and G3 (AUC = 0.93, 0.76, 0.91, 0.91, P < 0.05). MK was maximally correlated with histological grade, followed by MD and ADC (MK > MD > ADC; r = - 0.85, + 0.82, + 0.76, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Both DKI and DWI can be used to evaluate the diagnosis and histological grading of endometrial cancer. Compared with DWI, the DKI model is a more complete mathematical model with more sensitive parameters, which can more effectively evaluate the pathological and physiological characteristics of endometrial cancer."

We aimed to use automated image analysis of hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained sections to identify the association between microenvironmental composition and platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. METHODS: Ninety-one patients with ovarian cancer containing the data of automated image analysis for H&E histological sections were initially reviewed. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients with recurrent disease were finally identified. Among 30 patients with high stromal cell ratio, 60% of the patients had platinum-resistant recurrence, which was significantly higher than the rate in patients with low stromal cell ratio (9.80%, P <  0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed elevated CA125 level after 3 cycles of chemotherapy (P <  0.001) and high stromal cell ratio (P = 0.002) were the negative predictors of platinum-resistant relapse. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the models for predicting platinum-resistant recurrence with stromal cell ratio, normalization of CA125 level, and the combination of two parameters were 0.78, 0.79, and 0.89 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated stromal cell ratio based on automated image analysis may be a potential predictor for ovarian cancer patients at high risk of platinum-resistant recurrence, and it could improve the predictive value of model when combined with normalization of CA125 level after 3 cycles of chemotherapy."

In this study, we propose a new counting method, which consists of three modules including localization, segmentation and classification. The localization of BMC is achieved from a color transformation enhanced BMC sample image and stepwise averaging method. In the nucleus segmentation, both stepwise averaging method and Otsu's method are applied to obtain a weighted threshold for segmenting the patch into nucleus and non-nucleus. In the cytoplasm segmentation, a color weakening transformation, an improved region growing method and the K-Means algorithm are employed. The connected cells with BMC will be separated by the marker-controlled watershed algorithm. The features will be extracted for the classification after the segmentation. In this study, the BMC are classified using the support vector machine into five classes; namely, neutrophilic split granulocyte, neutrophilic stab granulocyte, metarubricyte, mature lymphocytes and the outlier (all other cells not listed). Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation and classification performance with an average segmentation accuracy of 91.76% and an average recall rate of 87.49%. The comparison shows that the proposed segmentation and classification methods outperform the existing methods."

Timely diagnosis and treatment is key to full patient recovery. The Microscopic Observed Drug Susceptibility (MODS) is a test to diagnose TB infection and drug susceptibility directly from a sputum sample in 7-10 days with a low cost and high sensitivity and specificity, based on the visual recognition of specific growth cording patterns of M. Tuberculosis in a broth culture. Despite its advantages, MODS is still limited in remote, low resource settings, because it requires permanent and trained technical staff for the image-based diagnostics. Hence, it is important to develop alternative solutions, based on reliable automated analysis and interpretation of MODS cultures. In this study, we trained and evaluated a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic interpretation of MODS cultures digital images. The CNN was trained on a dataset of 12,510 MODS positive and negative images obtained from three different laboratories, where it achieved 96.63 +/- 0.35% accuracy, and a sensitivity and specificity ranging from 91% to 99%, when validated across held-out laboratory datasets. The model's learned features resemble visual cues used by expert diagnosticians to interpret MODS cultures, suggesting that our model may have the ability to generalize and scale. It performed robustly when validated across held-out laboratory datasets and can be improved upon with data from new laboratories. This CNN can assist laboratory personnel, in low resource settings, and is a step towards facilitating automated diagnostics access to critical areas in developing countries."

Integration of the two imaging modalities can enhance the spatial resolution of the MSI beyond its experimental limits. Patch-based super resolution (PBSR) is a method where high spatial resolution features from one image modality guide the reconstruction of a low resolution image from a second modality. The principle of PBSR lies in image redundancy and aims at finding similar pixels in the neighborhood of a central pixel that are then used to guide reconstruction of the central pixel. In this work, we employed PBSR to increase the resolution of MSI. We validated the proposed pipeline by using a phantom image (micro-dissected logo within a tissue) and mouse cerebellum samples. We compared the performance of the PBSR with other well-known methods: linear interpolation (LI) and image fusion (IF). Quantitative and qualitative assessment showed advantage over the former and comparability with the latter. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential applicability of PBSR in a clinical setting by accurately integrating structural (i.e., histological) and molecular (i.e., MSI) information from a case study of a dog liver."

Neurite outgrowth experiments produce an enormous number of images that require automated measurement; however, the tracking of neurites is easily lost in the automated process due to the intrinsic variability of neurites (either axon or dendrite) under stimuli. We have developed a stochastic random-reaction-seed (RRS) method to identify neurite elongation and branching accurately and automatically. The random-seeding algorithm of RRS is based on the hidden-Markov-model (HMM) to offer a robust enough way for tracing arbitrary neurite structures, while the reaction-seeding algorithm of RRS secures the efficiency of random seeding. It is noteworthy that RRS is capable of tracing a whole neurite branch by only one initial seed, so that RRS is proficient at quantifying extensive amounts of neurite outgrowth images with noisy background in microfluidic devices of biomedical engineering fields. The method also showed notable performance for reconstructing of net-like structures, and thus is expected to be proficient for biomedical feature extractions in a wide range of applications, such as retinal vessel segmentation and cell membrane profiling in spurious-edge-tissues."

UPSC represents a distinct subtype of endometrial cancer which is different in clinical and pathological behaviors from endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) and resembles more to serous ovarian carcinoma. Since tumors of serous papillary of the ovary are hypothesized to stem from cells of the fallopian tube's fimbria, we hypothesized that UPSC may also origin in the fallopian tubes. In our previous study, using a novel method of computerized morphometry of the fimbrial epithelium we have found significant differences between fimbriae of healthy women and serous ovarian cancer patients. In this study we showed the presence of morphologic differences between twenty-four fimbriae from healthy women, and twenty six fimbriae from uterus cancer (13 from UPSC patients and 13 from EEC patients). All fimbriae reported by the pathologist as ""normal"" were subjected to a computerized histomorphometric analysis. Two-step method of computerized histomorphometry, i.e. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) followed by a co-occurrence matrix analysis and an additional analysis of the nuclear symmetry of the tubal fimbrial epithelium were applied. Using these novel methods, we were able to show differences in the morphometric characteristics of the fimbriae in UPSC patients compared to EEC and healthy patients. It is yet to be determined the clinical significance of this observation."

Epub 2018 Sep 8.,Huang Y,J Magn Reson Imaging,2019,2018/09/28,,,10.1002/jmri.26249,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion-kurtosis imaging (DKI) has preliminarily shown promise as a relatively new MRI technique to provide useful information regarding breast lesions, but the diagnostic performance of DKI has not been fully evaluated. PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of DKI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI) and proton MR spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) in differentiating malignant from benign breast lesions independently or jointly, and explore the correlation between DKI-derived parameters and prognostic factors. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: Seventy-one patients with breast lesions (50 malignant, 26 benign). SEQUENCE: DKI, DWI, DCE-MRI, and (1) H-MRS were performed at 3.0T. ASSESSMENT: Mean kurtosis (MK), mean diffusivity (MD), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), BI-RADS category, and choline peaks were analyzed by two experienced radiologists. STATISTICAL TESTS: Student's t-test was used for continuous variables; receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for assessing the diagnostic accuracy of imaging parameters; Spearman or Pearson correlations for assessing the associations between imaging parameters and prognostic factors. RESULTS: MK exhibited higher area under the curves (AUCs) for differentiating malignant from benign lesions than did MD, ADC, DCE, and tCho (0.979 vs. 0.928, 0.911, 0.777, and 0.833, respectively, P < 0.05). MK showed a positive association with Ki-67 expression (r = 0.508) and histologic grades (r = 0.551), whereas MD and ADC were negatively correlated with Ki-67 expression (r = -0.416 and r = -0.458) and histologic grades (r = -0.411 and r = -0.319). Moreover, MK showed relatively higher AUCs compared with MD and ADC in detecting breast cancers with lymph nodal involvement, histologic grades, and Ki-67 expression. DATA CONCLUSION: MK has higher diagnostic accuracy compared with ADC, DCE, and tCho regarding detection of breast cancer. Moreover, DKI shows promise as a quantitative imaging technique for characterizing breast lesions, highlighting the potential utility of MK as a promising imaging marker for predicting tumor aggressiveness.

Yet, it is a rather exhausting process for pathologists to examine the cellular structures manually in this way. Automating this tedious and time-consuming process is an emerging topic of the histopathological image-processing studies in the literature. This paper presents a two-stage segmentation method to obtain cellular structures in high-dimensional histopathological images of renal cell carcinoma. First, the image is segmented to superpixels with simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method. Then, the obtained superpixels are clustered by the state-of-the-art clustering-based segmentation algorithms to find similar superpixels that compose the cell nuclei. Furthermore, the comparison of the global clustering-based segmentation methods and local region-based superpixel segmentation algorithms are also compared. The results show that the use of the superpixel segmentation algorithm as a pre-segmentation method improves the performance of the cell segmentation as compared to the simple single clustering-based segmentation algorithm. The true positive ratio (TPR), true negative ratio (TNR), F-measure, precision, and overlap ratio (OR) measures are utilized as segmentation performance evaluation. The computation times of the algorithms are also evaluated and presented in the study.

Applying cortical thickness (CTH) analysis based on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 60 primary school children and 60 adults, we investigated the CTH distribution of left and right auditory cortex (AC) and primary auditory source activity at the group and individual level. Both groups showed contoured regions of reduced auditory cortex (redAC) along the mediolateral extension of HG, illustrating large inter-individual variability with respect to shape, localization, and lateralization. In the right hemisphere, redAC localized more within the medial portion of HG, extending typically across HG duplications. In the left hemisphere, redAC was distributed significantly more laterally, reaching toward the anterolateral portion of HG. In both hemispheres, redAC was found to be significantly thinner (mean CTH of 2.34 mm) as compared to surrounding areas (2.99 mm). This effect was more dominant in the right hemisphere rather than in the left one. Moreover, localization of the primary component of auditory evoked activity (P1), as measured by MEG in response to complex harmonic sounds, strictly co-localized with redAC. This structure-function link was found consistently at the group and individual level, suggesting PAC to be represented by areas of reduced cortex in HG. Thus, we propose reduced CTH as an in vivo marker for identifying shape and localization of PAC in the individual brain."

Fifty-three patients were scanned with MRI due to suspected prostate cancer. Twenty-eight of them got histological results. First, two readers assessed the structure delineation and image quality based on images of conventional T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (CTD). Second, two readers identified the index lesion together, and then, reader one evaluated the contrast of index lesion on T2WI and signal ratio on apparent diffusion coefficient map. Third, they assigned Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score in consensus for the index lesion. After 4 weeks, the images of MISS were reviewed by the same readers following the same process. Finally, two readers gave preference for image interpretation, respectively. Kappa coefficient, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, paired-sample t-test, Bland-Altman analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used for statistical analysis. The acquisition time of CTD was 6 min and 10 s, while the acquisition time of MISS was 4 min and 30 s. Interobserver agreements for image evaluation were kappa = 0.65 and kappa = 0.80 for CTD and MISS, respectively. MISS-T2WI showed better delineation for seminal vesicles than CTD-T2WI (reader 1: P < 0.001, reader 2: P = 0.001). The index lesion demonstrated higher contrast in MISS-T2WI (P < 0.001). The PI-RADS scores based on CTD and MISS exhibited high ability in predicting clinically significant cancer (area under curve [AUC] = 0.828 vs 0.854). Readers preferred to use MISS in 41.5%-47.2% of cases. MISS showed comparable performance to conventional technique with less acquisition time."

Even though, automated techniques for the quantification of MP and their classification are reported in the literature. However, either reported techniques are imperfect or cannot deal with special issues such as anemia and hemoglobinopathies due to clumps of red blood cells (RBCs). The focus of the current work is to examine the thin blood smear microscopic images stained with Giemsa by digital image processing techniques, grading MP on independent factors (RBCs morphology) and classification of its life cycle stage. For the classification of the life cycle of malaria parasite the k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes and multi-class support vector machine are employed for classification based on histograms of oriented gradients and local binary pattern features. The proposed methodology is based on inductive technique, segment malaria parasites through the adaptive machine learning techniques. The quantification accuracy of RBCs is enhanced; RBCs clumps are split by analysis of concavity regions for focal points. Further, classification of infected and non-infected RBCs has been made to grade MP precisely. The training and testing of the proposed approach on benchmark dataset with respect to ground truth data, yield 96.75% MP sensitivity and 94.59% specificity. Additionally, the proposed approach addresses the process with independent factors (RBCs morphology). Finally, it is an economical solution for MP grading in immense testing."

In this respect, this study aimed to investigate the potential interactions between the alveolar bone formation and tooth eruption by using finite element (FE) methods, and to figure out whether the expanding tooth systems induce shear stresses that lead to alveolar bone formation. 3D geometric surface models were generated from the 3D histological data of the heads of mice (C57 Bl/6J) ranging from stages embryonic (E) to postnatal (P) stages E15 to P20 using the reconstruction software 3-Matic. Bone, dentin, enamel and dental follicle around the primordia were generated and converted into 3D FE models. Models were imported into the FE software package MSC.Marc/Mentat. As material parameters of embryonic dentine, pulp, enamel, dental follicle, and bony structures basically are unknown, these were varied from 1% to 100% of the corresponding known material parameters for humans and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Surface loads were applied to the outside surface of dental follicle ranging from 0.1 to 5.0N/mm(2). The validity of the model was analysed by comparing the activity pattern of the alveolar bone as determined in the histological study with the loading pattern from the numerical analysis. The results show that when varying the surface loads, the distribution of shear stresses remained same, and while varying the material properties of the hard tissues, the location of highest shear stresses remained stable. Comparison of the histologically determined growth regions with the distribution of shear stresses computed in the numerical model showed a very close agreement. The results provide a strong proof to support Blechschmidt's hypothesis that the bone in general is created under the influence of shear forces."

Epub 2019 Jan 2.,Voss M,J Neurooncol,2019,2019/01/04,,,10.1007/s11060-018-03076-w,"INTRODUCTION: Magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of gliomas is assessed by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO), which define new contrast-enhancing lesions as a sign for tumor recurrence. Pseudoprogression after radiotherapy may mimic tumor progression in MRI but is usually limited to the first months after irradiation. We noted a late onset pattern of new contrast-enhancing spots (NCES) appearing years after radiotherapy. METHODS: We prospectively collected 23 glioma patients with 26 NCES (three patients had two separate NCES events) between 2014 and 2016 in our weekly tumor board without further selection by diagnosis, molecular markers or pretreatment. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis revealed a homogeneous collective of young patients (median age of 49 years at NCES) with mainly IDH-mutated glioma (61%). Initial histology showed 26% glioblastoma, 52% grade III and 22% grade II glioma. NCES occurred at late follow-up with a median of 52 months after tumor diagnosis and 30 months after the last radiotherapy. The majority of NCES regressed spontaneously within a median of 10 months (n = 11) or remained stable without further therapy with a median follow-up of 26 months (n = 7). Only 4 NCES developed MRI morphologically into tumor recurrence. Two NCES were resected without any histopathological proof of tumor recurrence, and in 2 other cases NCES were defined as ischemic stroke or radionecrosis. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that the late onset phenomenon of NCES predominantly represents a form of radiation-induced vasculopathy that is different from early pseudoprogression and should be considered especially in younger patients with IDH-mutated glioma before initiation of new therapy."

METHODS: IVCM exams of SNP in DED patients and matched control subjects were performed using Heidelberg Retina Tomograph with the Rostock Cornea Module. The following parameters were obtained with ACCMetrics: corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), corneal nerve total branch density (CTBD), corneal nerve fiber area (CNFA), corneal nerve fiber width (CNFW), and corneal nerve fractal dimension (CNFrD). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare variables. Receiver operating characteristic curves with calculations of the area under the curve (AUC) were used to describe the accuracy of IVCM parameters for discriminating DED patients from controls. RESULTS: Thirty-nine DED patients and 30 control subjects were included. Significantly, lower values of CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL and higher value of CNFW were found in DED patients compared to controls (respectively, 20.5 +/- 8.7 vs 25.4 +/- 6.7 n/mm(2); 25.6 +/- 20.1 vs 37.6 +/- 21.5 n/mm(2); 12.6 +/- 4.4 vs 14.5 +/- 2.9 mm/mm(2); 0.021 +/- 0.001 vs 0.019 +/- 0.001 mm/mm(2); always p < 0.024). CNFW value had the highest diagnostic power in discriminating DED patients (AUC = 0.828). When the diagnosis of DED was made based on either CNFW or CNBD, the sensitivity was 97.4% and the specificity 46.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The software ACCMetrics was able to rapidly detect SNP alterations occurring in the setting of DED and showed good diagnostic performance in discriminating DED patients."

The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the positive predictive value of AD on diagnostic DBT, and evaluate associations between AD characteristics and histopathologic outcomes. METHODS: This IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study included diagnostic DBT exams performed between 1/2014 and 12/2015 that demonstrated AD. Imaging characteristics of AD, corresponding ultrasound and MRI exams, and pathology results were reviewed. Fisher's exact tests and a two-tailed t-test were performed. RESULTS: Seventy-seven cases of AD were visualized in 68 patients (ages 36-78 years, mean 54 years). Core biopsy of 74 cases of AD yielded malignant pathology in 26/74 (35%) tissue samples. Among 48/74 (65%) non-malignant cases of AD, 25 demonstrated a high-risk lesion, including radial scar in 20, with no upgrades to malignancy among 20 high-risk lesions that underwent surgical excision. Among 23 non high-risk causes of benign AD, stromal fibrosis was most common, present in 12 biopsy specimens. Associations between imaging characteristics of AD on DBT and histopathologic outcome were not statistically significant (one-view visualization 3/13 malignant, 10/13 benign, P = 0.52; DBT-only finding 1/11 malignant, 10/11 benign, P = 0.09). Of 48 cases with an ultrasound correlate, 22/48 (46%) were malignant versus 4/26 (15%) cases without an ultrasound correlate (P = 0.01).

Epub 2019 Feb 2.,Zhang Q,Comput Med Imaging Graph,2019,2019/02/18,,,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2019.01.004,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Modern microscopes can acquire multi-channel large histological data from tissues of human beings or animals, which contain rich biomedical information for disease diagnosis and biological feature analysis. However, due to the large size, fuzzy tissue structure, and complicated multiple elements integrated in the image color space, it is still a challenge for current software systems to effectively calculate histological data, show the inner tissue structures and unveil hidden biomedical information. Therefore, we developed new algorithms and a software platform to address this issue. METHODS: This paper presents a multi-channel biomedical data computing and visualization system that can efficiently process large 3D histological images acquired from high-resolution microscopes. A novelty of our system is that it can dynamically display a volume of interest and extract tissue information using a layer-based data navigation scheme. During the data exploring process, the actual resolution of the loaded data can be dynamically determined and updated, and data rendering is synchronized in four display windows at each data layer, where 2D textures are extracted from the imaging volume and mapped onto the displayed clipping planes in 3D space. RESULTS: To test the efficiency and scalability of this system, we performed extensive evaluations using several different hardware systems and large histological color datasets acquired from a CryoViz 3D digital system. The experimental results demonstrated that our system can deliver interactive data navigation speed and display detailed imaging information in real time, which is beyond the capability of commonly available biomedical data exploration software platforms. CONCLUSION: Taking advantage of both CPU (central processing unit) main memory and GPU (graphics processing unit) graphics memory, the presented software platform can efficiently compute, process and visualize very large biomedical data and enhance data information. The performance of this system can satisfactorily address the challenges of navigating and interrogating volumetric multi-spectral large histological image at multiple resolution levels."

Our aim was to develop a tridimensional in vitro model of retinoblastoma vitreous seeds to assess chemotherapy penetration by means of live-cell imaging. Cell cultures from patients with retinoblastoma who underwent upfront enucleation were established and thoroughly characterized for authentication of human tumor origin. The correlation of the in vitro tridimensional structures resembling human spheres and dusts vitreous seeds was established. Confocal microscopy was used to quantify real-time fluorescence of topotecan as a measure of its penetration into different sizes of spheres. Cell viability was determined after chemotherapy penetration. The in vitro spheres and dusts models were able to recapitulate the morphology, phenotype, and genotype of patient vitreous seeds. The larger the size of the spheres, the longer the time required for the drug to fully penetrate into the core (p < 0.05). Importantly, topotecan penetration correlated with its cytotoxic activity. Therefore, the studied tridimensional cell model recapitulated several characteristics of vitreous seeds observed in patients with retinoblastoma and were successfully used to assess live-cell imaging of chemotherapy penetration for drug distribution studies."

Here, we present a modeling tool to predict the likelihood of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using patient specific tumor vasculature biomarkers. A semi-automated analysis was implemented and performed on 3990 histological images from 48 patients, with 10-208 images analyzed for each patient. We applied a histology-based model to resected primary breast cancer tumors (n = 30), and then evaluated a cohort of patients (n = 18) undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, collecting pre- and post-treatment pathology specimens and MRI data. We found that core biopsy samples can be used with acceptable accuracy (r = 0.76) to determine histological parameters representative of the whole tissue region. Analysis of model histology parameters obtained from tumor vasculature measurements, specifically diffusion distance divided by radius of drug source (L/rb) and blood volume fraction (BVF), provides a statistically significant separation of patients obtaining a pathologic complete response (pCR) from those that do not (Student's t-test; P < 0.05). With this model, it is feasible to evaluate primary breast tumor vasculature biomarkers in a patient specific manner, thereby allowing a precision approach to breast cancer treatment."

Structural or functional abnormalities of LC impact several brain regions including cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum and may contribute to depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, as well as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. These disorders are often associated with metal misbalance, but the role of metals in LC is only partially understood. Morphologic and functional studies of LC are needed to better understand the human pathologies and contribution of metals. Mice are a widely used experimental model, but the mouse LC is small (~0.3 mm diameter) and hard to identify for a non-expert. Here, we describe a step-by-step immunohistochemistry-based protocol to localize the LC in the mouse brain. Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and alternatively, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), both enzymes highly expressed in the LC, are used as immunohistochemical markers in brain slices. Sections adjacent to LC-containing sections can be used for further analysis, including histology for morphological studies, metabolic testing, as well as metal imaging by X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM)."

However, there is a lack of accessible methodologies to enable automated imaging and scoring of tissue-specific phenotypes at enhanced resolution. Here, we present the development of an automated imaging pipeline to identify chemical modifiers of glomerular cyst formation in a zebrafish model for human cystic kidney disease. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein Ift172 in Tg(wt1b:EGFP) embryos was used to induce large glomerular cysts representing a robustly scorable phenotypic readout. Compound-treated embryos were consistently aligned within the cavities of agarose-filled microplates. By interfacing feature detection algorithms with automated microscopy, a smart imaging workflow for detection, centring and zooming in on regions of interests was established, which enabled the automated capturing of standardised higher resolution datasets of pronephric areas. High-content screening datasets were processed and analysed using custom-developed heuristic algorithms implemented in common open-source image analysis software. The workflow enables highly efficient profiling of entire compound libraries and scoring of kidney-specific morphological phenotypes in thousands of zebrafish embryos. The demonstrated toolset covers all the aspects of a complex whole organism screening assay and can be adapted to other organs, specimens or applications."

This study evaluated whether the computer-extracted image features of nuclear shapes, texture, orientation, and tumor architecture on digital images of hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue, could help to predict recurrence in INGA patients. METHODS: A tissue microarrays cohort of 160 retrospectively INGA cases were digitally scanned, and randomly selected as training cohort (D1 = 60), validation cohort (D2 = 100 and D3 = 100, D2 and D3 are different tumor TMA spots from the same patient), accompanied with immunohistochemistry data cohort (D3' = 100, a duplicate cohort of D3) and negative controls data cohort (D5 = 100, normal adjacent tissues). After nuclear segmentation by watershed-based method, 189 local nuclear features were captured on each TMA core and the top 5 features were selected by Wilcoxon rank sum test within D1. A morphometric-based image classifier (NGAHIC) was composed across the discriminative features and predicted the recurrence in INGA on D2. The intra-tumor heterogeneity was assessed on D3. Manual nuclear atypia grading was conducted on D1 and D2 by two pathologists. The expression of HER2 and Ki67 were detected by immunohistochemistry on D3 and D3', respectively. The association between manual grading and INGA outcome was analysis. RESULTS: Independent validation results showed the NGAHIC achieved an AUC of 0.76 for recurrence prediction. NGAHIC-positive patients had poorer overall survival (P = 0.017) by univariate survival analysis. Multivariate survival analysis, controlling for T-stage, histology stage, invasion depth, demonstrated NGAHIC-positive was a reproducible prognostic factor for poorer disease-specific survival (HR = 17.24, 95% CI 3.93-75.60, P < 0.001). In contrast, human grading was only prognostic for one reader on D2. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between NGAHIC-positive patients and positivity of HER2 and Ki67 labeling index. CONCLUSIONS: The NGAHIC could provide precision oncology, personalized cancer management."

For decades, researchers have been kept trying to elucidate the mechanism of FL at the molecular level, but rarely involve the study of morphology and medical physics. Traditionally, it was believed that hemodynamic changes occur only when fibrosis occurs, but it has been proved that these changes already show in steatosis stage, which may help to reveal the pathogenesis and its progress. Because the pseudolobules are not formed during the steatosis stage, this phenomenon may be caused by the compression of the liver microcirculation and changes in the hemodynamics. AIM: To understand the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis and to study the hemodynamic changes associated with hepatic steatosis. METHODS: Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups randomly (control group, 2-wk group, and 4-wk group), with 16 mice per group. A hepatic steatosis model was established by subcutaneous injection of carbon tetrachloride in mice. After establishing the model, liver tissue from mice was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), and oil red O stains. Blood was collected from the angular vein, and hemorheological parameters were estimated. A two-photon fluorescence microscope was used to examine the flow properties of red blood cells in the hepatic sinusoids. RESULTS: Oil red O staining indicated lipid accumulation in the liver after CCl(4) treatment. HE staining indicated narrowing of the hepatic sinusoidal vessels. No significant difference was observed between the 2-wk and 4-wk groups of mice on morphological examination. Hemorheological tests included whole blood viscosity (mPas, gamma = 10 s-(1)/gamma = 100 s(-1)) (8.83 +/- 2.22/4.69 +/- 1.16, 7.73 +/- 2.46/4.22 +/- 1.32, and 8.06 +/- 2.88/4.22 +/- 1.50), red blood cell volume (%) (51.00 +/- 4.00, 42.00 +/- 5.00, and 40.00 +/- 3.00), the content of plasma fibrinase (g/L) (3.80 +/- 0.50, 2.90 +/- 0.80, and 2.30 +/- 0.70), erythrocyte deformation index (%) (44.49 +/- 5.81, 48.00 +/- 15.29, and 44.36 +/- 15.01), erythrocyte electrophoresis rate (mm/s per V/m) (0.55 +/- 0.11, 0.50 +/- 0.11, and 0.60 +/- 0.20), revealing pathological changes in plasma components and red blood cells of hepatic steatosis. Assessment of blood flow velocity in the hepatic sinusoids with a laser Doppler flowmeter (mL/min per 100 g) (94.43 +/- 14.64, 80.00 +/- 12.12, and 67.26 +/- 5.92) and two-photon laser scanning microscope (mum/s) (325.68 +/- 112.66, 213.53 +/- 65.33, and 173.26 +/- 44.02) revealed that as the modeling time increased, the blood flow velocity in the hepatic sinusoids decreased gradually, and the diameter of the hepatic sinusoids became smaller (mum) (10.28 +/- 1.40, 6.84 +/- 0.93, and 5.82 +/- 0.79). CONCLUSION: The inner diameter of the hepatic sinusoids decreases along with the decrease in the blood flow velocity within the sinusoids and the changes in the systemic hemorheology."

Therefore, this paper proposes an effective classification model for three types of NHL pathological images, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: There are three main parts with respect to our model. First, NHL pathological images stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) are transferred into blue ratio (BR) and Lab spaces, respectively. Then specific patch-level textural and statistical features are extracted from BR images and color features are obtained from Lab images both using a hierarchical way, yielding a set of hand-crafted representations corresponding to different image spaces. A random forest classifier is subsequently trained for patch-level classification. Second, H&E images are cropped and fed into a pretrained google inception net (GoogLeNet) for learning high-level representations and a softmax classifier is used for patch-level classification. Finally, three image-level classification strategies based on patch-level results are discussed including a novel method for calculating the weighted sum of patch results. Different classification results are fused at both feature 1 and image levels to obtain a more satisfactory result. RESULTS: The proposed model is evaluated on a public IICBU Malignant Lymphoma Dataset and achieves an improved overall accuracy of 0.991 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.998. CONCLUSION: The experimentations demonstrate the significantly increased classification performance of the proposed model, indicating that it is a suitable classification approach for NHL pathological images."

The first critical step toward fully automated high-content image analyses in such studies is to detect all neuronal cells and distinguish them from possible non-neuronal cells or artifacts in the images. Here we investigate the performance of well-established machine learning techniques for this purpose. These include support vector machines, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and generalized linear model classifiers, operating on an extensive set of image features extracted using the compound hierarchy of algorithms representing morphology, and the scale-invariant feature transform. We present experiments on a dataset of rat hippocampal neurons from our own studies to find the most suitable classifier(s) and subset(s) of features in the common practical setting where there is very limited annotated data for training. The results indicate that a random forests classifier using the right feature subset ranks best for the considered task, although its performance is not statistically significantly better than some support vector machine based classification models."

Big Data image analytics require analysis of large databases of high-resolution images using distributed storage and computing resources along with transmission of large amounts of data between the storage and computing nodes that can create a major processing bottleneck. The proposed image compression framework is based on the JPEG2000 Interactive Protocol and aims to minimize the amount of data transfer between the storage and computing nodes as well as to considerably reduce the computational demands of the decompression engine. The proposed framework was integrated into hotspot detection from images of breast biopsies, yielding considerable reduction of data and computing requirements."
30611874,A registration method for improving quantitative assessment in probabilistic diffusion tractography,"Waugh JL, Kuster JK, Makhlouf ML, Levenstein JM, Multhaupt-Buell TJ, Warfield SK, Sharma N, Blood AJ.",Neuroimage. 2019 Apr 1;189:288-306. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.12.057. Epub 2019 Jan 3.,Waugh JL,Neuroimage,2019,2019/01/07,PMC6790978,NIHMS1031575,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.12.057,"Diffusion MRI-based probabilistic tractography is a powerful tool for non-invasively investigating normal brain architecture and alterations in structural connectivity associated with disease states. Both voxelwise and region-of-interest methods of analysis are capable of integrating population differences in tract amplitude (streamline count or density), given proper alignment of the tracts of interest. However, quantification of tract differences (between groups, or longitudinally within individuals) has been hampered by two related features of white matter. First, it is unknown to what extent healthy individuals differ in the precise location of white matter tracts, and to what extent experimental factors influence perceived tract location. Second, white matter lacks the gross neuroanatomical features (e.g., gyri, histological subtyping) that make parcellation of grey matter plausible - determining where tracts ""should"" lie within larger white matter structures is difficult. Accurately quantifying tractographic connectivity between individuals is thus inherently linked to the difficulty of identifying and aligning precise tract location. Tractography is often utilized to study neurological diseases in which the precise structural and connectivity abnormalities are unknown, underscoring the importance of accounting for individual differences in tract location when evaluating the strength of structural connectivity. We set out to quantify spatial variance in tracts aligned through a standard, whole-brain registration method, and to assess the impact of location mismatch on groupwise assessments of tract amplitude. We then developed a method for tract alignment that enhances the existing standard whole brain registration, and then tested whether this method improved the reliability of groupwise contrasts. Specifically, we conducted seed-based probabilistic diffusion tractography from primary motor, supplementary motor, and visual cortices, projecting through the corpus callosum. Streamline counts decreased rapidly with movement from the tract center (-35% per millimeter); tract misalignment of a few millimeters caused substantial compromise of amplitude comparisons. Alignment of tracts ""peak-to-peak"" is essential for accurate amplitude comparisons. However, for all transcallosal tracts registered through the whole-brain method, the mean separation distance between an individual subject's tract and the average tract (3.2 mm) precluded accurate comparison: at this separation, tract amplitudes were reduced by 74% from peak value. In contrast, alignment of subcortical tracts (thalamo-putaminal, pallido-rubral) was substantially better than alignment for cortical tracts; whole-brain registration was sufficient for these subcortical tracts. We demonstrated that location mismatches in cortical tractography were sufficient to produce false positive and false negative amplitude estimates in both groupwise and longitudinal comparisons. We then showed that our new tract alignment method substantially reduced location mismatch and improved both reliability and statistical power of subsequent quantitative comparisons."

The goal of this study was to identify novel intrinsic molecular UUS subtypes using integrated clinical, histopathologic, and molecular evaluation of a large, fully annotated, patient cohort. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifty cases of UUS with full clinicopathologic annotation were analyzed for gene expression (n = 50), copy-number variation (CNV, n = 40), cell morphometry (n = 39), and protein expression (n = 22). Gene ontology and network enrichment analysis were used to relate over- and underexpressed genes to pathways and further to clinicopathologic and phenotypic findings. RESULTS: Gene expression identified four distinct groups of tumors, which varied in their clinicopathologic parameters. Gene ontology analysis revealed differential activation of pathways related to genital tract development, extracellular matrix (ECM), muscle function, and proliferation. A multivariable, adjusted Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that RNA group, mitotic index, and hormone receptor expression influence patient overall survival (OS). CNV arrays revealed characteristic chromosomal changes for each group. Morphometry demonstrated that the ECM group, the most aggressive, exhibited a decreased cell density and increased nuclear area. A cell density cutoff of 4,300 tumor cells per mm(2) could separate ECM tumors from the remaining cases with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 94%. IHC staining of MMP-14, Collagens 1 and 6, and Fibronectin proteins revealed differential expression of these ECM-related proteins, identifying potential new biomarkers for this aggressive sarcoma subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular evaluation of UUS provides novel insights into the biology, prognosis, phenotype, and possible treatment of these tumors."

METHODS: The radiology databases of five facilities were retrospectively searched for reports indicating hemorrhagic hepatic cysts or hepatic cystic tumors. Cases of hemorrhagic hepatic cysts with enhancing mural nodules based on pathological or radiological findings were identified and reviewed. RESULTS: We included 14 cases (11 female and 3 male) with a mean patient age of 72.6 years. Up until the enhancing mural nodules were detected, the cysts had decreased in size in all ten cases for which radiological imaging was available for a period of > 3 years previous to detection. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI showed focal enhancement in the early phase and progressive centrifugal enhancement in the delayed phase in all 16 mural nodules >/= 10 mm in diameter. Thirteen of 14 MRI assessable enhancing mural nodules >/= 10 mm in diameter showed a hypointense rim with central hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging. All cases showed calcification of the cyst wall. In the three referred cases, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/CT demonstrated no intense FDG uptake in the enhancing mural nodules. In the four resected cases, histopathology of the enhancing mural nodules revealed neovascularization within an organized hematoma, including extensive dilated vessels and hemangioma-like lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Features including a decrease in cyst size, a progressive centrifugal enhancing pattern on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, a hypointense rim with central hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI, and cyst wall calcification may indicate a hemorrhagic hepatic cyst."

In this article, we provide an overview of the utility of such technologies in clinical trials and provide a discussion of the potential applications, current challenges, limitations and remaining unanswered questions that require addressing prior to routine adoption in such studies. We reiterate the value of central review of pathology in clinical trials, and discuss inherent logistical, cost and performance advantages of using a digital approach. The current and emerging regulatory landscape is outlined. The role of digital platforms and remote learning to improve the training and performance of clinical trial pathologists is discussed. The impact of image analysis on quantitative tissue morphometrics in key areas such as standardisation of immunohistochemical stain interpretation, assessment of tumour cellularity prior to molecular analytical applications and the assessment of novel histological features is described. The standardisation of digital image production, establishment of criteria for digital pathology use in pre-clinical and clinical studies, establishment of performance criteria for image analysis algorithms and liaison with regulatory bodies to facilitate incorporation of image analysis applications into clinical practice are key issues to be addressed to improve digital pathology incorporation into clinical trials."

Epub 2019 Mar 19.,Senga Y,Anal Chem,2019,2019/03/20,,,10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05979,"Aggregates of therapeutic proteins that can contaminate drug products during manufacture is a growing concern for the pharmaceutical industry because the aggregates are potentially immunogenic. Electron microscopy is a typical, indispensable method for imaging nanometer- to micrometer-sized structures. Nevertheless, it is not ideal because it must be performed with ex situ monitoring under high-vacuum conditions, where the samples could be altered by staining and drying. Here, we introduce a scanning electron-assisted dielectric microscopy (SE-ADM) technique for in-solution imaging of monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) aggregates without staining and drying. Remarkably, SE-ADM allowed assessment of the size and morphology of the IgG aggregates in solution by completely excluding drying-induced artifacts. SE-ADM was also beneficial to study IgG aggregation caused by temporary acid exposure followed by neutralization, pH-shift stress. A box-counting analysis of the SE-ADM images provided fractal dimensions of the larger aggregates, which complemented the fractal dimensions of the smaller aggregates measured by light scattering. The scale-free or self-similarity nature of the fractal aggregates indicated that a common mechanism for antibody aggregation existed between the smaller and larger aggregates. Consequently, SE-ADM is a useful method for characterizing protein aggregates to bridge the gaps that occur among conventional analytical methods, such as those related to in situ/ ex situ techniques or size/morphology assessments."

To obtain high spatial resolution images, we optimized the significant imaging parameters, including scanning speeds, feedback configurations and acoustic frequencies of an AFAM system, to increase the amplitude of the acoustic signal and to stabilize the morphological signals. We also combined the acoustic amplitude and phase signals, and generated pseudo-color figures for better illustration of subcellular features such as pseudopodia, membranes and nucleus-like. The subcellular structural image atlas can describe nanoscale details of multiple samples and provide clearer images of the subcellular features compared to other conventional techniques. This study builds a strong basis of transmission AFAM for cell imaging, which can help researchers to clarify the cell structures in diverse biological fields and push the understanding of biology evolution to a new stage."

To this end, this paper proposed a novel classification framework using the multispace image reconstruction inputs and the transfer learning technology. Specifically, a multispace image reconstruction method was first developed to generate a new image containing three channels composed of gradient, gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and local binary pattern (LBP) spaces, respectively. Then, the pretrained VGG-16 net was utilized to extract the high-level semantic features of original images (RGB) and reconstructed images. Subsequently, the long short-term memory (LSTM) layer was used for feature selection and refinement while increasing its discrimination capability. Finally, the classification task was performed via the softmax classifier. Our framework was evaluated on a publicly available microscopy image dataset of IICBU malignant lymphoma. Experimental results demonstrated the performance advantages of our proposed classification framework by comparing with the related works."

Epub 2018 Jun 6.,Guyader JM,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,2019,2018/07/12,,,10.1109/JBHI.2018.2844361,"Multichannel image registration is an important challenge in medical image analysis. Multichannel images result from modalities such as dual-energy CT or multispectral microscopy. Besides, multichannel feature images can be derived from acquired images, for instance, by applying multiscale feature banks to the original images to register. Multichannel registration techniques have been proposed, but most of them are applicable to only two multichannel images at a time. In the present study, we propose to formulate multichannel registration as a groupwise image registration problem. In this way, we derive a method that allows the registration of two or more multichannel images in a fully symmetric manner (i.e., all images play the same role in the registration procedure), and therefore, has transitive consistency by definition. The method that we introduce is applicable to any number of multichannel images, any number of channels per image, and it allows to take into account correlation between any pair of images and not just corresponding channels. In addition, it is fully modular in terms of dissimilarity measure, transformation model, regularisation method, and optimisation strategy. For two multimodal datasets, we computed feature images from the initially acquired images, and applied the proposed registration technique to the newly created sets of multichannel images. MIND descriptors were used as feature images, and we chose total correlation as groupwise dissimilarity measure. Results show that groupwise multichannel image registration is a competitive alternative to the pairwise multichannel scheme, in terms of registration accuracy and insensitivity towards registration reference spaces."

In this paper, we propose a unified generative adversarial networks architecture with a new formulation of loss to perform robust cell-level visual representation learning in an unsupervised setting. Our model is not only label-free and easily trained but also capable of cell-level unsupervised classification with interpretable visualization, which achieves promising results in the unsupervised classification of bone marrow cellular components.

Demand remains high for annotations of more complex elements in digital microscopic images, such as anatomical structures. Therefore, this paper investigates conditions to enable crowdsourced annotations of high-level image objects, a complex task considered to require expert knowledge. Seventy six medical students without specific domain knowledge who voluntarily participated in three experiments solved two relevant annotation tasks on histopathological images: 1) labeling of images showing tissue regions and 2) delineation of morphologically defined image objects. We focus on methods to ensure sufficient annotation quality including several tests on the required number of participants and on the correlation of participants' performance between tasks. In a set up simulating annotation of images with limited ground truth, we validated the feasibility of a confidence score using full ground truth. For this, we computed a majority vote using weighting factors based on individual assessment of contributors against scattered gold standard annotated by pathologists. In conclusion, we provide guidance for task design and quality control to enable a crowdsourced approach to obtain accurate annotations required in the era of digital pathology."

In this pilot study, we evaluate the potential of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to characterize non-invasively the melanin content, location, and distribution in melasma and assess the elastosis severity. We employed a clinical MPM tomograph to image in vivo morphological features in melasma lesions and adjacent normal skin in 12 patients. We imaged dermal melanophages in most dermal melasma lesions and occasionally in epidermal melasma. The melanin volume fraction values measured in epidermal melasma (14% +/- 4%) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the values measured in perilesional skin (11% +/- 3%). The basal keratinocytes of melasma and perilesions showed different melanin distribution. Elastosis was predominantly more severe in lesions than in perilesions and was associated with changes in melanin distribution of the basal keratinocytes. These results demonstrate that MPM may be a non-invasive imaging tool for characterizing melasma."

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,Du Y,Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants,2019,2018/12/07,,,10.11607/jomi.7179,"PURPOSE: Different navigation markers in dynamic guided implant surgery could cause different degrees of artifacts, which would affect the accuracy and efficiency of the implant navigation system. This study aimed to quantify artifacts caused by navigation markers made of different materials and to evaluate their effects on registration accuracy under various oral conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four U-shaped tubes with different navigation markers (440c stainless steel, silicon nitride, zirconium oxide, and aluminium oxide) were produced by three-dimensional printing. Four kinds of maxillary plaster models were prepared to stimulate four tooth crown conditions. U-shaped tubes combined with different tooth models were scanned using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). The size of artifacts from different navigation markers and registration rate were measured. Abrasion performance of navigation markers was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. RESULTS: Aluminium oxide navigation markers showed the fewest artifacts. Silicon nitride markers caused fewer artifacts than zirconium oxide and 440c stainless steel ones (P < .05) and had the best registration performance under all tooth crown conditions with the lowest volume of abrasion. Registration data suggested aluminium oxide worked badly under artificial crown and natural tooth conditions for its lower radiopacity, and zirconium oxide worked undesirably in edentulous conditions. 440c stainless steel was worst in all dental conditions. CONCLUSION: Navigation markers made of silicon nitride have the best overall performance and perform the best in registration under all circumstances owing to less artifact generation, better radiopacity, and desirable abrasion resistance. Silicon nitride can be regarded as an ideal material, including but not limited to oral implant navigator-guided surgery."

Epub 2019 Feb 11.,Carl B,World Neurosurg,2019,2019/02/15,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.01.202,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated how augmented reality (AR) can be applied to support transsphenoidal surgery. METHODS: AR was established using the head-up displays integrated into operating microscopes. Navigation registration was performed with either fiducial-based or automatic registration using intraoperative computed tomography (iCT). Correct microscope calibration was ensured by checking the geometric overlap between the AR representation of the reference array and the 3-dimensional reality while focusing on the reference array. RESULTS: From a consecutive single-surgeon series of 288 transsphenoidal procedures, 47 patients (16.3%) had undergone microscope-based AR to visualize the target and risk structures. AR was smoothly integrated into the surgical workflow. AR accuracy depended on navigation accuracy and microscope calibration. The target registration error in patients with fiducial-based registration was 2.33 +/- 1.30 mm. Automatic, user-independent iCT-based registration significantly (P < 0.001) increased AR accuracy (target registration error, 0.83 +/- 0.44 mm). Applying low-dose iCT protocols reduced the effective dose caused by iCT registration scanning to within the range of a single chest radiograph (0.041 mSv). No vascular injuries and no aggravation of neurological deficits occurred in the present series. AR greatly facilitated orientation in the reoperations and the patients with anatomical variants, thereby increasing surgeon comfort. Enhanced AR visualizations improved the 3-dimensional perception compared with the standard display of dashed lines by the head-up display of the operating microscope. CONCLUSIONS: Microscope-based AR is a reliable tool to increase patient safety in complicated transsphenoidal procedures. Intraoperative imaging-based automatic patient registration is recommended."

We investigated and compared a group of saltwater drowning and a group of freshwater drowning, while cases of acute external bleeding were investigated as negative control group. Tissue samples from each pulmonary lobe were collected during autopsy and examined by optical microscope. The area of alveolar spaces was calculated by means of image analysis software, recording the mean alveolar area (MAA) for each group. MAA was 24,852 mum(2) in the saltwater drowning group, 34,133 mum(2) in the freshwater drowning group and 21,871 mum(2) in the negative control group. The MAA in freshwater drowning was significantly higher than in saltwater drowning and controls. No statistical differences were observed between saltwater drowning and controls. The results of this study suggest that APE is not a typical sign of death by saltwater drowning."

While there have been significant advances in the field of experimental droplet microfluidics, the development of complementary software tools has lagged. Existing quantification tools have limitations including interdependent hardware platforms or challenges analyzing a wide range of high-throughput droplet microfluidic data using a single algorithm. To address these issues, an all-in-one Python algorithm called FluoroCellTrack was developed and its wide-range utility was tested on three different applications including quantification of cellular response to drugs, droplet tracking, and intracellular fluorescence. The algorithm imports all images collected using bright field and fluorescence microscopy and analyzes them to extract useful information. Two parallel steps are performed where droplets are detected using a mathematical Circular Hough Transform (CHT) while single cells (or other contours) are detected by a series of steps defining respective color boundaries involving edge detection, dilation, and erosion. These feature detection steps are strengthened by segmentation and radius/area thresholding for precise detection and removal of false positives. Individually detected droplet and contour center maps are overlaid to obtain encapsulation information for further analyses. FluoroCellTrack demonstrates an average of a ~92-99% similarity with manual analysis and exhibits a significant reduction in analysis time of 30 min to analyze an entire cohort compared to 20 h required for manual quantification."

Epub 2019 Mar 14.,Vu QD,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2019,2019/05/04,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.03.007,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Segmenting different tissue components in histopathological images is of great importance for analyzing tissues and tumor environments. In recent years, an encoder-decoder family of convolutional neural networks has increasingly adopted to develop automated segmentation tools. While an encoder has been the main focus of most investigations, the role of a decoder so far has not been well studied and understood. Herein, we proposed an improved design of a decoder for the segmentation of epithelium and stroma components in histopathology images. METHODS: The proposed decoder is built upon a multi-path layout and dense shortcut connections between layers to maximize the learning and inference capability. Equipped with the proposed decoder, neural networks are built using three types of encoders (VGG, ResNet and preactived ResNet). To assess the proposed method, breast and prostate tissue datasets are utilized, including 108 and 52 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) breast tissues images and 224 H&E prostate tissue images. RESULTS: Combining the pre-activated ResNet encoder and the proposed decoder, we achieved a pixel wise accuracy (ACC) of 0.9122, a rand index (RAND) score of 0.8398, an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9716, Dice coefficient for stroma (DICE_STR) of 0.9092 and Dice coefficient for epithelium (DICE_EPI) of 0.9150 on the breast tissue dataset. The same network obtained 0.9074 ACC, 0.8320 Rand index, 0.9719 AUC, 0.9021 DICE_EPI and 0.9121 DICE_STR on the prostate dataset. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the experimental results confirmed that the proposed network is superior to the networks combined with the conventional decoder. Therefore, the proposed decoder could aid in improving tissue analysis in histopathology images."

In this study, we visualized the spatiotemporal dynamics of invasion of human GSCs in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model using time-lapse imaging of organotypic brain slice cultures and three-dimensional imaging of optically cleared whole brains. GSCs implanted in the striatum exhibited directional migration toward axon bundles, perivascular area, and the subventricular zone around the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. GSCs migrated in a helical pattern around axon bundles in the striatum and invaded broadly in both the rostral and caudal directions. GSCs in the corpus callosum migrated more rapidly and unidirectionally toward the contralateral side with pseudopod extension. These characteristics of GSC invasion shared histological features observed in glioblastoma patients. Spatiotemporal visualization techniques can contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying GSC invasion that may lead to the development of effective therapy for glioblastoma."
31112562,A novel method for comparison of arterial remodeling in hypertension: Quantification of arterial trees and recognition of remodeling patterns on histological sections,"Gutsol AA, Blanco P, Samokhina SI, Afanasiev SA, Kennedy CRJ, Popov SV, Burns KD.",PLoS One. 2019 May 21;14(5):e0216734. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0216734. eCollection 2019.,Gutsol AA,PLoS One,2019,2019/05/22,PMC6529011,,10.1371/journal.pone.0216734,"Remodeling of spatially heterogeneous arterial trees is routinely quantified on tissue sections by averaging linear dimensions, with lack of comparison between different organs and models. The impact of experimental models or hypertension treatment modalities on organ-specific vascular remodeling remains undefined. A wide variety of arterial remodeling types has been demonstrated for hypertensive models, which include differences across organs. The purpose of this study was to reassess methods for measurement of arterial remodeling and to establish a morphometric algorithm for standard and comparable quantification of vascular remodeling in hypertension in different vascular beds. We performed a novel and comprehensive morphometric analysis of terminal arteries in the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, intestine, skin, skeletal muscle, and adrenal glands of control and Goldblatt hypertensive rats on routinely processed tissue sections. Mean dimensions were highly variable but grouping them into sequential 5 mum intervals permitted creation of reliable linear regression equations and complex profiles. Averaged arterial dimensions demonstrated seven remodeling patterns that were distinct from conventional inward-outward and hypertrophic-eutrophic definitions. Numerical modeling predicted at least nineteen variants of arterial spatial conformations. Recognition of remodeling variants was not possible using averaged dimensions, their ratios, or the remodeling and growth indices. To distinguish remodeling patterns, a three-dimensional modeling was established and tested. The proposed algorithm permits quantitative analysis of arterial remodeling in different organs and may be applicable for comparative studies between animal hypertensive models and human hypertension. Arterial wall tapering is the most important factor to consider in arterial morphometry, while perfusion fixation with vessel relaxation is not necessary. Terminal arteries in organs undergo the same remodeling pattern in Goldblatt rats, except for organs with hemodynamics affected by the arterial clip. The existing remodeling nomenclature should be replaced by a numerical classification applicable to any type of arterial remodeling."

Based on the stretch-stress characteristic of muscle activation when the eccentric contraction is considered, a specifically defined phenomenological strain-energy function was used, as well as the Holzapfel-type strain-energy function for the passive part. A continuum mechanical framework, including the stress tensor and elasticity tensor, was obtained, based on the defined strain-energy function. The model parameters were obtained by fitting the constitutive model to experimental test data. Three-dimensional patient-specific geometry was modeled, accounting for the muscle tissue layer and based on the quantitative histology study of the soft palate. Anatomically representative boundary conditions for the finite element calculation were also considered. Palatal muscle activation level (electromyographic data) versus the negative pressure was defined in the simulations, and the patients' activation level was set to be lower than for the healthy people. The simulation results showed that reduced in activation level for the patients causes a less negative closing pressure, and this makes the soft palate more prone to collapse. In addition, if we account for the passive-active transfer displayed as the muscle contraction corresponding to the neurogenic reflex in the soft palate, the collapse is prevented. This numerical representation of the reduced activation for the OSA patients may provide increased understanding of OSA physiology."

Epub 2018 Dec 13.,Zhang MC,Eur Radiol,2019,2018/12/15,,,10.1007/s00330-018-5848-6,"OBJECTIVES: Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides information on both perfusion and diffusion and has been used to evaluate Crohn's disease (CD) activity and fibrosis in children; however, there are no reports on its use in adults. We aimed to determine its value for detecting and grading intestinal fibrosis in adults with CD compared with contrast-enhanced imaging and traditional diffusion-weighted imaging using surgical histopathology as a reference standard. METHODS: Twenty-four adults with CD underwent preoperative IVIM, traditional diffusion-weighted, and contrast-enhanced imaging. Region-by-region correlations between MRI findings and histologic findings of the surgical specimens were performed. Imaging parameters including fractional perfusion, perfusion coefficient, and diffusion coefficient for IVIM and apparent diffusion coefficient value for traditional diffusion-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced parameter of 95 bowel lesions were measured. Intestinal fibrosis was histologically scored from 0 to 3. RESULTS: The fractional perfusion (r = - 0.629, p < 0.001) and apparent diffusion coefficient values (r = - 0.495, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with fibrosis scores. Fractional perfusion decreased following increases in fibrosis severity from mild, to moderate, to severe (p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing moderate-severe from mild fibrosis was 0.876 (p < 0.001) for fractional perfusion, followed by 0.802 for apparent diffusion coefficient value (p < 0.001). Perfusion coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and contrast-enhanced parameter were uncorrelated with histological fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: IVIM diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging outperforms traditional diffusion-weighted and contrast-enhanced imaging in grading bowel fibrosis, and fractional perfusion may be a promising biomarker for fibrosis severity in adults with CD. KEY POINTS: * Intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted MRI outperforms contrast-enhanced imaging and traditional diffusion-weighted MRI for detecting and grading intestinal fibrosis in adult Crohn's disease. * The parameter fractional perfusion, a promising biomarker for fibrosis severity, may be beneficial for treatment planning and monitoring of bowel fibrosis in adult Crohn's disease. * Perfusion coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and the percentage of enhancement gain between 70 s and 7 min were uncorrelated with histological fibrosis."

The main challenge lies in the subtle differences in morphologic characteristics among these classes, which requires a refined segmentation. A new efficient segmentation framework has been developed, which uses the image color information through fuzzy clustering of different color components and the application of the watershed transformation with markers. The final result is the separation of three regions of interest: nucleus, entire cell, and peripheral zone around the cell. Segmentation of this zone is crucial to extract a new feature to identify cells with hair-like projections. The segmentation is validated, using a database of 4758 cell images with normal, reactive lymphocytes and five types of malignant lymphoid cells from blood smears of 105 patients, in two ways: (1) the efficiency in the accurate separation of the regions of interest, which is 92.24%, and (2) the accuracy of a classification system implemented over the segmented cells, which is 91.54%. In conclusion, the proposed segmentation framework is suitable to distinguish among abnormal blood cells with subtile color and spatial similarities. Graphical Abstract The segmentation framework uses the image color information through fuzzy clustering of different color components and the application of the watershed transformation with markers (Top). The final result is the separation of three regions of interest: nucleus, entire cell, and peripheral zone around the cell. The procedure is also validated by the implementation of a system to automatically classify different types of abnormal blood cells (Bottom)."

First, curcumin-stained brain slices of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease were examined. Amyloid-beta plaques were identified based on the fluorescence of curcumin, and coregistered morphological images of the brain tissue were provided by the OCM channel. Second, human brain tumor biopsies retrieved intraoperatively were imaged prior to conventional neuropathologic work-up. OCM revealed the three-dimensional structure of the brain parenchyma, and FI added the tumor tissue-specific contrast. Attenuation coefficients computed from the OCM data and the florescence intensity values were analyzed and showed a statistically significant difference for 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-positive and -negative brain tissues. OCM findings correlated well with malignant hot spots within brain tumor biopsies upon histopathology. The combination of OCM and FI seems to be a promising optical imaging modality providing complementary contrast for applications in the field of neuroimaging."

Such FFRs, in addition to a polymer filter material of varying effectiveness, also contain a layer of activated-carbon-loaded nonwoven filter, which limits the quantity of chemical compounds entering the breathing zone. The aim of this work was to analyse the influence of challenge concentration (20-120 ppm), relative humidity (2-70%), flow rate (20-55 L/min), and flow pattern (steady-state and pulsating) on the breakthrough of polymer/carbon nonwovens. A commercial activated-carbon-loaded nonwoven filter was used in this study. Its morphology and textural parameters were determined using optical microscopy, image processing, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements at 77 K. Breakthrough experiments were carried out using cyclohexane vapours to assess adsorption characteristics of polymer/carbon media. The results showed that the breakthrough times decreased with increasing challenge concentration (up to 30%), relative humidity (up to 73%), and flow rate (up to 72%). The pulsating flow pattern was found to be more favourable in terms of odour reduction efficiency (up to 30%). The results indicate that all of these factors should be considered during selection and performance assessment of respirators used for odour relief."

In the workflow of RCB assessment, estimation of cancer cellularity is a critical task, which is conventionally achieved by manually reviewing the hematoxylin and eosin- (H&E-) stained microscopic slides of cancer sections. In this work, we develop an automatic and direct method to estimate cellularity from histopathological image patches using deep feature representation, tree boosting, and support vector machine (SVM), avoiding the segmentation and classification of nuclei. Using a training set of 2394 patches and a test set of 185 patches, the estimations by our method show strong correlation to those by the human pathologists in terms of intraclass correlation (ICC) (0.94 with 95% CI of (0.93, 0.96)), Kendall's tau (0.83 with 95% CI of (0.79, 0.86)), and the prediction probability (0.93 with 95% CI of (0.91, 0.94)), compared to two other methods (ICC of 0.74 with 95% CI of (0.70, 0.77) and 0.83 with 95% CI of (0.79, 0.86)). Our method improves the accuracy and does not rely on annotations of individual nucleus."

Sublingual handheld vital microscopy has enabled online acquisition of moving image sequences of the microcirculation, including the flow of individual red blood cells in the capillary network. However, due to inherent content complexity, manual image sequence analysis remained gold standard, introducing inter-observer variability and precluding real-time image analysis for clinical therapy guidance. Here we introduce an advanced computer vision algorithm for instantaneous analysis and quantification of morphometric and kinetic information related to capillary blood flow in the sublingual microcirculation. We evaluated this technique in a porcine model of septic shock and resuscitation and cardiac surgery patients. This development is of high clinical relevance because it enables implementation of point-of-care goal-directed resuscitation procedures based on correction of microcirculatory perfusion in critically ill and perioperative patients."

Epub 2019 Apr 10.,Jenkins S,World Neurosurg,2019,2019/04/14,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.04.052,"OBJECTIVE: Fracture of the odontoid process is a critical injury to diagnose and often treat. The aim of this anatomic study was to present a comprehensive understanding of this part of the C2 vertebra. METHODS: We used 20 C2 vertebrae. Samples underwent imaging (computed tomography [CT] with and without three-dimensional reconstruction, micro-CT, 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging) and sagittal and coronal sectioning using a bone saw. Sectioned specimens were imaged under a digital handheld microscope, and transillumination of the bone was used to highlight its internal trabecular pattern. Three samples underwent infusion of the odontoid process with a hardening substance and were then decalcified. RESULTS: Internal trabecular patterns of the odontoid process of all specimens were discernible. In sagittal and coronal sections, trabecular patterns were highlighted with transillumination, but the patterns were much clearer using the digital microscope. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT provided the least detail of the imaging methods, but the trabecular patterns could be identified. Three-dimensional reconstruction of CT data was the preferred imaging method over magnetic resonance imaging and CT without three-dimensional reconstruction. The most distinct trabecular and cortical patterns were seen using micro-CT. Osteoporosis was seen in 2 specimens (10%). Five specimens (25%) were found to have a subdental synchondrosis. For most specimens, the trabeculae were found throughout the odontoid process. CONCLUSIONS: Improved knowledge of the anatomy, structural composition, and variations within the C2 vertebra may allow for better treatment options and patient care."

Epub 2019 Apr 13.,Taatjes DJ,Histochem Cell Biol,2019,2019/04/15,,,10.1007/s00418-019-01783-7,"Current best practice in the quantitative analysis of microscopy images dictates that image files should be saved in a lossless format such as TIFF. Use of lossy files, including those processed with the JPEG algorithm, is highly discouraged due to effects of compression on pixel characteristics. However, with the growing popularity of whole-slide imaging (WSI) and its attendant large file sizes, compressed image files are becoming more prevelent. This prompted us to perform a color-based quantitative pixel analysis of minimally compressed WSI images. Sections from three tissues stained with one of three reagents representing the colors blue (hematoxylin), red (Oil-Red-O), and brown (immunoperoxidase) were scanned with a whole slide imager in triplicate at 20x, 40x, and 63x magnifications. The resulting files were in the form of a BigTIFF with a JPEG compression automatically applied during acquisition. Images were imported into analysis software, six regions of interest were applied to various morphological locations, and the areas assessed for the color of interest. Whereas the number of designated weakly or strongly positive pixels was variable across the triplicate scans for the individual regions of interest, the total number of positive pixels was consistent. These results suggest that total positivity for a specific color representing a histochemical or immunohistochemical stain can be adequately quantitated on compressed images, but degrees of positivity (e.g., weak vs. strong) may not be as reliable. However, it is important to assess individual whole-slide imagers, file compression level and algorithm, and analysis software for reproducibility."

Epub 2019 May 3.,Castet F,J Neurooncol,2019,2019/05/05,,,10.1007/s11060-019-03183-2,"BACKGROUND: Contrast enhancement (CE) is found in 10-60% of low-grade gliomas. Its prognostic significance is controversial, and its correlation with IDH mutations and 1p/19q codeletion is elusive. The aim of this study is to investigate whether CE is associated with molecular characteristics of low-grade gliomas and uncover its prognostic value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All confirmed histological cases of low-grade gliomas diagnosed at our institution between years 2000-2016 were reviewed (n = 102). Spinal and brainstem localization, only-biopsied tumours with ring-like enhancement and incomplete medical records were excluded. RESULTS: Mean age was 42 years ( +/- 13.9 years), and 63.6% were male. The median follow-up time was 79.8 months. CE was present on 25% of preoperative MRI, and 25% of patients were considered high-risk according to Pignatti score. Most were astrocytomas (67%) and 87.2% were surgically removed. IDH mutation was found in 64.6% of tumour samples, and 18.8% had a 1p/19q codeletion. No subgroup differences were observed according to CE except for presurgical performance status and postoperative chemotherapy. IDH status and 1p/19q codeletion were evenly distributed. On univariate analysis, age, size > 6 cm, CE, extent of resection, Pignatti score, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion were significantly associated to OS. On multivariate analysis, only CE and IDH status were independently associated to OS. CE remained a significant prognostic factor in IDH-mutant non-codeleted tumours when analysed by tumour subtype. CONCLUSION: CE in low-grade gliomas provides prognostic information in IDH-mutant non-codeleted tumours, although its meaning remains uncertain in IDH-wildtype gliomas."

Currently, the gold standard for tissue characterization is assessment of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections by a pathologist. When processing tissue into H&E sections, the shape of the tissue deforms with respect to the initial shape when it was optically measured. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for these tissue deformations when correlating optical measurement with routinely acquired histopathology. We propose a method to register the tissue in the H&E sections to the optical measurements, which corrects for these tissue deformations. We compare the registered H&E sections to H&E sections that were registered with an algorithm that does not account for tissue deformations by evaluating both the shape and the composition of the tissue and using microcomputer tomography data as an independent measure. The proposed method, which did account for tissue deformations, was more accurate than the method that did not account for tissue deformations. These results emphasize the need for a registration method that accounts for tissue deformations, such as the method presented in this study, which can aid in validating optical techniques for clinical use."

There is an increasing demand in machine learning literature for such explainable models in health-related applications. This work aims to generate explanations on how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detects tumor tissue in patches extracted from histology whole slide images. This is achieved using the ""locally-interpretable model-agnostic explanations"" methodology. Two publicly-available convolutional neural networks trained on the Patch Camelyon Benchmark are analyzed. Three common segmentation algorithms are compared for superpixel generation, and a fourth simpler parameter-free segmentation algorithm is proposed. The main characteristics of the explanations are discussed, as well as the key patterns identified in true positive predictions. The results are compared to medical annotations and literature and suggest that the CNN predictions follow at least some aspects of human expert knowledge."

This work aimed to evaluate the biochemical characteristics of colon cancer and the clinical merits of multivariate Raman image and spectroscopy analysis. Tissue samples were collected during routine surgery. The non-fixed, fresh samples were used to prepare micrometer sections from the tumor mass and the tissue from the safety margins outside of the tumor mass. Adjacent sections were used for typical histological analysis. We have found that the chemical composition identified by Raman spectroscopy of the cancerous and the noncancerous colon samples is sufficiently different to distinguish pathologically changed tissue from noncancerous tissue. We present a detailed analysis of Raman spectra for the human noncancerous and cancerous colon tissue. The multivariate analysis of the intensities of lipids/proteins/carotenoids Raman peaks shows that these classes of compounds can statistically divide analyzed samples into noncancerous and pathological groups, reaffirming that Raman imaging is a powerful technique for the histochemical analysis of human tissues. Raman biomarkers based on ratios for lipids/proteins/carotenoids content were found to be the most useful biomarkers in spectroscopic diagnostics."

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of 49 patients with histopathologically confirmed GN who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced CT or MRI between 2010 and 2018. The independent samples t test and chi-square test were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to analyze the diagnostic sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP). Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. RESULTS The CT values were 32.59+/-3.61 Hounsfield units (HU) for plain scans, 38.87+/-5.09 HU for the arterial phase, and 54.26+/-8.14 HU for the venous phase, and the incidence of calcification and cysts was 32.6% and 10.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference in CT results and clinical parameters between mediastinal ganglioneuroma (MGN) and retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma (RGN) (p>0.05). The area under the curves (AUCs) for the arterial enhancement rate (AER), venous enhancement rate (VER), and AER/VER combined index in diagnosing GN were 0.735, 0.980, and 0.990, respectively. The VER of 0.2819 exhibited the SE and SP at 92.9% and 92.9%, respectively, to characterize the GN, whereas the AER of 0.1779 had SE and SP of 52.4% and 90.5%, respectively. The SE and SP for the combined index were 88.1% and 100%, respectively. The GN showed hypointensity on T1WI, hyperintense, or slightly high signal on T2WI with the linear hypointensity, and hyperintense on DWI. CONCLUSIONS A hypodense mass was observed for GN on plain scan and presented delayed enhancement on contrast enhancement. VER or AER/VER combination is more accurate than AER for the diagnosis of paravertebral GN."

Using this we extracted nuclear morphometric and chromatin texture based features and were able to discriminate between normal and cancer cells with similar accuracy as wide-field fluorescence microscopy. We were also able to detect subtle changes in nuclear and chromatin features in cells subjected to compressive forces, cytoskeletal perturbations and cytokine stimulation, thereby highlighting the sensitivity of the portable microscope. Taken together, we present a versatile platform to exploit nuclear morphometrics and chromatin condensation features as physical biomarkers for point-of-care diagnostic solutions."

In this regard, various yeast species are used as models in lipid metabolic research or for industrial lipid production. Lipid droplets are highly dynamic storage bodies and their cellular content represents a convenient readout of the lipid metabolic state. Fluorescence microscopy is a method of choice for quantitative analysis of cellular lipid droplets, as it relies on widely available equipment and allows analysis of individual lipid droplets. Furthermore, microscopic image analysis can be automated, greatly increasing overall analysis throughput. Here, we describe an experimental and analytical workflow for automated detection and quantitative description of individual lipid droplets in three different model yeast species: the fission yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lipid droplets are visualized with BODIPY 493/503, and cell-impermeable fluorescent dextran is added to the culture media to help identify cell boundaries. Cells are subjected to 3D epifluorescence microscopy in green and blue channels and the resulting z-stack images are processed automatically by a MATLAB pipeline. The procedure outputs rich quantitative data on cellular lipid droplet content and individual lipid droplet characteristics in a tabular format suitable for downstream analyses in major spreadsheet or statistical packages. We provide example analyses of lipid droplet content under various conditions that affect cellular lipid metabolism."

A total number of 160 breast lesions from 160 female patients were examined by STE. Resona 7 was equipped with ""shell"" function to measure elastic modulus values of tissue in the region of surrounding lesion quantitatively. The contours of the lesion were required to be delineated. The elastic modulus values of tissue in the region of 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm outside the boundary were acquired. The elastic modulus values included maximum elastic modulus (Emax), mean elastic modulus (Emean), minimum elastic modulus (Emin), and elastic modulus standard deviation (Esd). All lesions were confirmed by histopathology. We compared the differences of the above elastic modulus values between benign and malignant groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn with the histological diagnostic results as the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of STE. Operator consistency was also analyzed. Among the 160 lesions, 100 (62.5%) were benign and 60 (37.5%) were malignant. In the region of 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm surrounding the lesion, Emax, Emean, and Esd of malignant group were significantly higher than those of the benign group (all P<0.05). When the ""shell"" was 3mm, Emax had the highest AUROC value (AUROC = 0.998). Regarding the measurement of elastic modulus values, all the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values of the inter-operator consistency were greater than 0.75 for Emax, Emean, and Esd. Therefore, quantitative evaluation of tissue stiffness around lesion by STE has the potential to distinguish between benign and malignant breast lesions."

The present study aims to determine the robustness of such a technique, quantifying the expansion parameters i.e. scale factor, isotropy, uniformity. Our focus is on the nuclear pore complex (NPC), as well-known nanoscale component endowed of a preserved and symmetrical structure localized on the nuclear envelope. Here, we show that Nup153 is a good reporter to quantitatively address the isotropy of the expansion process. The quantitative analysis carried out on NPCs, at different spatial scales, allows concluding that expansion microscopy can be used at the nanoscale to measure subcellular features with an accuracy from 10 to 5 nm. Therefore, it is an excellent method for structural studies of macromolecular complexes."

A data-driven analytic approach based on structural MR images revealed the following findings: (1) The cortical surface can be subdivided into 13 independent regions (""communities"") based on macroscopic features. (2) Thirty centers of low inter-subject variability were found in major sulci on the cortical surface. Their variability showed a strong positive correlation with the known time points at which they appear in fetal development. Centers forming early induce a higher inter-subject regularity in a larger local vicinity, while those forming later result in smaller regions of higher variability. (3) The layout of sulcal and gyral patterns within a community is governed typically by two centers. Depending on the relative variability of each center, communities can be classified into structural sub-types. (4) Sub-types across ipsi-lateral communities are independent, but associated with the sub-type of the same community on the contra-lateral side. Results shown here integrate well with current knowledge about macroscopic, microscopic, and genetic determinants of brain development."

We aimed to define clinical and imaging features and determine prognostic factors for immunodeficiency-associated PCNSL. METHODS: All PCNSL cases seen at Yale-New Haven Hospital between 2002 and 2017 were retrospectively screened for immunodeficiency. For patients with immunosuppression, biopsies were evaluated and clinical data were collected. Predictors of survival were identified using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: 23 patients with immunodeficiencies were identified: eleven on immunosuppressants after solid organ transplantation, seven with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and five on immunosuppressive treatment due to various autoimmune disorders. PCNSL cases were largely Epstein-Barr-Virus positive (78%), histologically classified as diffuse large B cell lymphomas (87%), and showed peripheral contrast enhancement (81%) and corresponding heterogeneous diffusion-weighted imaging patterns (DWI) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (71%). Median overall survival was 31 months. Age > 60 years at diagnosis (p < 0.01), peripheral enhancement of the mass on MRI (p = 0.04), heterogeneous DWI patterns (p = 0.04), and clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement (IgHR) (p = 0.03) were found to be negative prognostic markers. CONCLUSIONS: Immunodeficiency-associated PCNSL presents with similar clinical, pathological and imaging features. Age > 60 years, clonal IgHR, heterogeneous DWI pattern and peripheral enhancement on MRI may serve as predictors of less favorable outcome."

Epub 2019 Jun 28.,Tosta TAA,Comput Biol Med,2019,2019/07/08,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.103344,"Histological samples stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) are commonly used by pathologists in cancer diagnoses. However, the preparation, digitization, and storage of tissue samples can lead to color variations that produce poor performance when using histological image processing techniques. Thus, normalization methods have been proposed to adjust the color of the image. This can be achieved through the use of a spectral matching technique, where it is first necessary to estimate the H&E representation and the stain concentration in the image pixels by means of the RGB model. This study presents an estimation method for H&E stain representation for the normalization of faded histological samples. This application has been explored only to a limited extent in the literature, but has the capacity to expand the use of faded samples. To achieve this, the normalized images must have a coherent color representation of the H&E stain with no introduction of noise, which was realized by applying the methodology described in this proposal. The estimation method presented here aims to normalize histological samples with different degrees of fading using a combination of fuzzy theory and the Cuckoo search algorithm, and dictionary learning with an initialization method for optimization. In visual and quantitative comparisons of estimates of H&E stain representation from the literature, our proposed method achieved very good results, with a high feature similarity between the original and normalized images."

Embryologists can monitor the entire embryo growth process and thus select the best embryos for fertilization. This time and the resource consuming process are among the key factors for success of pregnancies. Tools for automated evaluation of the embryo quality and development stage prediction are developed for improving embryo selection. METHODS: We present two-classifier vote-based method for embryo image classification. Our classification algorithms have been trained with features extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Prediction of embryo development stage is then completed by comparing confidence of two classifiers. Images are labeled depending on which one receives a larger confidence rating. RESULTS: The evaluation has been done with imagery of real embryos, taken in the ESCO Time Lapse incubator from four different developing embryos. The results illustrate the most effective combination of two classifiers leading to an increase of prediction accuracy and achievement of overall 97.62% accuracy for a test set classification. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented an approach for automated prediction of the embryo development stage for microscopy time-lapse incubator image. Our algorithm has extracted high-complexity image feature using CNN. Classification is done by comparing prediction of two classifiers and selecting the label of that classifier, which has a higher confidence value. This combination of two classifiers has allowed us to increase the overall accuracy of CNN from 96.58% by 1.04% up to 97.62%. The best results are achieved when combining the CNN and Discriminant classifiers. Practical implications include improvement of embryo selection process for in vitro fertilization."

AIM: The aim of our study, was to determine the stereological structural parameters of the parenchymal part of placenta, ratio of birth weight and placental weight, and to determine their correlation with the body length and head circumference of the newborns of adolescent pregnant women. METHODS: The study was conducted on a total of 60 human placentas of term pregnancy, divided into two groups according to the age of pregnant women. The experimental group consisted of 30 placenta of pregnant women aged 13-19. The control group consisted of 30 placenta of pregnant women aged 20-35. Computer assisted morphological analysis of images of histological preparations using stereological methods was performed. RESULTS: Surface density of terminal villi of adolescent placentas is significant higher than the control group (t = 14,179, df = 29, p <0,0001). The T-test (t = -5,868, df = 29, p <0,0001) showed statistically significant difference in the surface density of fibrinoid in two compared groups. T-test (t = 6.438, df = 29, p <0.0001) found that total surface of terminal villi was significantly higher in adolescent placentas. The T-test (t = -6,747, df = 29, p <0,0001) found that total surface of fibrinoid was significantly lower in adolescent group. The T-test (t = 4.203, df = 29, p <0.0001) found that the ratio of birth weight of newborn and adolescent placental weight was significantly higher in relation to the control group. CONCLUSION: Adolescent placentas was more efficient in increasing the weight of newborns, compared to the control group placentas."

For the visualization of the mitochondrial membrane dynamics in STED microscopy, rationally designed mitochondrial fluorescent markers with enhanced photostability are required. Herein, we report the development of a superphotostable fluorescent labeling reagent with long fluorescence lifetime, whose design is based on a structurally reinforced naphthophosphole fluorophore that is conjugated with an electron-donating diphenylamino group. The combination of long-lived fluorescence and superphotostable features of the fluorophore allowed us to selectively capture the ultrastructures of the mitochondrial cristae with a resolution of  approximately 60 nm when depleted at 660 nm. This chemical tool provides morphological information of the cristae, which has so far only been observed in fixed cells using electron microscopy. Moreover, this method gives information about the dynamic ultrastructures such as the intermembrane fusion in different mitochondria as well as the intercristae mergence in a single mitochondrion during the apoptosis-like mitochondrial swelling process."

Our proposed algorithm combines wavelet kernel SVM with color histogram to classify pathological image. Firstly, the pathological image is divided into non-overlapping sub-patches, and the features of sub-patch histogram are extracted. Then, the global and local features are fused by the sub-patch weighting algorithm. Then, the RelicfF based forward selection algorithm is used to integrate color features and texture features so as to enhance the characterization capabilities of the tumor cell. Finally, Morlet wavelet kernel-based least squares support vector machine method is adopted to enhance the generalization ability of the model for small sample with non-linear and high-dimensional pattern classification problems. Experimental results show that the proposed pathological diagnostic algorithm can gain higher accuracy compared with existing comparison algorithms."

However, pathological image analysis based on deep learning networks faces a number of challenges, such as the high resolution (gigapixel) of pathological images and the lack of annotation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a training strategy called deep-reverse active learning (DRAL) and atrous DenseNet (ADN) for pathological image classification. The proposed DRAL can improve the classification accuracy of widely used deep learning networks such as VGG-16 and ResNet by removing mislabeled patches in the training set. As the size of a cancer area varies widely in pathological images, the proposed ADN integrates the atrous convolutions with the dense block for multiscale feature extraction. RESULTS: The proposed DRAL and ADN are evaluated using the following three pathological datasets: BACH, CCG, and UCSB. The experiment results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed DRAL + ADN framework, achieving patch-level average classification accuracies (ACA) of 94.10%, 92.05% and 97.63% on the BACH, CCG, and UCSB validation sets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The DRAL + ADN framework is a potential candidate for boosting the performance of deep learning models for partially mislabeled training datasets."

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether different ADC metrics can also be used for prediction of receptor status, proliferation rate, and molecular subtype in invasive breast cancer. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: In all, 107 patients with invasive breast cancer met the inclusion criteria (mean age 57 years, range 32-87) and underwent multiparametric breast MRI. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 T, readout-segmented echo planar imaging (rsEPI) with IR fat suppression, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) T(1) -weighted imaging, T(2) -weighted turbo-spin echo (TSE) with fatsat. ASSESSMENT: Two readers independently drew a region of interest on ADC maps on the whole tumor (WTu), and on its darkest part (DpTu). Minimum, mean, and maximum ADC values of both WTu and DpTu were compared for receptor status, proliferation rate, and molecular subtypes. STATISTICAL TESTS: Wilcoxon rank sum, Mann-Whitney U-tests for associations between radiologic features and histopathology; histogram and q-q plots, Shapiro-Wilk's test to assess normality, concordance correlation coefficient for precision and accuracy; receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. RESULTS: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status had significantly different ADC values for both readers. Maximum WTu (P = 0.0004 and 0.0005) and mean WTu (P = 0.0101 and 0.0136) were significantly lower for ER-positive tumors, while PR-positive tumors had significantly lower maximum WTu values (P = 0.0089 and 0.0047). Maximum WTu ADC was the only metric that was significantly different for molecular subtypes for both readers (P = 0.0100 and 0.0132) and enabled differentiation of luminal tumors from nonluminal (P = 0.0068 and 0.0069) with an area under the curve of 0.685 for both readers.

One such technique is light-sheet microscopy, which enables rapid 3D imaging. Our pathology-engineering collaboration has resulted in an open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscope that is specifically tailored to the needs of pathology practice. OBJECTIVE.-: To present an image atlas of OTLS images of prostate core needle biopsies. DESIGN.-: Core needle biopsies (N = 9) were obtained from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens. Each biopsy was fixed in formalin, dehydrated in ethanol, stained with TO-PRO3 and eosin, optically cleared, and imaged using OTLS microscopy. The biopsies were then processed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 5 and cytokeratin 8 was performed. RESULTS.-: Benign and neoplastic histologic structures showed high fidelity between OTLS and traditional light microscopy. OTLS microscopy had no discernible effect on hematoxylin-eosin or immunohistochemical staining in this pilot study. The 3D histology information obtained using OTLS microscopy enabled new structural insights, including the observation of cribriform and well-formed gland morphologies within the same contiguous glandular structures, as well as the continuity of poorly formed glands with well-formed glands. CONCLUSIONS.-: Three-dimensional OTLS microscopy images have a similar appearance to traditional hematoxylin-eosin histology images, with the added benefit of useful 3D structural information. Further studies are needed to continue to document the OTLS appearance of a wide range of tissues and to better understand 3D histologic structures."

We propose an automated system for skin lesion detection and classification based on statistical normal distribution and optimal feature selection. Local contrast is controlled using a brighter channel enhancement technique, and segmentation is performed through a statistical normal distribution approach. The multiplication law of probability is implemented for the fusion of segmented images. In the feature extraction phase, optimized histogram, optimized color, and gray level co-occurrences matrices features are extracted and covariance-based fusion is performed. Subsequently, optimal features are selected through a binary grasshopper optimization algorithm. The selected optimal features are finally fed to a classifier and evaluated on the ISBI 2016 and ISBI 2017 data sets. Classification accuracy is computed using different Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernel functions, and the best accuracy is obtained for the cubic function. The average accuracies of the proposed segmentation on the PH2 and ISBI 2016 data sets are 93.79 and 96.04%, respectively, for an image size 512 x 512. The accuracies of the proposed classification on the ISBI 2016 and ISBI 2017 data sets are 93.80 and 93.70%, respectively. The proposed system outperforms existing methods on selected data sets."

Utilizing object recognition procedures and holographic autofocusing during the numerical reconstruction of the acquired off-axis holograms, sharply focused quantitative phase images of suspended cells in flow were retrieved without labeling, from which biophysical cellular features of distinct cells, such as cell radius, refractive index and dry mass, can be subsequently retrieved in an automated manner. The performance of the proposed concept was first characterized by investigations on microspheres that were utilized as test standards. Then, we analyzed two types of pancreatic tumor cells with different morphology to further verify the applicability of the proposed method for quantitative live cell imaging. The retrieved biophysical datasets from cells in flow are found in good agreement with results from comparative investigations with previously developed DHM methods under static conditions, which demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of our approach.

RoIs were coregistered with sd-SFDI data and sampled into  approximately 4  x  4  mm2 subimage samples of confirmed and homogeneous histological categories. Sd-SFDI reflectance textures were analyzed using gray-level co-occurrence matrix pixel statistics, image primitives, and power spectral density curve parameters. Texture metrics exhibited statistical significance (p-value  <  0.05) between three benign and three malignant tissue subtypes. Pairs of benign and malignant subtypes underwent texture-based, binary classification with correlation-based feature selection. Classification performance was evaluated using fivefold cross-validation and feature grid searching. Classification using subdiffuse, monochromatic reflectance (illumination spatial frequency of fx  =  1.37  mm  -  1, optical wavelength of lambda  =  490  nm) achieved accuracies ranging from 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69) to 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.00) depending on the benign-malignant diagnosis pair.

Here we show that during induction of DNA damage-induced senescence in human non-cancerous cells, PML accumulates at the nucleolar periphery simultaneously with inactivation of RNA polymerase I (RNAP I) and nucleolar segregation. Using time-lapse and high-resolution microscopy, we followed the genesis, structural transitions and destiny of PNAs to show that: 1) the dynamic structural changes of the PML-nucleolar interaction are tightly associated with inactivation and reactivation of RNAP I-mediated transcription, respectively; 2) the PML-nucleolar compartment develops sequentially under stress and, upon stress termination, it culminates in either of two fates: disappearance or persistence; 3) all PNAs stages can associate with DNA damage markers; 4) the persistent, commonly long-lasting PML multi-protein nucleolar structures (PML-NDS) associate with markers of DNA damage, indicating a role of PNAs in persistent DNA damage response characteristic for senescent cells. Given the emerging evidence implicating PML in homologous recombination-directed DNA repair, we propose that PNAs contribute to sequestration and faithful repair of the highly unstable ribosomal DNA repeats, a fundamental process to maintain a precise balance between DNA repair mechanisms, with implications for genomic integrity and aging."

Due to their unique perfusion of the nerve fibre layer the RPCs are particularly significant for optic-neuropathies. The inputs to the analysis were z-stacks from 3D confocal fluorescence microscopy from 62 human retinas aged 9 to 84 years. Our aim was to find morphometric correlates of age. The retinas had no ophthalmic history. The analysis was undertaken in two stages: (1) converting the z-stacks to 3D tubular networks of vessels, and (2) characterizing the tubular networks using features derived from the Minkowski functionals (MFs). The MFs measure: the capillary volume, surface area, mean breadth, and Euler number. The mean breadth is related to tortuosity, wall shear stress and resistance to flow, and the Euler number is related to the density of loops (collaterals). Features derived from the surface area, mean breadth and Euler number were most related to age (all p </= 0.006). The results indicate the importance of pressure-equalizing loops and tortuosity as quantitative measures related to perfusion efficiency. The novel morphometric analysis could quantify disease-related accelerated aging and vessel malformation."

This requires methods that are able to cope with variability without requiring to annotate a large amount of samples for each characteristic. In this paper, we develop approaches based on adversarial models for image-to-image translation relying on unpaired training. Specifically, we propose approaches for stain-independent supervised segmentation relying on image-to-image translation for obtaining an intermediate representation. Furthermore, we develop a fully-unsupervised segmentation approach exploiting image-to-image translation to convert from the image to the label domain. Finally, both approaches are combined to obtain optimum performance in unsupervised segmentation independent of the characteristics of the underlying stain. Experiments on patches showing kidney histology proof that stain-translation can be performed highly effectively and can be used for domain adaptation to obtain independence of the underlying stain. It is even capable of facilitating the underlying segmentation task, thereby boosting the accuracy if an appropriate intermediate stain is selected. Combining domain adaptation with unsupervised segmentation finally showed the most significant improvements."

In contrast to local optical flow models employed in the existing non-rigid registration methods, we introduce approaches based on a global optical flow model. Our registration model consists of a data fidelity term and a regularization term. We compared different regularizers for the deformation fields and found that a convex quadratic function is more suitable than non-convex ones. To improve the robustness, we propose an adaptive weighting scheme based on the statistics of the noise in fluorescence microscopy images as well as a combined local-global scheme. Moreover, we extend the global method by exploiting high-order image features. The best suitable high-order features are determined through learning two generative image models, namely, fields of experts and convolutional Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine, whose model formulations are both consistent with the assumption of high-order feature constancy in the registration model. Using multiple data sets of real 2D and 3D live cell microscopy image sequences as well as synthetic image data, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous methods in terms of both registration accuracy and computational efficiency."

METHODS: Diffusion-weighted imaging data were postprocessed using monoexponential, lVIM and DK models to quantitate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), molecular diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (Dstar), perfusion fraction (F), apparent diffusion for Gaussian distribution (Dapp), and apparent kurtosis coefficient (Kapp). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationship between those parameters and the GS, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney U test were performed to compare the above parameters between the different groups, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the differential diagnosis ability. The interpretation of the results is in view of histopathologic tumor tissue composition. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of ADC, F, D, Dapp, and Kapp in differentiating GS </= 3 + 4 and GS > 3 + 4 PCa were 0.744 (95% CI 0.581-0.868), 0.726 (95% CI 0.563-0.855), 0.732 (95% CI 0.569-0.860), and 0.752 (95% CI 0.590-0.875), 0.766 (95% CI 0.606-0.885), respectively, and those in differentiating GS </= 7 and GS > 7 PCa were 0.755 (95% CI 0.594-0.877), 0.734 (95% CI 0.571-0.861), 0.724 (95% CI0.560-0.853), and 0.716 (95% CI 0.552-0.847), 0.828 (95% CI 0.676-0.929), respectively. All the P values were less than 0.05. There was no significant difference in the AUC for the detection of different GS groups by using those parameters. CONCLUSION: Both the IVIM and DKI models are beneficial to predict GS of PCa and indirectly predict its aggressiveness, and they have a comparable diagnostic performance with each other as well as ADC."

However tubular structures such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) networks and complex dynamics such as the fusion and fission of mitochondria, due to their low phase contrast, still need fluorescent labeling to be adequately imaged. In this article, we report a quantitative phase microscope with ultra-oblique illumination that enables us to see those structures and their dynamics with high contrast for the first time without labeling. The imaging capability was validated through comparison to the fluorescence images with the same field-of-view. The high image resolution (~270 nm) was validated using both beads and cellular structures. Furthermore, we were able to record the vibration of ER networks at a frame rate of 250 Hz. We additionally show complex cellular processes such as remodeling of the mitochondria networks through fusion and fission and vesicle transportation along the ER without labels. Our high spatial and temporal resolution allowed us to observe mitochondria ""spinning"", which has not been reported before, further demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method."

Epub 2019 Jul 6.,Helal MH,Clin Radiol,2019,2019/07/10,,,10.1016/j.crad.2019.06.002,"AIM: To assess the utility of contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) to detect malignancy in the postoperative breast of cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a prospective analysis of 76 women following operations for breast cancer. CESM was performed with low (22-33 kVp) and high (44-49 kVp) energy exposures after intravenous injection of contrast agent. Breast abnormalities were evaluated regarding the presence, morphology, and pattern of contrast medium uptake. The reference standard was histopathology of the Tru-Cut biopsy or surgical biopsy in cases where malignancy was suspected and absence of abnormality at follow-up sessions in benign cases. RESULTS: Seventy cases were eligible for data analysis, and malignancy was detected in 48.6% (n=34/70). Enhancement at the operative bed was observed in 40 (57.14%) lesions. At traditional mammography, the diagnosis was false negative in 17/70 and false positive in 28/70 lesions, and presented a low sensitivity of 50%, a very low specificity of 22%, a positive predictive value of 37.7%, a negative predicative value of 32%, and an accuracy of 35.7%. CESM enhanced the performance of mammography and produced a sensitivity of 91.17%, a specificity of 75%, a positive predictive value of 77.5%, a negative predictive value of 90%, and an accuracy of 82.85%. CONCLUSION: CESM is a credible technique that could be used in conjunction with the traditional mammogram to screen for cancer in the postoperative breast."

Epub 2019 Jul 22.,Burr DB,Bone,2019,2019/07/26,,,10.1016/j.bone.2019.07.015,"The microarchitecture of bone tissue presents many features that could act as stress concentrators for the initiation of bone microdamage. This was first identified by John Currey in a seminal paper in 1962 in which he presented the mechanical and biological evidence for stress concentrations at the bone surface, within the bone through the action of stiffness differentials between architectural features including between lamellae, and at the level of the lacunar and canalicular walls. Those early observations set the stage to consider how microscopic damage to bone tissue might affect the properties of bone at a time when most in the scientific community dismissed microcracks in bone as artifact. Evidence collected in the nearly 60 years since those important initial observations suggest that some of these architectural features in bone tissue are more effective as crack arrestors than as crack initiators. Sites of higher mineralization in the bone matrix, particularly interstitial sites in both cortical and trabecular bone, may serve preferentially as locations for crack initiation, whereas those boundaries identified by Currey as both stress concentrators and stress arrestors are more effective at stopping cracks than at initiating them."

Epub 2019 Aug 13.,Yoon JS,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2019,2019/08/23,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105028,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mapping the architecture of the brain is essential for identifying the neural computations that affect behavior. Traditionally in histology, stained objects in tissue slices are hand-marked under a microscope in a manually intensive, time-consuming process. An integrated hardware and software system is needed to automate image acquisition, image processing, and object detection. Such a system would enable high throughput tissue analysis to rapidly map an entire brain. METHODS: We demonstrate an automated system to detect neurons using a monkey brain slice immunohistochemically stained for retrogradely labeled neurons. The proposed system obtains a reconstructed image of the sample, and stained neurons are detected in three steps. First, the reconstructed image is pre-processed using adaptive histogram equalization. Second, candidates for stained neurons are segmented from each region via marker-controlled watershed transformation (MCWT) using maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs). Third, the candidates are categorized as neurons or non-neurons using deep transfer learning via pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN). RESULTS: The proposed MCWT algorithm was compared qualitatively against MorphLibJ and an IHC analysis tool, while our unified classification algorithm was evaluated quantitatively using ROC analyses. The proposed classification system was first compared with five previously developed layers (AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and ResNet). A comparison with conventional multi-stage frameworks followed using six off-the-shelf classifiers [Bayesian network (BN), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT), bagging (BAG), AdaBoost (ADA), and logistic regression (LR)] and two descriptors (LBP and HOG). The system achieved a 0.918 F1-score with an 86.6% negative prediction value. Remarkably, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F-scores surpassed the 90% threshold compared to traditional methods. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a fully automated, integrated hardware and software system for rapidly acquiring focused images and identifying neurons from a stained brain slice. This system could be adapted for the identification of stained features of any biological tissue."

Epub 2019 Aug 30.,Salsabili S,Comput Biol Med,2019,2019/09/13,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.103420,"PURPOSE: Manual analysis of clinical placenta pathology samples under the microscope is a costly and time-consuming task. Computer-aided diagnosis might offer a means to obtain fast and reliable results and also substantially reduce inter- and intra-rater variability. Here, we present a fully automated segmentation method that is capable of distinguishing the complex histological features of the human placenta (i.e., the chorionic villous structures). METHODS: The proposed pipeline consists of multiple steps to segment individual placental villi structures in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained placental images. Artifacts and undesired objects in the histological field of view are detected and excluded from further analysis. One of the challenges in our new algorithm is the detection and segmentation of touching villi in our dataset. The proposed algorithm uses the top-hat transformation to detect candidate concavities in each structure, which might represent two distinct villous structures in close proximity. The detected concavities are classified by extracting multiple features from each candidate concavity. Our proposed pipeline is evaluated against manual segmentations, confirmed by an expert pathologist, on 12 scans from three healthy control patients and nine patients diagnosed with preeclampsia, containing nearly 5000 individual villi. The results of our method are compared to a previously published method for villi segmentation. RESULTS: Our algorithm detected placental villous structures with an F1 score of 80.76% and sensitivity of 82.18%. These values are substantially better than the previously published method, whose F1 score and sensitivity are 65.30% and 55.12%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our method is capable of distinguishing the complex histological features of the human placenta (i.e., the chorionic villous structures), removing artifacts over a large histopathology sample of human placenta, and (importantly) account for touching adjacent villi structures. Compared to existing methods, our developed method yielded high accuracy in detecting villi in placental images."

This study evaluated micro-nano-textural features of oral epithelium from scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images and the sub-epithelial connective tissue from light microscopic (LM) and atomic force microscopic (AFM) images for normal and OPMD (namely oral sub-mucous fibrosis, i.e., OSF). Objective textural descriptors, namely discrete wavelet transform, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and local binary pattern (LBP), were extracted and fed to standard classifiers. Best classification accuracy of 87.28 and 93.21%; sensitivity of 93 and 96%; specificity of 80 and 91% were achieved, respectively, for SEM and AFM. In the study groups, SEM analysis showed a significant (p < 0.01) variation for all the considered textural descriptors, while for AFM, a remarkable alteration (p < 0.01) was only found in GLCM and LBP. Interestingly, sub-epithelial collagen nanoscale and microscale textural information from AFM and LM images, respectively, were complementary, namely microlevel contrast was more in normal (0.251) than OSF (0.193), while nanolevel contrast was more in OSF (0.283) than normal (0.204). This work, thus, illustrated differential micro-nano-textural attributes for oral epithelium and sub-epithelium to distinguish OPMD precisely and may be contributory in early cancer diagnostics."

The present study examines the applicability of three existing histological age-at-death estimation methods as applied to an Australian population of known age and sex. Microradiographs from 50 mid-shaft femora thin sections, equally divided by sex, were obtained from the Melbourne Femur Reference Collection (MFRC); stated chronological age-at-death is 18 to 88 years. Osteon shape metrics are measured using ImageJ and the age-at-death prediction formulae of i) Singh and Gunberg, ii) Keough et al., and iii) Goliath et al. are applied. The relationship between estimated and actual age-at-death is then statistically quantified. All three formulae demonstrate pooled and sex-specific SEE values in excess of 20 years: i) pooled +/-22.92 (male symbol+/-20.91, female symbol+/-25.20); ii) +/-20.79 (male symbol+/-20.96, female symbol+/-21.05); and iii) +/-35.43 (male symbol+/-32.68, female symbol+/-38.66). When individuals under 40 years of age were excluded from the analysis, only two of the methods demonstrated increased accuracy: i) pooled +/-20.87 (male symbol +/-17.47, female symbol +/-23.70); ii) pooled +/-18.21 (male symbol+/-16.51, female symbol+/-19.90); and iii) pooled +/-41.18 (male symbol +/-40.12, female symbol 43.05). The present study represents a preliminary investigation of the accuracy of existing histological age-at-death standards applied in an Australian population of known age."

However, the underlying microstructural mechanisms are unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), quantitative MRI (qMRI), and diffusion MRI (dMRI) in children and adults, we tested what quantitative changes occur to gray and white matter in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) from childhood to adulthood, and how these changes relate to cortical thinning. T(1) relaxation time from qMRI and mean diffusivity (MD) from dMRI provide independent and complementary measurements of microstructural properties of gray and white matter tissue. In face- and character-selective regions in lateral VTC, T(1) and MD decreased from age 5 to adulthood in mid and deep cortex, as well as in their adjacent white matter. T(1) reduction also occurred longitudinally in children's brain regions. T(1) and MD decreases 1) were consistent with tissue growth related to myelination, which we verified with adult histological myelin stains, and 2) were correlated with apparent cortical thinning. In contrast, in place-selective cortex in medial VTC, we found no development of T(1) or MD after age 5, and thickness was related to cortical morphology. These findings suggest that lateral VTC likely becomes more myelinated from childhood to adulthood, affecting the contrast of MR images and, in turn, the apparent gray-white boundary. These findings are important because they suggest that VTC does not thin during childhood but instead gets more myelinated. Our data have broad ramifications for understanding both typical and atypical brain development using advanced in vivo quantitative measurements and clinical conditions implicating myelin."

In thick unlabeled specimens, multiple scattering randomizes the phase of the field and absorption attenuates light that travels long optical paths. These obstacles limit the performance of transmission imaging. To mitigate these challenges, we developed an epi-illumination gradient light interference microscope (epi-GLIM) as a label-free phase imaging modality applicable to bulk or opaque samples. Epi-GLIM enables studying turbid structures that are hundreds of microns thick and otherwise opaque to transmitted light. We demonstrate this approach with a variety of man-made and biological samples that are incompatible with imaging in a transmission geometry: semiconductors wafers, specimens on opaque and birefringent substrates, cells in microplates, and bulk tissues. We demonstrate that the epi-GLIM data can be used to solve the inverse scattering problem and reconstruct the tomography of single cells and model organisms."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical material comprised biopsy specimens of 67 patients with a diagnosis of CRC. Two experienced pathologists used H&E-stained material for grading CRC lesions and immunohistochemical (IHC) stain for AIB1 expression. Twenty six patients were diagnosed with grade I, 28 with grade II, and 13 with grade III CRC. Guided by pathologists, we selected the regions of interest from AIB1-digitized images of each patient, encompassing the epithelial gland, and we computed 69 features, quantifying textural and color properties of the AIB1-stained lesions. We evaluated the statistical differences between grades by means of the Wilcoxon statistical test for each feature, and we assessed changes in feature values with advancing tumor grade by means of the Point Biserial Correlation. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed 14 single features, quantifying textural and color properties of the epithelial gland, which sustained statistically significant differences between LG-CRC and HG-CRC cases. These features were drawn from the gray-level image histogram, the cooccurrence matrix, the run length matrix, the discrete wavelet transform, the Tamura method, and the L*a*b color transform. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic statistical analysis of AIB1-stained biopsy material showed that high-grade CRC lesions contain higher intensity levels, appear coarser, are more homogeneous with smooth variation across the image, have lower contrast that is slowly varying across the image, have lower AIB1 staining, and have lower edges. A combination of textural and color attributes, evaluating image gray-tone distribution, textural roughness, inhomogeneity, AIB1 staining, and image coarseness should be considered in evaluating AIB1-stained CRC lesions."

METHODS: We create shape models for ten pairs of cranial nerves. High-resolution T(2) MR images are segmented for nerve centerline using a 1-Simplex discrete deformable 3D contour model. These segmented centerlines comprise training datasets for the shape model. Point correspondence for the training dataset is performed using an entropy-based energy minimization framework applied to particles located on the centerline curve. The shape information is incorporated into the 1-Simplex model by introducing a shape-based internal force, making the deformation stable against low resolution and image artifacts. RESULTS: The proposed method is validated through extensive experiments using both synthetic and patient MRI data. The robustness and stability of the proposed method are experimented using synthetic datasets. SSMs are constructed independently for ten pairs (CNIII-CNXII) of brainstem cranial nerves using ten non-pathological image datasets of the brainstem. The constructed ten SSMs are assessed in terms of compactness, specificity and generality. In order to quantify the error distances between segmented results and ground truths, two metrics are used: mean absolute shape distance (MASD) and Hausdorff distance (HD). MASD error using the proposed shape model is 0.19 +/- 0.13 (mean +/- std. deviation) mm and HD is 0.21 mm which are sub-voxel accuracy given the input image resolution. CONCLUSION: This paper described a probabilistic digital atlas of the ten brainstem-attached cranial nerve pairs by incorporating a statistical shape model with the 1-Simplex deformable contour. The integration of shape information as a priori knowledge results in robust and accurate centerline segmentations from even low-resolution MRI data, which is essential in neurosurgical planning and simulations for accurate and robust 3D patient-specific models of critical tissues including cranial nerves."

Six features are extracted from histograms of scattering maps. All features are able to statistically distinguish benign from malignant ovaries. Two prediction models were constructed based on these features: a logistic regression model (LR) and a support vector machine (SVM). The optimal set of features is mean scattering coefficient and scattering map entropy. The LR achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 97.0% and 97.8%, and SVM demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 99.6% and 96.4%.

Epub 2019 Jul 19.,Goertz L,World Neurosurg,2019,2019/07/23,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.07.113,"OBJECTIVE: Indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography (VAG) is an established method for assessment of cerebral blood flow during microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms. FLOW 800 is a surgical microscope-integrated software program that shows the cerebral blood flow in color-coded maps, thus providing semi-quantitative and real-time analysis of ICG data. We aimed to establish reference values for FLOW 800 parameters before and after microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms and to evaluate the potential of FLOW 800 to guide intraoperative decisions. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 54 patients (mean age, 53.6 +/- 11.6 years) who underwent microsurgical clipping for 60 aneurysms and intraoperative evaluation of ICG fluorescence dynamics using FLOW 800 color-coded maps. FLOW 800 data were correlated with patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, and intraoperative decision making. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in FLOW 800 data between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms (P > 0.05). Likewise, the hemodynamic parameters were not significantly different before and after definite clip placement (P > 0.05). However, in 2 cases, analysis of transit times by FLOW 800 analysis showed a hemodynamically significant clip stenosis that might have been missed by conventional ICG-VAG and resulted in adjustment of the clip position. Overall, there was 1 cerebral infarction, which was not related to clip placement. CONCLUSIONS: FLOW 800 is a useful adjunct to ICG-VAG for intraoperative assessment of cerebral perfusion and may help to identify hemodynamically relevant clip stenosis. The beneficial impact of FLOW 800 on clinical outcome after microsurgical clipping needs to be confirmed by comparative studies."

We studied the characteristics of the anatomical border of gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted imaging (WI) and hypointensity on T2WI to employ a simple technique of histogram-profile analysis of MRI for differentiation of various ring-enhancing intracranial lesions. METHODS: After approval from the institutional review board, preoperative MRI (T2WI, postcontrast T1WI) scans were analyzed retrospectively in 18 patients with histologically confirmed brain abscess, 66 glioblastomas, 46 brain-metastases, and 16 tumefactive multiple sclerosis (MS). T2WI and postcontrast T1WI were overlapped, and histogram-profile analysis was performed with in-house image-fusion software. The pattern of differential-peaks in histogram-profile was assessed visually. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis incorporating histogram-profile patterns was performed in patients with glioblastoma. RESULTS: The histogram-profile study revealed 4 distinct patterns. Pattern 1 showed no differential T2-hypointensity trough, pattern 2 had T2-hypointensity trough inside, whereas pattern 3 had T2-hypointensity trough overlapping the enhanced margin. Pattern 4 had T2-hypointensity trough immediately external to the enhanced margin. Pattern 1 was specific for tumefactive MS (93.3%), whereas pattern 4 was specific for glioblastoma (40.7%). Pattern 4 glioblastoma was subdivided into rim (T2-hypointensity >/=50% of circumference of contrast-enhanced tumor) and arc (T2-hypointensity <50% of circumference of contrast-enhanced tumor). Pattern 4 glioblastoma was further subdivided into group A (edema: T2-hyperintensity >/=50% of circumference of contrast-enhanced tumor) and group B (less edema: T2-hyperintensity <50% of circumference of contrast-enhanced tumor). Patients with pattern 3 glioblastoma (37.6%) had better survival compared with others (P = 0.0341) and pattern 4B had decreased survival compared with pattern 4A (P = 0.0001) and others (P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Tumefactive MS and a subset of glioblastomas show specific patterns in histogram-profile analysis. The difference in anatomical border also determines difference in survival in glioblastoma. Histogram-profile analysis is a simple and efficient technique to differentiate these pathologies."

Here, the nano-resolved population dynamics of QDs is exploited to reconstruct the topography and structural changes of the cell membrane surface with high temporal and spatial resolution. For this proof-of-concept study, bright, small, and stable biofunctional QD nanoconstructs are utilized recognizing the endogenous neuronal cannabinoid receptor 1, a highly expressed and fast-diffusing membrane protein, together with a commercial point-localization microscope. Rapid QD diffusion on the axonal plasma membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons allows precise reconstruction of the membrane surface in less than 1 min with a spatial resolution of tens of nanometers. Access of the QD nanoconstructs to the synaptic cleft enables rapid 3D topological reconstruction of the entire presynaptic component. Successful reconstruction of membrane nano-topology and deformation at the second time-scale is also demonstrated for HEK293 cell filopodia and axons. Named ""nanoPaint,"" this super-resolution imaging technique amenable to any endogenous transmembrane target represents a versatile platform to rapidly and accurately reconstruct the cell membrane nano-topography, thereby enabling the study of the rapid dynamic phenomena involved in neuronal membrane plasticity."

Epub 2019 Oct 29.,Lucas M,J Endourol,2019,2019/10/29,,,10.1089/end.2019.0354,"Purpose: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is the most common urinary cancer. White-light cystoscopy (WLC) forms the corner stone for the diagnosis of UCB. However, histopathological assessment is required for adjuvant treatment selection. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) enables visualization of the microarchitecture of bladder lesions during WLC, which allows for real-time tissue differentiation and grading of UCB. To improve the diagnostic process of UCB, computer-aided classification of pCLE videos of in vivo bladder lesions were evaluated in this study. Materials and Methods: We implemented preprocessing methods to optimize contrast and to reduce striping artifacts in each individual pCLE frame. Subsequently, a semiautomatic frame selection was performed. The selected frames were used to train a feature extractor based on pretrained ImageNet networks. A recurrent neural network, in specific long short-term memory (LSTM), was used to predict the grade of bladder lesions. Differentiation of lesions was performed at two levels, namely (i) healthy and benign vs malignant tissue and (ii) low-grade vs high-grade papillary UCB. A total of 53 patients with 72 lesions were included in this study, resulting in  approximately 140,000 pCLE frames. Results: The semiautomated frame selection reduced the number of frames to  approximately 66,500 informative frames. The accuracy for differentiation of (i) healthy and benign vs malignant urothelium was 79% and (ii) high-grade and low-grade papillary UCB was 82%. Conclusions: A feature extractor in combination with LSTM results in proper stratification of pCLE videos of in vivo bladder lesions."

Multi-parametric MRI offers a significant amount of data relevant for characterization of human cerebral thrombi. Patients and methods Cerebral thrombi of 17 patients diagnosed with acute stroke were acquired by mechanical thrombectomy. The thrombi were subsequently scanned using a high spatial-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI to obtain morphological characteristics of the thrombi and also by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and transversal nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation time (T2) mapping. The MRI results were analysed for possible correlations between thrombectomy procedure parameters (recanalization time and number of passes) and MR-measurable parameters (sample-mean ADC and T2, within-sample coefficient of variation of ADC and T2, and thrombus length). Results Both MRI mapping techniques enabled a good discrimination among thrombi regions of different water mobility and compaction. Within-sample coefficient of variation of ADC was found most sensitive for discrimination between the thrombi where thrombectomy procedure was performed in a single pass and those where is was performed in two or more passes (p = 0.03). Interestingly, negative correlation was found between the recanalization time and thrombus length (rho = -0.22). Conclusions Preliminary results of presented study shows that pretreatment MRI assessment of thrombi in stroke patients could potentially ease stroke treatment planning. In this study it is shown that within-sample coefficient of variation of ADC could serve for prediction of possible complications during thrombectomy procedures."

Previously, only small studies investigated clinical and imaging features of MS. The purpose of this study was to elucidate clinical and imaging features of MS based upon a multicenter patient sample. METHODS: Patient records of radiological databases of 4 German university hospitals were retrospectively screened for MS in the time period 01/2001 and 06/2019. Overall, 151 cases/76 females (50.3%) with a mean age of 55.5 +/- 15.1 years and 183 histopathological confirmation or clinically suspicious lesions of MS were included into this study. The underlying hematological disease, localizations, and clinical symptoms as well as imaging features on CT and MRI were investigated. RESULTS: In 15 patients (9.9% of all 151 cases) the manifestation of MS preceded the systemic hematological disease. In 43 cases (28.4%), first presentation of MS occurred simultaneously with the initial diagnosis of leukemia, and 92 (60.9%) patients presented MS after the initial diagnosis. In 37 patients (24.5%), the diagnosis was made incidentally by imaging. Clinically, cutaneous lesions were detected in 35 of 151 cases (23.2%). Other leading symptoms were pain (n = 28/151, 18.5%), neurological deficit (n = 27/151, 17.9%), swelling (n = 14/151, 9.3%) and dysfunction of the affected organ (n = 10/151, 6.0%). Most commonly, skin was affected (n = 30/151, 16.6%), followed by bone (n = 29/151, 16.0%) and lymphatic tissue (n = 21/151, 11.4%). Other localizations were rare. On CT, most lesions were homogenous. On T2-weighted imaging, most of the lesions were hyperintense. On T1-weighted images, MS was hypointense in n = 22/54 (40.7%) and isointense in n = 30/54 (55.6%). A diffusion restriction was identified in most cases with a mean ADC value of 0.76 +/- 0.19 x 10(- 3) mm(2)/s. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows clinical and imaging features of MS based upon a large patient sample in a multicenter design. MS occurs in most cases meta-chronous to the hematological disease and most commonly affects the cutis. One fourth of cases were identified incidentally on imaging, which needs awareness of the radiologists for possible diagnosis of MS."

We performed phagocytosis assays confronting various strains of Lichtheimia species with alveolar macrophages, which form the first line of defence of the innate immune system. To investigate 17 strains from four different continents in a comparative fashion, transmitted light and confocal fluorescence microscopy was applied in combination with automated image analysis. This interdisciplinary approach enabled the objective and quantitative processing of the big volume of image data. Applying machine-learning supported methods, a spontaneous clustering of the strains was revealed in the space of phagocytic measures. This clustering was not driven by measures of fungal morphology but rather by the geographical origin of the fungal strains. Our study illustrates the crucial contribution of machine-learning supported automated image analysis to the qualitative discovery and quantitative comparison of major factors affecting host-pathogen interactions. We found that the phagocytic vulnerability of Lichtheimia species depends on their geographical origin, where strains within each geographic region behaved similarly, but strongly differed amongst the regions. Based on this clustering, we were able to also classify clinical isolates with regard to their potential geographical origin."

Pathologically, they feature smoldering inflammatory demyelination at the edge, remyelination failure, and axonal degeneration. To our knowledge, the prospect of long-term in vivo monitoring makes it possible for the first time to determine their contribution to disability and value as a treatment target. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether rim lesions are associated with patient disability and long-term lesion outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We performed 3 studies at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center: (1) a prospective clinical/radiological cohort of 209 patients with MS (diagnosis according to the 2010 McDonald revised MS criteria, age >/=18 years, with 7-T or 3-T susceptibility-based brain MRI results) who were enrolled from January 2012 to March 2018 (of 209, 17 patients [8%] were excluded because of uninterpretable MRI scans); (2) a radiological/pathological analysis of expanding lesions featuring rims; and (3) a retrospective longitudinal radiological study assessing long-term lesion evolution in 23 patients with MS with yearly MRI scans for 10 years or more (earliest scan, 1992). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: (1) Identification of chronic rim lesions on 7-T or 3-T susceptibility-based brain MRI in 192 patients with MS and the association of rim counts with clinical disability (primary analysis) and brain volume changes (exploratory analysis). (2) Pathological characterization of 10 expanding lesions from an adult with progressive MS who came to autopsy after 7 years of receiving serial in vivo MRI scans. (3) Evaluation of annual lesion volume change (primary analysis) and T1 times (exploratory analysis) in 27 rim lesions vs 27 rimless lesions. RESULTS: Of 209 participants, 104 (50%) were women and 32 (15%) were African American. One hundred seventeen patients (56%) had at least 1 rim lesion regardless of prior or ongoing treatment. Further, 84 patients (40%) had no rims (mean [SD] age, 47 [14] years), 66 (32%) had 1 to 3 rims (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years), and 42 (20%) had 4 rims or more (mean [SD] age, 44 [11] years). Individuals with 4 rim lesions or more reached motor and cognitive disability at an earlier age. Normalized volumes of brain, white matter, and basal ganglia were lower in those with rim lesions. Whereas rimless lesions shrank over time (-3.6%/year), rim lesions were stable in size or expanded (2.2%/year; P < .001). Rim lesions had longer T1 times, suggesting more tissue destruction, than rimless lesions. On histopathological analysis, all 10 rim lesions that expanded in vivo had chronic active inflammation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Chronic active lesions are common, are associated with more aggressive disease, exert ongoing tissue damage, and occur even in individuals treated with effective disease-modifying therapies. These results prompt the planning of MRI-based clinical trials aimed at treating perilesional chronic inflammation in MS."

Currently there is no general gold standard to distinguish between CD and ITB tissues, which both have tuberculosis and surrounding fibrous structures. Mueller matrix imaging technique is suitable for describing the location, density and distribution behavior of such fibrous structures. In this study, we apply the Mueller matrix microscopic imaging to the CD and ITB tissue samples. The 2D Mueller matrix images of the CD and ITB tissue slices are measured using the Mueller matrix microscope developed in our previous study, then the Mueller matrix polar decomposition and Mueller matrix transformation parameters are calculated. To evaluate the distribution features of the fibrous structures surrounding the tuberculosis areas more quantitatively and precisely, we analyze the retardance related Mueller matrix derived parameters, which show clear different distribution behaviors between the CD and ITB tissues, using the Tamura image processing method. It is demonstrated that the Mueller matrix derived parameters can reveal the structural features of tuberculosis areas and be used as quantitative indicators to distinguish between CD and ITB tissues, which may be useful for the clinical diagnosis."

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,Hogg RT,Anat Rec (Hoboken),2019,2019/09/13,,,10.1002/ar.24261,"It is well recognized that enamel microanatomy in mammals reflects biomechanical demands placed upon teeth, as determined by mechanical properties of species' diets, use of teeth as weapons, and so forth. However, there are limited options for researchers wishing to perform large-scale comparisons of enamel microstructure with adaptive questions in mind. This is because to date there has been no efficient method for quantification and statistical analysis of enamel complexity. Our study proposes to apply a method previously developed for quantification of 3D tooth cusp morphology to the problem of quantifying microstructural enamel complexity. Here, we use image compression ratio (ICR) as a proxy variable for enamel complexity in 2D enamel photomicrographs taken using circularly polarized transmitted light microscopy. ICR describes the relationship between a digital image captured in an uncompressed file format and the identical image that has had its file size compressed using computer algorithms; more complex images receive less compression. In our analyses, ICR analysis is able to distinguish between images of teeth with simple, radial enamel and teeth with complex decussating enamel. Moreover, our results show a significant correlation between ICR and enamel complexity ranks assigned via visual assessment. Therefore, our results demonstrate that ICR analysis provides a viable methodology for efficient comparison of overall enamel complexity among dental samples. Anat Rec, 302:2279-2286, 2019.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of fusion of metabolic images (PET 18F-DOPA) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphological images for cerebral biopsy under stereotactic conditions of glioma without contrast enhancement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-center prospective observational study conducted between January 2016 and April 2018 included 20 consecutive patients (mean age: 45+/-19.5 years; range, 9-80 years) who underwent cerebral biopsy for a tumor without MRI enhancement but with hypermetabolism on (18)F-FDOPA PET (positron emission tomography). Standard (18)F-FDOPA uptake value (SUV(max)) was determined for diagnosis of high-grade glioma, with comparison to histomolecular results. RESULTS: Histological diagnosis was made in all patients (100%). Samples from hypermetabolism areas revealed high-grade glial tumor in 16 patients (80%). For a SUV(max) threshold of 1.75, sensitivity was 81.2%, specificity 50%, PPV 86.7% and VPN 40% for diagnosis of high-grade glioma. No significant association between SUV(max) and histomolecular mutation was found. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDOPA metabolic imaging is an aid in choosing the target to be biopsied under stereotactic conditions in tumors without MR enhancement. Nevertheless, despite good sensitivity, (18)F-FDOPA PET is insufficient for definitive diagnosis of high-grade tumor."

Thus, it is classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-4 agent. Since countermeasures for LASV diseases are yet to be developed, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the life cycle of the virus, including its viral and host cellular protein interactions. These underlying molecular mechanisms may serve as the key for developing novel therapeutic options. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a close relative of LASV, is usually asymptomatic and is categorized as a BSL-2 agent. In the present study, we visualized the transport of viral matrix Z protein in LCMV-infected cells using live-cell imaging microscopy. We demonstrated that the transport of Z protein is mediated by polymerized microtubules. Interestingly, the transport of LASV Z protein showed characteristics similar to those of Z protein in LCMV-infected cells. The live-cell imaging system using LCMV provides an attractive surrogate measure for studying arenavirus matrix protein transport in BSL-2 laboratories. In addition, it could be also utilized to analyze the interactions between viral matrix proteins and the cellular cytoskeleton, as well as to evaluate the antiviral compounds that target the transport of viral matrix proteins."

Assisted reproductive technology has been proven capable of alleviating infertility issues. In vitro fertilisation is one such option whose success is highly dependent on the selection of a high-quality embryo for transfer. This is typically done manually by analysing embryos under a microscope. However, evidence has shown that the success rate of manual selection remains low. The use of new incubators with integrated time-lapse imaging system is providing new possibilities for embryo assessment. As such, we address this problem by proposing an approach based on deep learning for automated embryo quality evaluation through the analysis of time-lapse images. Automatic embryo detection is complicated by the topological changes of a tracked object. Moreover, the algorithm should process a large number of image files of different qualities in a reasonable amount of time. METHODS: We propose an automated approach to detect human embryo development stages during incubation and to highlight embryos with abnormal behaviour by focusing on five different stages. This method encompasses two major steps. First, the location of an embryo in the image is detected by employing a Haar feature-based cascade classifier and leveraging the radiating lines. Then, a multi-class prediction model is developed to identify a total cell number in the embryo using the technique of deep learning. RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of at least 90% in the detection of embryo location. The implemented deep learning approach to identify the early stages of embryo development resulted in an overall accuracy of over 92% using the selected architectures of convolutional neural networks. The most problematic stage was the 3-cell stage, presumably due to its short duration during development. CONCLUSION: This research contributes to the field by proposing a model to automate the monitoring of early-stage human embryo development. Unlike in other imaging fields, only a few published attempts have involved leveraging deep learning in this field. Therefore, the approach presented in this study could be used in the creation of novel algorithms integrated into the assisted reproductive technology used by embryologists."

DATA DESCRIPTION: High-content screening confocal fluorescence microscopic image set of Salmonella infected HeLa cells is presented. The images were collected with a PerkinElmer Opera LX high-content screening system in seven 96-well plates, 50 field-of-views and DAPI, endoplasmic reticulum tracker channels and Salmonella mCherry protein in each well. Totally 93,300 confocal fluorescence microscopic images were published in this dataset. An ImageJ high-content image analysis workflow was used to extract features. Cells were classified as infected and non-infected, the mean intensity of endoplasmic reticulum tracker under Salmonella bacteria was calculated.

The dataset can be further used by researchers working with big data of endoplasmic reticulum fluorescence microscopic images, Salmonella bacterial infection images and human cancer cells."

In the next stage, the technology of acquiring explainable knowledge from medical images is highly desired. Here we show that deep learning algorithm enables automated acquisition of explainable features from diagnostic annotation-free histopathology images. We compare the prediction accuracy of prostate cancer recurrence using our algorithm-generated features with that of diagnosis by expert pathologists using established criteria on 13,188 whole-mount pathology images consisting of over 86 billion image patches. Our method not only reveals findings established by humans but also features that have not been recognized, showing higher accuracy than human in prognostic prediction. Combining both our algorithm-generated features and human-established criteria predicts the recurrence more accurately than using either method alone. We confirm robustness of our method using external validation datasets including 2276 pathology images. This study opens up fields of machine learning analysis for discovering uncharted knowledge."

We probed translational and rotational dynamics of functionalized Au nanostar (AuNS) nanoconstructs interacting with cells in serum-containing medium. We found that AuNS with targeting ligands had a larger dynamical footprint and faster rotational speed on cell membranes expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) receptors compared to that of AuNS with nontargeting ligands. Targeting and nontargeting nanoconstructs displayed distinct membrane dynamics despite their similar protein adsorption profiles, which suggests that targeted interactions are preserved even in the presence of a protein corona. The high sensitivity of single-NP dynamics can be used to compare different nanoconstruct properties (such as NP size, shape, and surface chemistry) to improve their design as delivery vehicles."

This study aims to provide a description of IRIS features of various gastroesophageal tissue types using histologic correlation. A database of 80 VLE laser-marked targets with histologic correlation was reviewed for various tissue types. IRIS was applied off-line to the VLE scans, laser-marked targets were identified, and feature review was performed. Squamous epithelium targets (N = 7) showed IRIS layered architecture with lack of surface hyper-reflectivity and epithelial glands. Gastric cardia targets (N = 10) showed absent layering (100%) and surface hyper-reflectivity with epithelial glands (40%). Nondysplastic BE targets (N = 39) showed surface hyper-reflectivity (64%), epithelial glands (51%), and lack of layering (74%). Targets of BE with early neoplasia (N = 24), showed surface hyper-reflectivity (96%), epithelial glands (67%), and lack of layering (96%). IRIS features that characterize each tissue type appear to mirror the nonenhanced VLE counterparts that define them."

Depending on the number, size and morphology of the polyethylene particles, biological responses of the periprosthetic soft tissue in terms of inflammatory processes can occur, leading to loosening of the implant. Various parameters are used to analyze wear particles, which are usually determined by examining scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images with a particle analysis program. In this study, three different software solutions for particle analysis (self-developed Particleanalyzer_HD, Leica QWin and ImageJ) were compared regarding particle number, size and morphology. These solutions were also compared to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F1877-16 specifications regarding particle morphology. SEM image analysis revealed no differences for the equivalent circle diameter (p = 0.969). However, a significant difference was found for the aspect ratio between the Particleanalyzer_HD and the other two software solutions (p < 0.001) and between Leica QWin and the other two software solutions regarding the roundness (p < 0.001). Only the Particleanalyzer_HD showed an excellent agreement with the ASTM standard for both morphology parameters (intraclass correlation = 1.000). Only the Particleanalyzer_HD calculated the two morphology parameters according to the ASTM standard. A comparison of the particle morphology between different studies is barely possible, as different algorithms for particle analysis are used. It is strongly recommended that the calculation according to the ASTM standard is used to improve future comparability of findings from wear analysis studies. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the physics of image acquisition intrinsically means that image quality is subject to a tradeoff between a number of imaging parameters, including resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and acquisition speed. We address the problem of geometric distortion, in particular, jaggedness artefacts that are caused by the variable motion of the microscope laser, by using a combination of image processing techniques. Image restoration methods have already shown great potential for post-acquisition image analysis. The performance of our proposed image restoration technique was first quantitatively evaluated using phantom data with different textures, and then qualitatively assessed using in vivo biological imaging data. In both cases, the presented method, comprising a combination of image registration and filtering, is demonstrated to have substantial improvement over state-of-the-art microscopy acquisition methods."

The aim of this study was to perform an architectural analysis of the cervical platysma-skin interaction, determine the morphological implications in platysmal band development and compare the findings to the facial SMAS architectural types. METHOD: Full-thickness blocks of skin, SMAS and platysma from seven hemifaces (three male and two female) and full-thickness blocks of skin, SMAS and mimic muscles of the periorbital, perioral, forehead and midfacial regions from six hemifaces (three male and three female) of donor bodies were collected postmortem. Serial histological sections were cut and stained with Azan. After the morphological analysis, three-dimensional reconstruction of the tissue block was performed with AutoCAD. The morphological and mechanical properties of the different facial SMAS types were compared with those of the cervical SMAS. RESULTS: The architecture of the cervical SMAS (type V) consists of parallel, aligned septum fibrosus profundus and septum fibrosus superficialis tissue connected by vertical, aligned septa fibrotica commisurales tissue delimiting fatty tissue compartments transferring platysmal contractions to the skin. The facial morphological dynamic mimic pattern (SMAS types I, II and III) describes the point-by-point transfer of mimic muscle bundle contractions to the skin, explaining facial crease formation. The cervical morphological dynamic mimic pattern (SMAS type V) can be explained by dual traction force collimation over the septum fibrosus superficialis and profundus in platysmal band development. CONCLUSIONS: The cervical SMAS (type V) description supports the hypothesis that the SMAS and platysma have different morphological origins. The two different facial and cervical morphological dynamic mimic patterns support the phenotypical difference between facial fold and platysmal band development."

Histologic evaluation methods have limitations. We present a simple method for measurement of collagen fibers in human skin using Masson's trichrome staining. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal skin specimens from a cadaver were processed with Masson's trichrome, which can effectively stain collagen fibers blue with aniline dye. Optical photomicrographs of these slides were analyzed using ImageJ software. Color image processing, a histogram-based function of ImageJ for image segmentation, was performed with color moments thresholding technique. We selected blue areas by adjusting the blue channel to include specific values. The selected areas were highlighted and evaluated. We divided the image into layers of 0.09-mm(2) areas from the top to bottom of the dermis. Each area was cropped and evaluated. RESULTS: Quantitative assessment yielded the quantitative size occupied by collagen fibers in an area of 0.09 mm(2) . Calculation of the percentage in each area can be used to determine the density of collagen fibers. CONCLUSION: Measurements obtained with our method can be applied to research on dermal collagen fibers. We present a convenient quantitative assessment method for the dermal constituents in Masson's trichrome-stained slides."

How to accurately assess tumor response after treatment is a crucial factor for developing reasonable therapeutic strategy. In this study, we were in an attempt to monitor tumor response by multimodal multiphoton imaging including two-photon excitation fluorescence and second-harmonic generation imaging. We found that multiphoton imaging can identify different degrees of tumor response such as a slight, significant, or complete response and can detect morphological alteration associated with extracellular matrix during the progression of breast carcinoma following preoperative chemotherapy. Two quantitative optical biomarkers including tumor cellularity and collagen content were extracted based on automatic image analysis to help monitor changes in tumor and its microenvironment. Furthermore, tumor regression grade diagnosis was tried to evaluate by multiphoton microscopy. These results may offer a basic framework for using multiphoton microscopic imaging techniques as a helpful diagnostic tool for assessing breast carcinoma response after presurgical treatment."

While many factors related to the changes of morphological and structural properties in muscle fibers and the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been considered as possible reasons for causing age-related force reduction, it is still not fully understood why the decrease in force generation under eccentric contraction (lengthening) is much less than that under concentric contraction (shortening). Biomechanically, it was observed that connective tissues (endomysium) stiffen as ages, and the volume ratio of connective tissues exhibits an age-related increase. However, limited skeletal muscle models take into account the microstructural characteristics as well as the volume fraction of tissue material. This study aims to provide a numerical investigation in which the muscle fibers and the ECM are explicitly represented to allow quantitative assessment of the age-related force reduction mechanism. To this end, a fiber-level honeycomb-like microstructure is constructed and modeled by a pixel-based Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM), which allows modeling of smooth transition in biomaterial properties across material interfaces. The numerical investigation reveals that the increased stiffness of the passive materials of muscle tissue reduces the force generation capability under concentric contraction while maintains the force generation capability under eccentric contraction. The proposed RKPM microscopic model provides effective means for the cellular-scale numerical investigation of skeletal muscle physiology. NOVELTY STATEMENT: A cellular-scale honeycomb-like microstructural muscle model constructed from a histological cross-sectional image of muscle is employed to study the causal relations between age-associated microstructural changes and age-related force loss using Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM). The employed RKPM offers an effective means for modeling biological materials based on pixel points in the medical images and allow modeling of smooth transition in the material properties across interfaces. The proposed microstructure-informed muscle model enables quantitative evaluation on how cellular-scale compositions contribute to muscle functionality and explain differences in age-related force changes during concentric, isometric and eccentric contractions."

We demonstrate how high-resolution imaging and optical modeling can be combined to reveal morphological features of a macular microcyst, offering insight into microcyst formation. OBJECTIVE: To use adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopic (AOSLO) images to track a transient retinal microcyst and derive its 3-dimensional shape. METHODS: A series of AOSLO images were gathered before, during, and after a transient retinal microcyst developed in an otherwise normal healthy 26-year-old male subject. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) independently confirmed the location of the microcyst. Optical modeling was conducted to quantify the lensing effect of the optically uniform microcyst and to determine its 3-dimensional shape. Increment threshold sensitivity, targeted within and around the microcyst, was tested to see if cone photoreceptor function was affected. RESULTS: A transient microcyst appeared as a 50 microm diameter circle in AOSLO images, localized to the inner nuclear layer. Based on image distortion of the photoreceptor mosaic, optical modeling suggests that the microcyst had the shape of an aspherical lens, distinguishable from a spherical, cylindrical, or elliptical shape, indicative of an edematous expansion of laminar tissue. The microcyst spontaneously resolved about 30 days after first discovery. No changes to the photoreceptor mosaic ensued from the presence of the microcyst, and functional testing of the photoreceptors below the microcyst indicated no loss of light sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Microcysts have been associated with numerous subtypes of optic nerve degeneration, including multiple sclerosis and various inherited neuropathies. This microcyst appeared in a healthy individual and resolved without intervention. Lensing effects can be used to determine microcyst shape, which cannot be resolved by OCT imaging, and to help infer etiology."

To comprehensively and quantitatively audit the tumor-immune microenvironment (TiME), we developed a novel multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) platform and computational image processing workflow using a single formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue section. Herein, we validated this platform using nine matched primary newly diagnosed and recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) sections sequentially subjected to immunodetection with a panel of 29 antibodies identifying malignant tumor cells, and 17 distinct leukocyte lineages and their functional states. Image cytometric analysis was applied to interpret chromogenic signals from digitally scanned and coregistered light microscopy-based images enabling identification and quantification of individual tumor cells, structural features, immune cell phenotypes and their functional state. In agreement with our previous study via a 12-plex imaging mIHC platform, myeloid-inflamed status in newly diagnosed primary tumors associated with significantly short progression free survival, independent of lymphoid-inflamed status. Spatial distribution of tumor and immune cell lineages in TiME was also examined and revealed statistically significant CD8(+) T cell exclusion from tumor nests, whereas regulatory T cells and myeloid cells, when present in close proximity to tumor cells, highly associated with rapid cancer recurrence. These findings indicate presence of differential immune-spatial profiles in newly diagnosed and recurrent HNSCC, and establish the robustness of the 29-plex mIHC platform and associated analytics for quantitative analysis of single tissue sections revealing longitudinal TiME changes."

Newly synthesized caveolin self-associates into oligomers that further assemble into higher-order structures. Imaging fluorescently labeled caveolin at the plasma membrane with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy reveals a spatially heterogeneous distribution with aggregates of various sizes. In this chapter, we present a set of image-processing tools to quantify the spatial organization and mobility of caveolin aggregates seen in TIRF images. We apply a spot detection algorithm to identify punctate features on multiple length scales, and computationally estimate the area and integrated fluorescence signal of each detected feature. We then partition the original image into two disjoint sets: one containing pixels within punctae, and the other containing pixels on the rest of the plasma membrane. From these partitions, we estimate the relative fraction of caveolin that is punctate versus diffuse. Finally, we analyze the mobility of caveolin aggregates by tracking them and classify individual trajectories as diffusive or subdiffusive using a moment scaling spectrum analysis. Together, these analyses capture multiple facets of caveolin organization and dynamics. To demonstrate their utility, we quantify the distribution of fluorescent Caveolin 1 stably transfected in HeLa cells. We analyze cells at baseline and after being exposed to the anesthetic Dibucaine that is known to scramble membrane phospholipids. Our analysis shows how this perturbation dramatically alters caveolin aggregation and mobility."

In contrast to standard FISH techniques, COMBO-FISH makes use of a bioinformatic search in sequence databases for probe design, so that it can be done for any species so far sequenced. In the original approach, oligonucleotide stretches of typical lengths of 15-30 nucleotides were selected in such a way that they only co-localize at the given genome target. Typical probe sets of about 20-40 stretches were used to label about 50-250 kb specifically. The probes of different lengths can be composed of purines and pyrimidines, but were often restricted to homo-purine or homo-pyrimidine probe sets because of the experimental advantage of using a protocol omitting denaturation of the target strand and triple strand binding of the probes. This allows for a better conservation of the 3D folding and arrangement of the genome. With an improved, rigorous genome sequence database analysis and sequence search according to statistical frequency and uniqueness, a novel family of probes repetitively binding to characteristic genome features like SINEs (Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements, e.g., ALU elements), LINEs (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements, e.g., L1), or centromeres has been developed. These probes can be synthesized commercially as DNA or PNA probes with high purity and labeled by fluorescent dye molecules. Here, new protocols are described for purine-pyrimidine probes omitting heat treatment for denaturation of the target so that oligonucleotide labeling can also be combined with immune-staining by specific antibodies. If the dyes linked to the oligonucleotide stretches undergo reversible photo-bleaching (laser-induced slow blinking), the labeled cell nuclei can be further subjected to super-resolution localization microscopy for complex chromatin architecture research."

The problem is exacerbated in organ sites such as the prostate, where unnecessarily wide local excisions can result in significant deterioration of post-operative quality of life due to collateral damage to neighboring structures. Yet, at the same time, incomplete tumor removal results in worsened prognosis and need for additional interventions. Here, we report the design and development of a rapid and completely automated system for intraoperative gigapixel ex vivo microscopy of the circumferential surgical prostate margin within intra-operative timeframes, called the Automated Prostate Positioning System (APPS). The APPS leverages the rotational geometry of the prostate and high speed structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to generate continuous gigapixel panoramas of the fresh intact prostate circumference, including areas of the prostate adjacent to the neurovascular bundles, the rectum, and the bladder wall. Our previous work using SIM and a manual prostate handling method demonstrated the promise of the imaging technique for accurate detection of positive surgical margins. Our work here advances the technology toward clinical adoption, by demonstrating 10% greater tissue surface coverage fraction, 1.6x faster imaging throughput, and reduced number of required operator steps, compared to our prior approach. The APPS may be operated by a single person in the operating room suite within intraoperative time limits, while simultaneously delivering nearly two orders of magnitude higher tissue surface coverage than destructive and labor-intensive frozen section analysis techniques."

Clots are biocomposite materials composed of fibrin network enmeshing platelets and other blood cells. We have previously shown that the storage temperature of platelets significantly impacts clot structure and stiffness. The objective of this work is to delineate the relationship between morphological characteristics and mechanical response of clot networks. We examined scanning electron microscope images of clots prepared from fresh apheresis platelets, and from apheresis platelets stored for 5 days at room temperature or at 4  degrees C, suspended in pooled plasma. Principal component analysis of nine different morphometric parameters revealed that a single principal component (PC1) can distinguish the effect of platelet storage on clot ultrastructure. Finite element analysis of clot response to uniaxial strain was used to map the spatially heterogeneous distribution of strain energy density for each clot. At modest deformations (25% strain), a single principal component (PC2) was able to predict these heterogeneities as quantified by variability in strain energy density distribution and in linear elastic stiffness, respectively. We have identified structural parameters that are primary regulators of stress distribution, and the observations provide insights into the importance of spatial heterogeneity on hemostasis and thrombosis."

However, it is unknown how this reconfiguration of the collagen matrix affects disease progression. Here, we investigate the role of specific alterations in collagen fiber organization on cell migration dynamics by using biomimetic image-based collagen scaffolds representing normal and fibrotic lung, where the designs are derived directly from high-resolution second harmonic generation microscopy images. The scaffolds are fabricated by multiphoton-excited (MPE) polymerization, where the process is akin to three-dimensional printing, except that it is performed at much greater resolution ( approximately 0.5 microns) and with collagen and collagen analogs. These scaffolds were seeded with early passaged primary human normal and IPF fibroblasts to enable the decoupling of the effect of cell-intrinsic characteristics (normal vs. IPF) versus ECM structure (normal vs. IPF) on migration dynamics. We found that the highly aligned IPF collagen structure promoted enhanced cell elongation and F-actin alignment along with increased cell migration speed and straightness relative to the normal tissues. Collectively, the data are consistent with an enhanced contact guidance mechanism on the aligned IPF matrix. Although cell intrinsic effects were observed, the aligned collagen matrix morphology had a larger effect on these metrics. Importantly, these biomimetic models of the lung cannot be synthesized by conventional fabrication methods. We suggest that the MPE image-based fabrication method will enable additional hypothesis-based testing studies of cell-matrix interactions in the context of tissue fibrosis."

Force transmission to the brain and spinal cord from a mandibular impact such as a punch was evaluated by the creation and validation of a complete finite element model of the head and neck. Anteroposterior uppercut impacts on the jaw were associated with considerable extension and strong stresses at the junction of the brainstem and spinal cord. Hook punch impacts transmitted forces directly to the brainstem and the spinal cord without extension of the spinal cord. Deaths after this type of blow with no observed histological lesions may be related to excessive stressing of the brainstem, through which pass the sensory-motor pathways and the vagus nerve and which is the regulatory center of the major vegetative functions. Biological parameters are different in each individual, and by using digital modeling they can be modulated at will (jaw shape, dentition...) for a realistic approach to forensic applications."

There are no studies evaluating the morphometric measures in subjects after long-term CI use, and this study fills in this gap in current knowledge, greatly important for the design of CI electrodes. Amira based 3-D reconstructions of the cochlea were generated from stained histopathological slides of 15 celloidin-embedded human temporal bones. The SGN angular distance from the round window exhibited a narrow range from 684 degrees -704 degrees , corresponding to linear distances of 17.87 and 34.48 mm along the inner and outer wall of the scala tympani. The first turn measured an average of 14.21 mm along the inner wall and 23.92 mm along the outer wall. The outer wall average for the second turn was 11.11 mm and for the partial third apical turn was only 4.49 mm. The range for cochlear duct angular distance was 876 degrees  to 1051 degrees , with a mean of 2.63 turns, corresponding to an average linear distance of 39.53 mm, ranging from 35.44 mm to 43.57 mm 6 out of 15 temporal bones demonstrated better preservation of SGN in the middle and apical segments of Rosenthal's canal. The present study demonstrates that the anatomy of the cochlea of CI patients does not differ significantly from that of normative subjects and establishes measurements using the round window as the 0 degrees  reference point, an important surgical landmark. The relevance of the measurements to cochlear implant design are discussed."

The spatial frequencies of MM elements reveal reliable information of microscopic structural organization arising from the different orientations of collagen fibers in the connective tissue and their randomization with disease progression. Specifically, the local disorder generated in the normal periodic and regular structure of collagen during the growth of the cervical cancer finds characteristic manifestation in the Fourier spectrum of the selected Mueller matrix elements encoding the anisotropy effects through retardance and birefringence. In contrast, Fourier spectra of differential polarization gated images are limited to only one orientation of collagen. Fourier spectra of first row elements M11, M12, M13, and M14 and first column elements M11, M21, M31, and M41 discriminates cervical inter-epithelial neoplasia (CIN)-I from normal cervical tissue samples with 95%-100% sensitivity and specificity. FFT spectra of first and fourth row elements classify CIN-I and CIN-II grades of cervical cancerous tissues with 90%-100% sensitivity and 87%-100% specificity. Normal and CIN-II grade samples are successfully discriminated through Fourier spectra of every MM element while that of M31 element arises as the key classifier among normal, CIN-I, and CIN-II grades of cervical cancer with 100% sensitivity and specificity. These results demonstrate the promise of spatial frequency analysis of Mueller matrix images as a novel, to the best of our knowledge, approach for cancer/precancer detection."

Using the brain atlas as a hub, mapping detected datasets into a standard brain space enables efficient use of various datasets. However, because of the heterogeneous and nonuniform brain structure characteristics at the cellular level introduced by recently developed high-resolution whole-brain microscopy techniques, it is difficult to apply a single standard to robust registration of various large-volume datasets. In this study, we propose a robust Brain Spatial Mapping Interface (BrainsMapi) to address the registration of large-volume datasets by introducing extracted anatomically invariant regional features and a large-volume data transformation method. By performing validation on model data and biological images, BrainsMapi achieves accurate registration on intramodal, individual, and multimodality datasets and can also complete the registration of large-volume datasets (approximately 20 TB) within 1 day. In addition, it can register and integrate unregistered vectorized datasets into a common brain space. BrainsMapi will facilitate the comparison, reuse and integration of a variety of brain datasets."

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established an open-source software-based analytic pipeline for quantifying TILs and the TSR from whole-slide images obtained after CD3 and CD8 IHC staining. Using a random forest classifier, the method separately quantified intraepithelial TILs (iTIL) and stromal TILs (sTIL). We applied this method to discovery and validation cohorts of 578 and 283 stage III or high-risk stage II colorectal cancers patients, respectively, who were subjected to curative surgical resection and oxlaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Automatic quantification of iTILs and sTILs showed a moderate concordance with that obtained after visual inspection by a pathologist. The K-means-based consensus clustering of 197 TIME parameters that showed robustness against interobserver variations caused colorectal cancers to be grouped into five distinctive subgroups, reminiscent of those for consensus molecular subtypes (CMS1-4 and mixed/intermediate group). In accordance with the original CMS report, the CMS4-like subgroup (cluster 4) was significantly associated with a worse 5-year relapse-free survival and proved to be an independent prognostic factor. The clinicopathologic and prognostic features of the TIME subgroups have been validated in an independent validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning-based image analysis can be useful for extracting quantitative information about the TIME, using whole-slide histopathologic images. This information can classify colorectal cancers into clinicopathologically relevant subgroups without performing a molecular analysis of the tumors."

However, many focal abnormalities remain undetected during routine visual inspection, and many patients with histologically confirmed FCD have normal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR-negative) images. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the changes in cortical thickness with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of patients to identify FCD lesions from FLAIR-negative images. METHODS: We first used the three-dimensional (3D) Laplace method to calculate the cortical thickness for individuals and obtained the cortical thickness mean image and cortical thickness standard deviation (SD) image based on all 32 healthy controls. Then, a cortical thickness extension map was computed by subtracting the cortical thickness mean image from the cortical thickness image of each patient and dividing the result by the cortical thickness SD image. Finally, clusters of voxels larger than three were defined as the FCD lesion area from the cortical thickness extension map. RESULTS: The results showed that three of the four lesions that occurred in non-temporal areas were detected in three patients, but the detection failed in three patients with lesions that occurred in the temporal area. The quantitative analysis of the detected lesions in voxel-wise on images revealed the following: specificity (99.78%), accuracy (99.76%), recall (67.45%), precision (20.42%), Dice coefficient (30.01%), Youden index (67.23%) and area under the curve (AUC) (83.62%). CONCLUSION: Our studies demonstrate an effective method to localize lesions in non-temporal lobe regions. This novel method automatically detected FCD lesions using only FLAIR-negative images from patients and was based only on cortical thickness feature. The method is noninvasive and more effective than a visual analysis for helping doctors make a diagnosis."

Diffusion and perfusion information from intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) might be useful for this distinction. PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of IVIM-DWI in discriminating borderline from malignant OETs by correlating with cell proliferation and microvessel density (MVD). STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: Sixty-six patients with OETs (22 borderline, BOETs; 44 malignant, MOETs) underwent IVIM-DWI before surgery. FIELD STRENGTH: 3.0T IVIM-DWI sequence with 12 b-values (0-1000 sec/mm(2) ). ASSESSMENT: Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IVIM-DWI parameters (diffusion coefficient [D], microvascular volume fraction [f], and pseudodiffusion coefficient [D*]) were measured. Cell proliferation and MVD was determined by immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67 and CD-31, respectively. STATISTICAL TESTS: Mann-Whitney U-test; two-sample t-test; intraclass correlation coefficient; Bland-Altman analysis; receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves; and Spearman correlation. RESULTS: ADC and D in BOETs was significantly higher than those in MOETs (P < 0.001), while f in BOETs was significantly lower than those in MOETs (P < 0.001). No significant difference was found in D* between borderline and malignancies (P = 0.324). In the differential diagnosis of borderline from malignant OETs; D demonstrated the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.951, while ADC and f had a lower AUC of 0.921 and 0.847, respectively. The ADC and D was negatively correlated with cell proliferation (r = -0.682, r = -0.694, respectively, P < 0.001), while f was positively correlated with MVD of the OETs (r = 0.558, P < 0.001). DATA CONCLUSION: IVIM-DWI may be a useful tool for differentiating BOETs from MOETs. D and f could be image biomarkers to reflect histopathological characteristics of cell proliferation and MVD in OETs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J. Magn. Reson.

In GI-NET, a spectrum of histological and molecular parameters exists to predict prognosis and survival. Immunohistochemistry for Ki67, a nuclear antigen that is present in all but the G0 phase of the cell cycle with specificity for proliferating cells, can be used to determine a tumors proliferation index. With this in mind, grading of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors is critical for prognosis and can impact clinical decision making. Recently, digital image analysis (DIA) has been shown in studies to be a superior and less time-consuming alternative to the manual scoring of Ki-67 in breast cancer, secondary to its theoretical diagnostic reproducibility. In DIA, the correct identification of tumor cells and non-tumor is paramount to avoid over or under calculation of biomarker expression. Additionally, DIA requires a pathologist to manually outline a tumor in large tissue areas of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections, which is impractical. The findings in our study showed that ventana virtuoso software computer analyzed Ki-67 only correlated well with Neuroendocrine carcinomas while manual analysis of mitotic index and Ki67 were found to be gold standard. The performance of DIA in our study was plagued by software issues. In future, the advent of new digital imaging technologies such as virtual dual staining will hopefully improve diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility across different DIA platforms. Ultimately, determination of therapeutic strategies should be guided by an amalgamation of clinicopathologic characteristics not limited to mitotic index and Ki-67. As well, A visual check of the results should always be performed and correlated with other findings."

The restoration of the STM image defects usually needs human judgements and manual positioning because of the diversity of the morphology and the randomness of the defects. This paper provides a new fully-automatic method that combines deep convolutional neural classification network and unique restoration algorithms corresponding to different defects. Aimed at automatically processing compound defects in STM images, the method first predicts what kinds of defects a raw STM image has by a series of parallel binary classification networks, and then decides the process order according to the predicted labels, and finally restores the defects by corresponding global restoration algorithms in order. Experiment results prove the provided method can restore the STM images by self-judging, self-positioning, self-processing without any manual intervention."

This analysis distinguished between noncancer and cancer tissues with different histological grades. We then classified the H&E-stained images by expression levels of cancer-associated nuclear ATF7IP/MCAF1 and membranous PD-L1 proteins using immunohistochemistry of serial sections. Interestingly, classes with low and high expressions of each protein exhibited significant morphological dissimilarity in H&E images. These results indicated that morphological features in cancer tissues are correlated with expression of specific cancer-associated proteins, suggesting the usefulness of biomolecular-based morphological classification."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Abdominal magnetization transfer imaging from 20 consecutive CD patients were analyzed before performing elective operations. MTR parameters were calculated by delineating regions of interest in specified segments on MTR maps. Specimens with pathologically confirmed bowel fibrosis were classified into one of four severity grades. The correlation between MTR parameters and fibrosis score was tested by Spearman's rank correlation. Differences in MTR, normalized MTR, and standardized MTR across diverse histologic fibrosis scores were analyzed using the independent sample t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed to test the efficacies of the MTR parameters in differentiating severe intestinal fibrosis from mild-to-moderate fibrosis. RESULTS: Normalized (r = 0.700; p < 0.001) and standardized MTR (r = 0.695; p < 0.001) showed a strong correlation with bowel fibrosis scores, followed by MTR (r = 0.590; p < 0.001). Significant differences in MTR (t = -4.470; p < 0.001), normalized MTR (Z = -5.003; p < 0.001), and standardized MTR (Z = -5.133; p < 0.001) were found between mild-to-moderate and severe bowel fibrosis. Standardized MTR (AUC = 0.895; p < 0.001) had the highest accuracy in differentiating severe bowel fibrosis from mild-to-moderate bowel wall fibrosis, followed by normalized MTR (AUC = 0.885; p < 0.001) and MTR (AUC = 0.798; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Standardized MTR is slightly superior to MTR and normalized MTR and therefore may be an optimal parameter for evaluating the severity of intestinal fibrosis in CD."

The measurement accuracy of QPM strongly relies on the shape of the recorded interferograms, whether straight or curved fringes are recorded during the data acquisition. Moreover, for a single shot phase recovery high fringe density is required. The wavefront curvature for the high-density fringes over the entire field of view is difficult to be discerned with the naked eye. As a consequence, there is a quadratic phase aberration in the recovered phase images due to curvature mismatch. In the present work, we have implemented sampling moire method for real-time sensing of the wavefront curvature mismatch between the object and the reference wavefronts and further for its correction. By zooming out the interferogram, moire fringes are generated which helps to easily identify the curvature of the fringes. The wavefront curvature mismatch correction accuracy of the method is tested with the help of low temporal coherent light source such as a white light (temporal coherence  approximately  1.6 microm). The proposed scheme is successfully demonstrated to remove the quadratic phase aberration caused due to wavefront mismatch from an USAF resolution target and the biological tissue samples. The phase recovery accuracy of the current scheme is further compared with and found to better than the standard method called principle component analysis. The proposed method enables recording of the corrected wavefront interferogram without needing any additional optical components or modification and also does not need any post-processing correction algorithms. The proposed method of curvature compensation paves the path for a high-throughput and accurate quantitative phase imaging."

GB detection is a challenging application, showing high heterogeneity in the cellular morphology across different patients. We employed an HSI microscope, with a spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm, to collect 517 HS cubes from 13 GB patients using 20x magnification. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), we were able to automatically detect GB within the pathological slides, achieving average sensitivity and specificity values of 88% and 77%, respectively, representing an improvement of 7% and 8% respectively, as compared to the results obtained using RGB (red, green, and blue) images.

In this paper we propose a hierarchical Markov random field (MRF) model for brain region segmentation, where a MRF is applied to the downsampled low-resolution images and the result is used to initialize another MRF for the original high-resolution images. A fractional differential feature and a gray level co-occurrence matrix are extracted as the observed vector for the MRF and a new potential energy function, which can capture the spatial characteristic of brain regions, is proposed as well. A fuzzy entropy criterion is used to fine-tune the boundary from the hierarchical MRF model. We test the model both on synthetic images and real histological mouse brain images. The result suggests that the model can accurately identify target regions and even the whole mouse brain outline as a special case. An interesting observation is that the model cannot only segment regions with different cell density but also can segment regions with similar cell density and different cell morphology texture. Thus this model shows great potential for building the high-resolution 3D brain atlas."

Epub 2019 Aug 19.,Tennakoon R,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,2020,2019/08/20,,,10.1109/TMI.2019.2936244,"Volumetric imaging is an essential diagnostic tool for medical practitioners. The use of popular techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) for analysis of volumetric images is constrained by the availability of detailed (with local annotations) training data and GPU memory. In this paper, the volumetric image classification problem is posed as a multi-instance classification problem and a novel method is proposed to adaptively select positive instances from positive bags during the training phase. This method uses the extreme value theory to model the feature distribution of the images without a pathology and use it to identify positive instances of an imaged pathology. The experimental results, on three separate image classification tasks (i.e. classify retinal OCT images according to the presence or absence of fluid build-ups, emphysema detection in pulmonary 3D-CT images and detection of cancerous regions in 2D histopathology images) show that the proposed method produces classifiers that have similar performance to fully supervised methods and achieves the state of the art performance in all examined test cases."

An approximately 192,310 new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in 2019, which shows the importance of automated systems for the diagnosis process. Accordingly, this article presents an automated method for skin lesions detection and recognition using pixel-based seed segmented images fusion and multilevel features reduction. The proposed method involves four key steps: (a) mean-based function is implemented and fed input to top-hat and bottom-hat filters which later fused for contrast stretching, (b) seed region growing and graph-cut method-based lesion segmentation and fused both segmented lesions through pixel-based fusion, (c) multilevel features such as histogram oriented gradient (HOG), speeded up robust features (SURF), and color are extracted and simple concatenation is performed, and (d) finally variance precise entropy-based features reduction and classification through SVM via cubic kernel function. Two different experiments are performed for the evaluation of this method. The segmentation performance is evaluated on PH2, ISBI2016, and ISIC2017 with an accuracy of 95.86, 94.79, and 94.92%, respectively. The classification performance is evaluated on PH2 and ISBI2016 dataset with an accuracy of 98.20 and 95.42%, respectively. The results of the proposed automated systems are outstanding as compared to the current techniques reported in state of art, which demonstrate the validity of the proposed method."

Extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis has a poor prognosis and its pathophysiology is not well understood. Although treatment with systemic intravenous chemotherapy is often initially successful, peritoneal recurrences occur regularly. We hypothesized that insufficient or poorly-perfused microvasculature may impair the therapeutic efficacy of systemic intravenous chemotherapy but may also limit expansive and invasive growth characteristic of peritoneal EOC metastases. In 23 patients with advanced EOC or suspicion thereof, we determined the angioarchitecture and perfusion of the microvasculature in peritoneum and in peritoneal metastases using incident dark field (IDF) imaging. Additionally, we performed immunohistochemical analysis and 3-dimensional (3D) whole tumor imaging using light sheet fluorescence microscopy of IDF-imaged tissue sites. In all metastases, microvasculature was present but the angioarchitecture was chaotic and the vessel density and perfusion of vessels was significantly lower than in unaffected peritoneum. Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha, and 3D imaging demonstrated vascular continuity between metastases and the vascular network of the peritoneum beneath the elastic lamina of the peritoneum. We conclude that perfusion of the microvasculature within metastases is limited, which may cause hypoxia, affect the behavior of EOC metastases on the peritoneum and limit the response of EOC metastases to systemic treatment."

Recently, we reported motion of the human CP in the cochlear base that differs substantially from the classic view. We described a human soft tissue ""bridge"" (non-existent in the classic view) between the osseous spiral lamina (OSL) and basilar membrane (BM), and showed how OSL and bridge move in response to sound. Here, we detail relevant human anatomy to better understand the relationship between form and function. The bridge and BM have similar widths that increase linearly from base to apex, whereas the OSL width decreases from base to apex, leading to an approximately constant total CP width throughout the cochlea. The bony three-dimensional OSL microstructure, reconstructed from unconventionally thin, 2-mum histological sections, revealed thin, radially wide OSL plates with pores that vary in size, extent, and distribution with cochlear location. Polarized light microscopy revealed collagen fibers in the BM that spread out medially through the bridge to connect to the OSL. The long width and porosity of the OSL may explain its considerable bending flexibility. The similarity of BM and bridge widths along the cochlea, both containing continuous collagen fibers, may make them a functional unit and allow maximum CP motion near the bridge-BM boundary, as recently described. These anatomical findings may help us better understand the motion of the structures surrounding the organ of Corti and how they shape the input to the cochlear sensory mechanism."

In the simple architecture of DLHM based on a point source and a digital camera, the production of the former is introduced by means of an engineered step-index optical fiber with a cone-shaped end tip. The conventional and regularly expensive point source in DLHM is produced by means of a high-numerical-aperture microscope objective and a metallic wavelength-sized pinhole. The proposed replacement renders to DLHM additional simplicity of building, in addition to mechanical stability and robustness, and further reduces the cost of the microscope. The simplified cost-effective DLHM architecture is utilized for imaging resolution test targets and samples of human blood and pond water, revealing competitive mechanical stability and trustable phase images of the imaged specimens."

The required labeling of proteins of interest, however, can be challenging and potentially perturb biomolecular functionality as well as cause imaging artefacts and photo bleaching issues. Here, we introduce inverse (super-resolution) imaging of unlabeled proteins bound to DNA. In this new method, we use DNA-binding fluorophores that transiently label bare DNA but not protein-bound DNA. In addition to demonstrating diffraction-limited inverse imaging, we show that inverse Binding-Activated Localization Microscopy or 'iBALM' can resolve biomolecular features smaller than the diffraction limit. The current detection limit is estimated to lie at features between 5 and 15 nm in size. Although the current image-acquisition times preclude super-resolving fast dynamics, we show that diffraction-limited inverse imaging can reveal molecular mobility at  approximately 0.2 s temporal resolution and that the method works both with DNA-intercalating and non-intercalating dyes. Our experiments show that such inverse imaging approaches are valuable additions to the single-molecule toolkit that relieve potential limitations posed by labeling."

TCs were previously found around stem and progenitor cells, and were thought to be most likely involved in local tissue metabolic equilibrium and regeneration. The roles of telocytes are still under scientific scrutiny, with existing studies suggesting they possess various functions depending on their location. METHODS: Human myometrium biopsies were collected from pregnant and non-pregnant women, telocytes were then investigated in myometrial interstitial cell cultures based on morphological criteria and later prepared for time-lapse microscopy. Semi-analytical and numerical solutions were developed to highlight the geometric characteristics and the behavior of telocytes. RESULTS: Results were gathered in a database which would further allow efficient telocyte tracking and indexing in a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of digital medical images. Mathematical analysis revealed pivotal information regarding the homogeneity, hardness and resistance of telocytes' structure. Cellular activity models were monitored in vitro, therefore supporting the creation of databases of telocyte images. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained images were analyzed, using segmentation techniques and mathematical models in conjunction with computer simulation, in order to depict TCs behavior in relation to surrounding cells. This paper brings an important contribution to the development of bioinformatics systems by creating software-based telocyte models that could be used both for diagnostic and educational purposes."

An automatic computational pipeline is implemented to extract image features. Comparative study identifies 52 image features with significant differences between TFE3-RCC and ccRCC. Machine learning models are built to distinguish TFE3-RCC from ccRCC. Tests of the classification models on an external validation set reveal high accuracy with areas under ROC curve ranging from 0.842 to 0.894. Our results suggest that automatically derived image features can capture subtle morphological differences between TFE3-RCC and ccRCC and contribute to a potential guideline for TFE3-RCC diagnosis."

Although progress has been made on understanding biochemical characteristics of epigenetic modifications in cancer, the in-situ higher-order folding of chromatin structure during malignant transformation remains largely unknown. Here, using optimized stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) for pathological tissue (PathSTORM), we uncover a gradual decompaction and fragmentation of higher-order chromatin folding throughout all stages of carcinogenesis in multiple tumor types, and prior to tumor formation. Our integrated imaging, genomic, and transcriptomic analyses reveal functional consequences in enhanced transcription activities and impaired genomic stability. We also demonstrate the potential of imaging higher-order chromatin disruption to detect high-risk precursors that cannot be distinguished by conventional pathology. Taken together, our findings reveal gradual decompaction and fragmentation of higher-order chromatin structure as an enabling characteristic in early carcinogenesis to facilitate malignant transformation, which may improve cancer diagnosis, risk stratification, and prevention."

However, cell staining is not always allowed in certain medical procedures. In other cases, staining may be time-consuming or expensive to implement. Staining protocols may be operator-sensitive, and hence may lead to varying analytical results, as well as cause artificial imaging artifacts or false heterogeneity. We present a deep-learning approach, called HoloStain, which converts images of isolated biological cells acquired without staining by holographic microscopy to their virtually stained images. We demonstrate this approach for human sperm cells, as there is a well-established protocol and global standardization for characterizing the morphology of stained human sperm cells for fertility evaluation, but, on the other hand, staining might be cytotoxic and thus is not allowed during human in vitro fertilization (IVF). After a training process, the deep neural network can take images of unseen sperm cells retrieved from holograms acquired without staining and convert them to their stainlike images. We obtained a fivefold recall improvement in the analysis results, demonstrating the advantage of using virtual staining for sperm cell analysis. With the introduction of simple holographic imaging methods in clinical settings, the proposed method has a great potential to become a common practice in human IVF procedures, as well as to significantly simplify and radically change other cell analyses and techniques such as imaging flow cytometry."

We assessed the usefulness of NODDI for the differentiation of glioblastoma from solitary brain metastasis. METHODS: NODDI data were prospectively obtained on a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner from patients with previously untreated, histopathologically confirmed glioblastoma (n = 9) or solitary brain metastasis (n = 6). Using the NODDI Matlab Toolbox, we generated maps of the intra-cellular, extra-cellular, and isotropic volume (VIC, VEC, VISO) fraction. Apparent diffusion coefficient - and fraction anisotropy maps were created from the diffusion data. On each map we manually drew a region of interest around the peritumoral signal-change (PSC) - and the enhancing solid area of the lesion. Differences between glioblastoma and metastatic lesions were assessed and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was determined. RESULTS: On VEC maps the mean value of the PSC area was significantly higher for glioblastoma than metastasis (P < 0.05); on VISO maps it tended to be higher for metastasis than glioblastoma. There was no significant difference on the other maps. Among the 5 parameters, the VEC fraction in the PSC area showed the highest diagnostic performance. The VEC threshold value of >/= 0.48 yielded 100% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity, and an AUC of 0.87 for differentiating between the two tumor types. CONCLUSIONS: NODDI compartment maps of the PSC area may help to differentiate between glioblastoma and solitary brain metastasis."

Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is an important biomarker of the response to cancer immunotherapy. We investigated the relationship between TMB and the imaging, histologic, and genetic features in NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the associations between the semantic imaging features (7 quantitative or semiquantitative imaging features and 13 qualitative features that reflect the tumor characteristics) and TMB and built an imaging signature for TMB using logistic regression. Finally, we integrated the imaging signature, histologic type, and TP53 genotype into a composite model. RESULTS: Among 89 patients, 37 (41.6%) had low TMB and 52 (58.4%) had high TMB. Tumors with high TMB were more prevalent in squamous cell carcinoma (P = .017) and those with a TP53 mutation (P < .0001). The absence of concavity was significantly associated with higher TMB (P = .008). An imaging signature containing 5 features, including concavity, border definition, spiculation, thickened adjacent bronchovascular bundle and size, achieved good discrimination between tumors with low and high TMB (area under the curve [AUC], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.89). The composite model integrating the imaging signature, histologic type, and TP53 genotype improved the classification (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.95) compared with the imaging signature alone using the DeLong test (P = .012). The composite model achieved a high sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 62%. CONCLUSION: Specific computed tomography features are associated with TMB in NSCLC, and the integration of imaging, histologic, and genetic information might allow for accurate prediction of TMB."

A MN assay slide is automatically scanned by the RS-MN then the binucleated cells and micronuclei are automatically identified. Processing 1000 cells takes 10-60 minutes by automatic scoring (scanning plus image processing) depending on sample quality and required accuracy. The manual revision of the cell gallery takes an extra 10 minutes per sample. Dose response curves are determined for manual, automatic and semi-automatic scoring methods.Results: The combination of object-sensitive autofocusing method and the multi-layer image acquisition is able to reduce the minimum resolvable dose by 14%. The MN yields obtained from the manual, semi-automatic and automatic scoring methods are well correlating (Pearson's correlation coefficients are between 0.977 and 0.998). In order to compare the reliability of the results of visual and automatic scoring, an extended analysis on uncertainty contributors was performed. For a dose of 1 Gy, the estimated relative uncertainty from the Poisson characteristics of MN yield is 17-19% for the manual and 20-38% for the automated scoring. Other uncertainty factors (differences in donor radiosensitivity, scorer performance, and sample preparations) can contribute to this error fall within a similar range: 3-16%. Taking into account all of the possible uncertainties, the minimum resolvable dose for the manual (0.48 Gy) is the two-thirds of that of the automatic scoring (0.61 Gy).Conclusions: The results verify that the fully automatic mode of RS-MN is suitable for triage purposes. The performance of the user interacted semi-automatic mode is comparable with the reference manual scoring. Its performance reaches up to other non-fluorescent automatic systems and offers a compact and cost-effective alternative."

Precise segmentation of TE is an important step toward achieving automatic human embryo quality assessment based on morphological image features. Automatic segmentation of TE, however, is a challenging task and previous work on this is quite limited. In this paper, four fully convolutional deep models are proposed for accurate segmentation of trophectoderm in microscopic images of the human blastocyst. In addition, a multi-scaled ensembling method is proposed that aggregates five models trained at various scales offering trade-offs between the quantity and quality of the spatial information. Furthermore, synthetic embryo images are generated for the first time to address the lack of data in training deep learning models. These synthetically generated images are proven to be effective to fill the generalization gap in deep learning when limited data is available for training. Experimental results confirm that the proposed models are capable of segmenting TE regions with an average Precision, Recall, Accuracy, Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index of 83.8%, 90.1%, 96.9%, 86.61% and 76.71%, respectively. Particularly, the proposed Inceptioned U-Net model outperforms state-of-the-art by 10.3% in Accuracy, 9.3% in Dice Coefficient and 13.7% in Jaccard Index. Further experiments are conducted to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed models compared to some recent deep learning based segmentation methods."

Knowledge of intracellular accumulation and distribution is limited. Using high-resolution microscopy techniques, we determined the total number of granules per cell, intracellular distribution, and changes related to retinal topography and age. METHODS: RPE cells from the fovea, perifovea, and near-periphery of 15 human RPE flat mounts were imaged using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and confocal fluorescence microscopy in young (</=51 years, n = 8) and older (>80 years, n = 7) donors. Using custom FIJI plugins, granules were marked with computer assistance, classified based on morphological and autofluorescence properties, and analyzed with regard to intracellular distribution, total number per cell, and granule density. RESULTS: A total of 193,096 granules in 450 RPE cell bodies were analyzed. Based on autofluorescence properties, size, and composition, the RPE granules exhibited nine different phenotypes (lipofuscin, two; melanolipofuscin, five; melanosomes, two), distinguishable by SIM. Overall, lipofuscin (low at the fovea but increases with eccentricity and age) and melanolipofuscin (equally distributed at all three locations with no age-related changes) were the major granule types. Melanosomes were under-represented due to suboptimal visualization of apical processes in flat mounts. CONCLUSIONS: Low lipofuscin and high melanolipofuscin content within foveal RPE cell bodies and abundant lipofuscin at the perifovea suggest a different genesis, plausibly related to the population of overlying photoreceptors (fovea, cones only; perifovea, highest rod density). This systematic analysis provides further insight into RPE cell and granule physiology and links granule load to cell autofluorescence, providing a subcellular basis for the interpretation of clinical fundus autofluorescence."

SAXS provides overall parameters and low resolution shapes of solubilized MPs, but is also meaningfully employed in hybrid modeling procedures that combine scattering data with information provided by high-resolution techniques (eg. macromolecular crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy). Structural modeling of MPs from SAXS data is non-trivial, and the necessary computational procedures require further formalization and facilitation. We propose an automated pipeline integrated with the laboratory-information management system ISPyB, aimed at preliminary SAXS analysis and the first-step reconstruction of MPs in detergent solutions, in order to streamline high-throughput studies, especially at synchrotron beamlines. The pipeline queries an ISPyB database for available a priori information via dedicated services, estimates model-free SAXS parameters and generates preliminary models utilizing either ab initio, high-resolution-based, or mixed/hybrid methods. The results of the automated analysis can be inspected online using the standard ISPyB interface and the estimated modeling parameters may be utilized for further in-depth modeling beyond the pipeline. Examples of the pipeline results for the modelling of the tetrameric alpha-helical membrane channel Aquaporin0 and mechanosensitive channel T2, solubilized by n-Dodecyl beta-D-maltoside are presented. We demonstrate how increasing the amount of a priori information improves model resolution and enables deeper insights into the molecular structure of protein-detergent complexes."

OBJECTIVE: To identify hemodynamic features of TWRs of aneurysms by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses of unruptured middle cerebral artery bifurcation (MCAB) aneurysms. METHODS: Nine patients with 11 MCAB aneurysms were enrolled, and their TWRs were identified. CFD analysis was performed using 3 parameters: pressure, wall shear stress (WSS), and WSS divergence (WSSD). Each parameter was evaluated for its correspondence with TWR. RESULTS: Among 11 aneurysms, 15 TWRs were identified. Corresponding matches with CFD parameters (pressure, WSS, and WSSD) were 73.33, 46.67, and 86.67%, respectively. CONCLUSION: WSSD, a hemodynamic parameter that accounts for both magnitude and directionality of WSS, showed the highest correspondence. High WSSD might correspond with TWR of intracranial aneurysms, which are likely high-risk areas for rupture."

Simulations of backscattering media containing periodic and quasi-periodic scatterers were carried out to test the developed algorithm. Experimental data from HT-29 pellets and in vivo PC3 tumors were then used to estimate the mean scatterer spacing. For simulated media containing quasi-periodic scatterers at 1-mm and 100- [Formula: see text] spacing with 5% positional variation, the developed algorithm yielded a spacing estimation error of ~1% for 25- and 55-MHz US pulses. The mean scatterer spacing of HT-29 cell pellets (31.97 [Formula: see text]) was within 3% of the spacing obtained from histology and agreed with the predicted spacing from simulations based on the same pellets for both frequencies. The agreement extended to in vivo PC3 tumors estimation of the spacing with a variance of 1.68% between the spacing derived from the tumor histology and the application of the CWT to the experimental results. The developed technique outperformed the traditional cepstral methods as it can detect nonprominent peaks from quasi-random scatterer configurations. This work can be potentially used to detect morphological tissue changes during normal development or disease treatment."

Epub 2020 Feb 14.,Prade VM,Mol Metab,2020,2020/04/12,PMC7149754,,10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.017,"BACKGROUND: Imaging mass spectrometry enables in situ label-free detection of thousands of metabolites from intact tissue samples. However, automated steps for multi-omics analyses and interpretation of histological images have not yet been implemented in mass spectrometry data analysis workflows. The characterization of molecular properties within cellular and histological features is done via time-consuming, non-objective, and irreproducible definitions of regions of interest, which are often accompanied by a loss of spatial resolution due to mass spectra averaging. METHODS: We developed a new imaging pipeline called Spatial Correlation Image Analysis (SPACiAL), which is a computational multimodal workflow designed to combine molecular imaging data with multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC). SPACiAL allows comprehensive and spatially resolved in situ correlation analyses on a cellular resolution. To demonstrate the method, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) imaging mass spectrometry of metabolites and multiplex IHC staining were performed on the very same tissue section of mouse pancreatic islets and on human gastric cancer tissue specimens. The SPACiAL pipeline was used to perform an automatic, semantic-based, functional tissue annotation of histological and cellular features to identify metabolic profiles. Spatial correlation networks were generated to analyze metabolic heterogeneity associated with cellular features. RESULTS: To demonstrate the new method, the SPACiAL pipeline was used to identify metabolic signatures of alpha and beta cells within islets of Langerhans, which are cell types that are not distinguishable via morphology alone. The semantic-based, functional tissue annotation allows an unprecedented analysis of metabolic heterogeneity via the generation of spatial correlation networks. Additionally, we demonstrated intra- and intertumoral metabolic heterogeneity within HER2/neu-positive and -negative gastric tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: We developed the SPACiAL workflow to provide IHC-guided in situ metabolomics on intact tissue sections. Diminishing the workload by automated recognition of histological and functional features, the pipeline allows comprehensive analyses of metabolic heterogeneity. The multimodality of immunohistochemical staining and extensive molecular information from imaging mass spectrometry has the advantage of increasing both the efficiency and precision for spatially resolved analyses of specific cell types. The SPACiAL method is a stepping stone for the objective analysis of high-throughput, multi-omics data from clinical research and practice that is required for diagnostics, biomarker discovery, or therapy response prediction."

The contrast between thalamic nuclei as well as between the thalamus and surrounding tissues is poor in T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), inhibiting efforts to date to segment the thalamus using standard clinical MRI. Automatic parcellation techniques have been developed to leverage thalamic features better captured by advanced MRI methods, including magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). Despite operating on fundamentally different image contrasts, these methods claim a high degree of agreement with the Morel stereotactic atlas of the thalamus. However, no comparison has been undertaken to compare the results of these disparate parcellation methods. We have implemented state-of-the-art structural-, diffusion-, and functional imaging-based thalamus parcellation techniques and used them on a single set of subjects. We present the first systematic qualitative and quantitative comparison of these methods. The results show that DTI parcellation agrees more with structural parcellation in the larger thalamic nuclei, while rsfMRI parcellation agrees more with structural parcellation in the smaller nuclei. Structural parcellation is the most accurate in the delineation of small structures such as the habenular, antero-ventral, and medial geniculate nuclei."

However, voxel-based morphometry is rarely used for individual subjects because of high rates of false-positives. We investigated whether an approach with high dimensional warping to the template and nonparametric statistics would be useful to detect hippocampal atrophy in patients with hippocampal sclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed single-subject voxel-based morphometry with nonparametric statistics within the framework of Statistical Parametric Mapping to compare MRI from 26 well-characterized patients with temporal lobe epilepsy individually against a group of 110 healthy controls. The following statistical threshold was used: P < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons with family-wise error over the region of interest right and left hippocampus. RESULTS: The sensitivity for the detection of atrophy related to hippocampal sclerosis was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.67-0.99) for the right hippocampus and 0.60 (0.31-0.83) for the left, and the specificity for volume changes was 0.98 (0.93-0.99). All clusters of decreased hippocampal volumes were correctly lateralized to the seizure focus. Hippocampal volume decrease was in accordance with neuronal cell loss on histology reports. CONCLUSIONS: Nonparametric voxel-based morphometry is sensitive and specific for hippocampal atrophy in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and may be useful in clinical practice."

We have generated nucleus segmentation results in 5,060 Whole Slide Tissue images from 10 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. One key component of our work is that we carried out a multi-level quality control process (WSI-level and image patch-level), to evaluate the quality of our segmentation results. The image patch-level quality control used manual segmentation ground truth data from 1,356 sampled image patches. The datasets we publish in this work consist of roughly 5 billion quality controlled nuclei from more than 5,060 TCGA WSIs from 10 different TCGA cancer types and 1,356 manually segmented TCGA image patches from the same 10 cancer types plus additional 4 cancer types."

EIN was objectively defined previously as a regression model incorporating manually traced histologic variables to predict clonal growth and cancer outcomes. Results from this early computational study were used to revise subjective endometrial precancer diagnostic criteria currently in use. We here use automated feature segmentation and updated machine learning algorithms to develop a new classification algorithm. Endometrial tissue from 148 patients was randomly separated into 72-patient training and 76-patient validation cohorts encompassing all 3 diagnostic classes. We applied image analysis software to keratin stained endometrial tissues to automatically segment whole-slide digital images into epithelium, cells, and nuclei and extract corresponding variables. A total of 1413 variables were culled to 75 based on random forest classification performance in a 3-group (NL, EIN, EMCA) model. This algorithm correctly classifies cases with 3-class error rates of 0.04 (training set) and 0.058 (validation set); and 2-class (NL vs. EIN+EMCA) error rate of 0.016 (training set) and 0 (validation set). The 4 most heavily weighted variables are surrogates of those previously identified in manual-segmentation machine learning studies (stromal and epithelial area percentages, and normalized epithelial surface lengths). Lesser weighted predictors include gland and lumen axis lengths and ratios, and individual cell measures. Automated image analysis and random forest classification algorithms can classify normal, premalignant, and malignant endometrial tissues. Highest predictive variables overlap with those discovered independently in early models based on manual segmentation."

We have reported the feasibility of 5-ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence for detecting lymph node (LN) metastasis in gastrointestinal malignancies. However, a major barrier to the fluorescence diagnosis has been that the evaluation has been highly dependent on the observers. In this study, we examined the validity of a developed device for automated detection without subjectivity. METHODS: Gastric cancer patients who received oral administration of 5-ALA (20 mg/kg) prior to surgery were enrolled. For a total of 323 LNs obtained from 64 patients, the diagnostic results of the device were compared to those of conventional histopathological examination based on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained slides. The accuracy with the device was compared to that of stereoscopic detection with conventional fluorescence microscopy for 211 LNs from 42 patients. We used two types of image processing that we previously developed to eliminate autofluorescence of background tissues: differential and ratio methods. RESULTS: For detection of metastasis in 323 LNs, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves with the differential method and ratio method were 0.921 and 0.909, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy with the differential method were 78.0%, 96.8%, and 94.4%; while those with the ratio method were 78.0%, 96.1%, and 93.8%, respectively. In 211 LN analysis, the diagnostic accuracy with the device was comparable to that of stereoscopic examination. CONCLUSION: Our device for automated detection of LN metastasis using 5-ALA can be a useful tool for intraoperative diagnosis."

HCBF imaging delivers precise cell growth data and is completely label free rendering it an attractive alternative to common cell counting procedures that often adversely affect cell growth. With computational image analysis, HCBF achieves efficient high-throughput automated workflows, extremely relevant for drug and chemical screens in pharmaceutical, toxicological, and biomedical research. We demonstrate the applicability of HCBF microscopy to count three common cell types (HEK293, Huh7, and primary human dermal fibroblasts) with diverse morphology challenging the method. The three cell types required different analysis settings, and we identified two parameters of the computational image analysis, which after cell-specific optimization significantly improved the cell counting accuracy, namely the lower size limit and the intensity threshold. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging approaches, which have obtained great attention in recent years, were an interesting prospect to combine with HCBF microscopy. We optimized the analysis of two 3D outputs but found 3D HCBF imaging to be inferior to the optimized single-layer HCBF imaging for cell counting. HCBF cell counts were highly linearly correlated with (R(2) > 0.99) and highly similar (<15% difference) to cell counts obtained through Hoechst staining, over a broad range of densities allowing at least this level of accuracy for two to three cell generations in Huh7 cells and fibroblasts. Counts of HEK293 cells correlated somewhat less. In conclusion, the HCBF cell counting method is excellently suited for cell proliferation assays and cytotoxicity assays."

Microscopic analysis of blood smear by a hematologist is subjected to many challenges such as inter-observer variations, operator experience, and conditions of observation. This study aims to examine several parameters extracting from the features of blood smear images. These parameters were used to develop a predictive function, which can be used to automate the microscopic analysis of blood cells instead of manual observation. Fractal dimension, roundness, and aspect ratio were estimated for two types of abnormal erythrocytes: echinocyte and sickle cell. Standard conditions and the choosing of the optimum parameters through the imaging preprocessing were done in order to ensure that the chosen parameters reflect the morphological characteristics of examined erythrocytes. Statistical discriminant analysis was used to build the predictive function for erythrocytes morphological change by a linear combination of the measured parameters. The measured fractal dimensions were 1.825 +/-0.008, 1.502 +/-0.019 and 1.620 +/-0.018 for control, echinocyte, and sickle cell, respectively. The roundness values were 0.94 +/-0.05, 0.83 +/-0.04 and 0.56 +/-0.02 for control, echinocyte, and sickle cell, respectively. The aspect ratio values were 1.005 +/-0.151, 1.046 +/-0.089 and 1.742 +/-0.162 for control, echinocyte, and sickle cell, respectively. The differences between the image analysis parameters for echinocyte and sickle, when compared to control, were statistically significant. The constructed discriminant function using measured parameters was effectively differentiating between examined erythrocytes. The results demonstrated that the selected image analysis parameters extracted from microscopic images with conjunction with statistical discriminant analysis could be used as powerful tools in the classification of erythrocytes according to their morphological characteristics. The findings of this study, in addition to the previous attempts in this filed, could help in the enhancement of a fully automated microscopic system for blood smear analysis."

Indeed, in a considerable number of cases, Ta and T1 tumors look very similar under microscope, making the distinction very difficult even for experienced pathologists. Thus, there is an urgent need for a favoring system based on machine learning (ML) to distinguish between the two stages of bladder cancer. METHODS: A total of 1177 images of bladder tumor tissues stained by hematoxylin and eosin were collected by pathologists at University of Rochester Medical Center, which included 460 non-invasive (stage Ta) and 717 invasive (stage T1) tumors. Automatic pipelines were developed to extract features for three invasive patterns characteristic to the T1 stage bladder cancer (i.e., desmoplastic reaction, retraction artifact, and abundant pinker cytoplasm), using imaging processing software ImageJ and CellProfiler. Features extracted from the images were analyzed by a suite of machine learning approaches. RESULTS: We extracted nearly 700 features from the Ta and T1 tumor images. Unsupervised clustering analysis failed to distinguish hematoxylin and eosin images of Ta vs. T1 tumors. With a reduced set of features, we successfully distinguished 1177 Ta or T1 images with an accuracy of 91-96% by six supervised learning methods. By contrast, convolutional neural network (CNN) models that automatically extract features from images produced an accuracy of 84%, indicating that feature extraction driven by domain knowledge outperforms CNN-based automatic feature extraction. Further analysis revealed that desmoplastic reaction was more important than the other two patterns, and the number and size of nuclei of tumor cells were the most predictive features. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a ML-empowered, feature-centered, and interpretable diagnostic system to facilitate the accurate staging of Ta and T1 diseases, which has a potential to apply to other types of cancer."

METHODS: Review of CT angiograms (CTA) of 38 female patients was undertaken, by means of analysis of fine-cut axial images and three-dimensional image reconstructions of the cutaneous vasculature of the deep and superficial vasculature. In vivo dissection of the structure was also performed to establish its communications. Lastly, a histopathological analysis was carried out to investigate its intrinsic structure and function. RESULTS: The MAS was identified in both sides of the abdomen in all subjects and the diameter ranges from 0.72 to 2.81 mm with a median diameter of 1.28 mm. In vivo dissection revealed it as a distinct structure connecting the DIEA and SIEV. Pathological analysis showed that it has characteristics of both elastic and muscular arteries, which constitutes a new vessel. CONCLUSION: These further investigations have yielded a better understanding of the MAS shunt, its position, structure and function. This can be of crucial importance to reconstructive surgeons when raising the DIEP flap."

Chemical imaging technologies such as infrared, Raman, and mass spectrometry imaging, are powerful analytical techniques with a huge potential in describing the chemical composition of sample surfaces. In this work, three images of the same tissue slice using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, infrared microspectroscopy, and an RGB picture from a conventional hematoxylin/eosin (H/E) staining are simultaneously analyzed. These fused images were analyzed by multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), which provided, for each component, its distribution within the tissue surface, its IR spectrum fingerprint, its characteristic mass values, and the contribution of the RGB channels of the H/E staining. Compared with the individual analysis of each of the images alone, the fusion of the three images showed the relationship between the different types of chemical/biological information and enabled a better interpretation of the tissue under study. In addition, the least-squares projection of the MCR-ALS resolved spectra of components at low spatial resolution onto the IR and RBG images at high spatial resolution, provided a better delimitation of the sample constituents on the image, giving a more precise description of their distribution on the investigated tissue. The application of this procedure can be of interest in different research areas in which a good description of the spatial distribution of the chemical constituents of the samples is needed, such as in biomedicine, food, or environmental research."

Most Cell Painting studies have used the U-2 OS cell line for chemical or functional genomics screening. The Cell Painting assay can be used with many other human-derived cell types, given that the assay is based on the use of fluoroprobes that label organelles that are present in most (if not all) human cells. Questions remain, however, regarding the optimization steps required and overall ease of deployment of the Cell Painting assay to novel cell types. Here, we used the Cell Painting assay to characterize the phenotypic effects of 14 phenotypic reference chemicals in concentration-response screening mode across six biologically diverse human-derived cell lines (U-2 OS, MCF7, HepG2, A549, HTB-9 and ARPE-19). All cell lines were labeled using the same cytochemistry protocol, and the same set of phenotypic features was calculated. We found it necessary to optimize image acquisition settings and cell segmentation parameters for each cell type, but did not adjust the cytochemistry protocol. For some reference chemicals, similar subsets of phenotypic features corresponding to a particular organelle were associated with the highest-effect magnitudes in each affected cell type. Overall, for certain chemicals, the Cell Painting assay yielded qualitatively similar biological activity profiles among a group of diverse, morphologically distinct human-derived cell lines without the requirement for cell type-specific optimization of cytochemistry protocols."

This study analyzed topographic-anatomical patterns underlying neuroepithelial tumors, primary CNS lymphoma and metastases. METHODS: Any histologically confirmed supra- or infratentorial parenchymal neoplasia of one institution over a 4-year period was included. Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging data, a detailed analysis of the topographic-anatomical tumor features was performed. Differences between neuroepithelial tumors, primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and metastases were assessed using pairwise comparisons adjusted for multiple testing, upon significance of the omnibus test. RESULTS: Based on image analysis of 648 patients-419 (65%) neuroepithelial tumors, 28 (5%) PCNSL and 201 (31%) metastases-entity-specific topographic-anatomical patterns were identified. Neuroepithelial tumors showed a radial ventriculo-cortical orientation, inconsistent with the current belief of a growth along white matter tracts, whereas the pattern in PCNSL corresponded to a growth along such. Metastases preferentially affected the cortex and subcortical white matter of large arteries' terminal supply areas. This study provides a comprehensive anatomical description of the topography of NT, PCNSL and metastases intended to serve as a topographic reference for clinicians and neuroscientists. CONCLUSIONS: The identified distinct anatomical patterns provide evidence for a specific interaction between tumor and anatomical structures, following a pathoclitic concept. Understanding differences in their anatomical behavior has the potential to improve our pathophysiological understanding and to tailor therapy of brain tumors."

Five surplus PRF clots (2,700 RPM, 12 min.) donated by patients (63.6 +/- 12.3 years old) were prepared for use in dental clinical procedures. The internal three-dimensional morphology of the red zones and the thirds of the yellow zones of the clots were analyzed by Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (VPSEM) after sample preparation by two methods: 1. Fixation (2.5% gluataraldehyde); and 2. Fixation with subsequent partial removal of extracellular elements (8 N, HCl). Semi-quantitative elemental analysis was performed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). VPSEM analysis showed erythrocytes in both the red zone and the yellow zone, which consisted mainly of fibrin. Removal of extracellular elements enriched the morphology of both zones; the organization of the fibrin was observed to differ in the thirds of the yellow zone, with increasing density and organization to distal. The elements that compose organic substances (C-Carbon, N-Nitrogen, O-Oxygen, Na-Sodium and P-Phosphorus) and halogens (Cl-Chloride and S-Sulfur) were detected; the highest concentrations were of C, followed by O (p < 0.05), in the proximal region of the fibrin. The results of the present study suggest organization of fibrin in the PRF clot, and also reveal the distribution of the elements present in the different regions of the clot. Improved understanding of these characteristics may favor the use of this biomaterial by increasing its efficiency and functionality."

The design of segmentation methods that work independently of the tissue type or preparation is complex, due to variations in nuclear morphology, staining intensity, cell density and nuclei aggregations. Machine learning-based segmentation methods can overcome these challenges, however high quality expert-annotated images are required for training. Currently, the limited number of annotated fluorescence image datasets publicly available do not cover a broad range of tissues and preparations. We present a comprehensive, annotated dataset including tightly aggregated nuclei of multiple tissues for the training of machine learning-based nuclear segmentation algorithms. The proposed dataset covers sample preparation methods frequently used in quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate the heterogeneity of the dataset with respect to multiple parameters such as magnification, modality, signal-to-noise ratio and diagnosis. Based on a suggested split into training and test sets and additional single-nuclei expert annotations, machine learning-based image segmentation methods can be trained and evaluated."

Epub 2019 Apr 25.,Joshi S,Eur J Ophthalmol,2020,2019/04/26,,,10.1177/1120672119843021,"AIM: Fundus image analysis is the basis for the better understanding of retinal diseases which are found due to diabetes. Detection of earlier markers such as microaneurysms that appear in fundus images combined with treatment proves beneficial to prevent further complications of diabetic retinopathy with an increased risk of sight loss. METHODS: The proposed algorithm consists of three modules: (1) image enhancement through morphological processing; (2) the extraction and removal of red structures, such as blood vessels preceded by detection and removal of bright artefacts; (3) finally, the true microaneurysm candidate selection among other structures based on feature extraction set. RESULTS: The proposed strategy is successfully evaluated on two publicly available databases containing both normal and pathological images. The sensitivity of 89.22%, specificity of 91% and accuracy of 92% achieved for the detection of microaneurysms for Diaretdb1 database images. The algorithm evaluation for microaneurysm detection has a sensitivity of 83% and specificity 82% for e-ophtha database. CONCLUSION: In automated detection system, the successful detection of the number of microaneurysms correlates with the stages of the retinal diseases and its early diagnosis. The results for true microaneurysm detection indicates it as a useful tool for screening colour fundus images, which proves time saving for counting of microaneurysms to follow Diabetic Retinopathy Grading Criteria."

Epub 2020 Feb 6.,Lee H,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,2020,2020/02/07,,,10.1002/cyto.b.21871,"BACKGROUND: Many morphologic findings of histology can be translated into mathematically computerized data, and identifying important parameters is primarily pathologists' task as users. Shape-specific parameters based on computational geometry properties of glands can be used in the field of pathology. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of three shape-specific parameters: the chord intersection ratio, convexity ratio, and maximum concave area ratio for branching classification of glands. METHODS: Seven cases of tubular adenoma were studied. After image analysis, segmented neoplastic glands were classified into nonbranching, mild branching, and moderate branching. Using image analysis formulae for the three shape-specific parameters, we compared the values of the parameters with the branching classification results for colonic tubular adenoma. RESULTS: Multivariate discriminant analysis was used to classify the branching groups. Classification accuracies of nonbranching, mild branching, and moderate branching group based on the three shape-specific parameters were 98, 94, and 95%, respectively. More branching growth exhibited a higher chord intersection ratio and maximum concave area ratio but lower convexity ratio. We found a statistically significant difference in chord intersection ratio, maximum concave area ratio, and convexity ratio between mild, moderate, and nonbranching groups. Among the three features, the chord intersection ratio was the most significant parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Shape-based parameters of chord intersection ratio, convexity ratio, and maximum concave area ratio are valid assessment parameters for irregular branching structures. For the understanding of spatial relationships of histology, the holistic geometric approach using shape-based parameters can be useful."

Here, we aim to identify and verify its microstructural features and the potential value for differential diagnosis. MATERIALS: We investigated the dry preparation of the lumbar vertebrae and pelvic ring of a purported case of actinomycosis documented by a post-mortem examination in 1891. METHODS: Macroscopic inspection, conventional radiology, muCT, 3D reconstruction, and histological examination were employed. RESULTS: All approaches revealed new periosteal bone deposition with increased vascularisation of the os coxa, vertebrae, and sacrum. The muCT revealed cortical loss underneath the new bone formation; the 3D reconstruction and histological examination revealed plexiform bone and granular structures. CONCLUSIONS: The plexiform bone is the result of reactive rapid growth and remodelling processes, and is consistent with pathomorphological findings summarised in the autopsy report (soft tissue abscesses and formation of fistulas caused by ""Actinomycosis intestine et ossis ilei sin.""). SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first case of a historically documented case of actinomycosis infection investigated by muCT and histology. Different degrees of tissue damage and inflammatory reaction in form of plexiform bone, which has not been reported previously, was identified. LIMITATIONS: The noted bone tissue modifications are not solely pathognomic of actinomycosis; they characterise other diseases, as well. Histological evaluation is not appropriate for identifying the aetiology of the granular structures observed here; but clinically such aggregations appear in tissue affected by actinomycosis. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Histochemical and molecular-genetic analyses are obligatory to affirm the diagnosis based on micromorphological features."

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,Jin L,Microsc Res Tech,2020,2020/04/24,,,10.1002/jemt.23496,"With the development of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, complex dynamic processes in living cells can be observed and recorded with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. Single particle tracking (SPT) is the most important step to explore the relationship between the spatio-temporal dynamics of subcellular molecules and their functions. Although previous studies have developed SPT algorithms to quantitatively analyze particle dynamics in cell, traditional tracking methods have poor performance when dealing with intersecting trajectories. This can be attributed to two main reasons: (a) they do not have point compensation process for overlapping objects; (b) they use inefficient motion prediction models. In this paper, we present a novel fan-shaped tracker (FsT) algorithm to reconstruct the trajectories of subcellular vesicles in living cells. We proposed a customized point compensation method for overlapping objects based on the fan-shaped motion trend of the particles. Furthermore, we validated the performance of the FsT in both simulated time-lapse movies with variable imaging quality and in real vesicle moving images. Meanwhile, we compared the performance of FsT with other five state-of-the-art tracking algorithms by using commonly defined measures. The results showed that our FsT achieves better performance in high signal-to-noise ratio conditions and in tracking of overlapping objects. We anticipate that our FsT method will have vast applications in tracking of moving objects in cell."

Different aspects of its organization have been revealed by studies probing its different neurobiological properties. In particular, histological work has shown a pattern of differentiation along the proximal-distal dimension, while studies examining functional properties and large-scale functional integration have primarily highlighted a pattern of differentiation along the anterior-posterior dimension. To better understand how these organizational dimensions underlie the pattern of structural covariance (SC) in the human hippocampus, we here applied a non-linear decomposition approach, disentangling the major modes of variation, to the pattern of gray matter volume correlation of hippocampus voxels with the rest of the brain in a sample of 377 healthy young adults. We additionally investigated the consistency of the derived gradients in an independent sample of life-span adults and also examined the relationships between these major modes of variations and the patterns derived from microstructure and functional connectivity mapping. Our results showed that similar major modes of SC-variability are identified across the two independent datasets. The major dimension of variation found in SC runs along the hippocampal anterior-posterior axis and followed closely the principal dimension of functional differentiation, suggesting an influence of network level interaction in this major mode of morphological variability. The second main mode of variability in the SC showed a gradient along the dorsal-ventral axis, and was moderately related to variability in hippocampal microstructural properties. Thus our results depicting relatively reliable patterns of SC-variability within the hippocampus show an interplay between the already known organizational principles on the pattern of variability in hippocampus' macrostructural properties. This study hence provides a first insight on the underlying organizational forces generating different co-plastic modes within the human hippocampus that may, in turn, help to better understand different vulnerability patterns of this crucial structure in different neurological and psychiatric diseases."

The mitotic count provides an estimate of aggressiveness of the tumor. The detection of mitosis is a challenging task because in a frame of slides at X40 magnification, there are hundreds of nuclei containing few mitotic nuclei. However, manual counting of mitosis by pathologists is a difficult and time intensive job, moreover conventional method rely mainly on the shape, color, and/or texture features as well as pathologist experience. The objective of this study is to accept the atypaia-2014 mitosis detection challenge, automate the process of mitosis detection and a proposal of a hybrid feature space that provides better discrimination of mitotic and non-mitotic nuclei by combining color features with morphological and texture features. To exploit color channels, they were first selected, and then normalized and cumulative histograms were computed in wavelet domain. A detailed analysis presented on these features in different color channels of respective color spaces using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The proposed hybrid feature space when used with SVM classifier achieved a detection rate of 78.88% and F-measure of 72.07%. Our results, especially high detection rate, indicate that proposed hybrid feature space model contains discriminant information for mitotic nuclei, being therefore a very capable are for exploration to improve the quality of the diagnostic assistance in histopathology."

However, some aspects of the analysis such as invasiveness, evaluation range, and turnaround time from biopsy to report could be improved. Here, we report a novel method for visualizing human cervical tissue three-dimensionally, without biopsy, fixation, or staining, and with sufficient quality for histologic diagnosis. Near-infrared excitation and nonlinear optics were employed to visualize unstained human epithelial tissues of the cervix uteri by constructing images with third-harmonic generation (THG) and second-harmonic generation (SHG). THG images enabled evaluation of nuclear morphology in a quantitative manner with six parameters after image analysis using deep learning. It was also possible to quantitatively assess intraepithelial fibrotic changes based on SHG images and another deep learning analysis. Using each analytical procedure alone, normal and cancerous tissue were classified quantitatively with an AUC >/=0.92. Moreover, a combinatory analysis of THG and SHG images with a machine learning algorithm allowed accurate classification of three-dimensional image files of normal tissue, intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive carcinoma with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.86. Our method enables real-time noninvasive diagnosis of cervical lesions, thus constituting a potential tool to dramatically change early detection. SIGNIFICANCE: This study proposes a novel method for diagnosing cancer using nonlinear optics, which enables visualization of histologic features of living tissues without the need for any biopsy or staining dye."

Image analysis of histomorphometric measurements remains a time-consuming task, as the image analysis software currently available does not allow for automated image segmentation. Such a feature is usually obtained by machine learning and with software platforms that provide image-processing tools such as MATLAB. In this study, we introduce a new MATLAB algorithm to quantify immunohistochemically stained critical-sized bone defect samples and compare the results with the commonly available Aperio Image Scope Positive Pixel Count (PPC) algorithm. Bland and Altman analysis and Pearson correlation showed that the measurements acquired with the new MATLAB algorithm were in excellent agreement with the measurements obtained with the Aperio PPC algorithm, and no significant differences were found within the histomorphometric measurements. The ability to segment whole slide images, as well as defining the size and the number of regions of interest to be quantified, makes this MATLAB algorithm a potential histomorphometric tool for obtaining more objective, precise, and reproducible quantitative assessments of entire critical-sized bone defect image data sets in an efficient and manageable workflow."

To explore this structure-function relationship, it is necessary to directly visualize genomic elements in living cells. Genome imaging based on the CRISPR system is a powerful approach but has limited applicability due to background signals and nonspecific aggregation of fluorophores within nuclei. To address this issue, we developed a novel visualization scheme combining tripartite fluorescent proteins with the SunTag system and demonstrated that it strongly suppressed background fluorescence and amplified locus-specific signals, allowing long-term tracking of genomic loci. We integrated the multicomponent CRISPR system into stable cell lines to allow quantitative and reliable analysis of dynamic behaviors of genomic loci. Due to the greatly elevated signal-to-background ratio, target loci with only small numbers of sequence repeats could be successfully tracked, even under a conventional fluorescence microscope. This feature enables the application of CRISPR-based imaging to loci throughout the genome and opens up new possibilities for the study of nuclear processes in living cells."

Our purpose was to identify by FTIR imaging the spectral characteristics of hepatic fibrosis in cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. FTIR images were collected at projected pixel sizes of 25 and 2.7 mum from paraffinized hepatic tissues of five patients with uncomplicated cirrhosis and five cirrhotic patients with HCC and analyzed by k-means clustering. When compared to the adjacent histological section, the spectral clusters corresponding to hepatic fibrosis and regeneration nodules were easily identified. The fibrosis area estimated by FTIR imaging was correlated to that evaluated by digital image analysis of histological sections and was higher in patients with HCC compared to those without complications. Qualitative differences were also observed when fibrosis areas were specifically targeted at higher resolution. The partition in two clusters of the fibrosis tissue highlighted subtle differences in the spectral characteristics of the two groups of patients. These data show that the quantitative and qualitative changes of fibrosis tissue occurring during the course of cirrhosis are detectable by FTIR imaging, suggesting the possibility of subclassifying cirrhosis into different steps of severity."

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional cohort study of twenty children with celiac disease and 20 healthy controls who underwent clinical and laboratory assessments and corneal confocal microscopy. Corneal nerve fiber density (no.mm2), corneal nerve branch density (no.mm2), corneal nerve fiber length (mm.mm2), corneal nerve fiber tortuosity and inferior whorl length (mm.mm2) were quantified manually. RESULTS: Corneal nerve fiber density (34.7+/-8.6 vs. 32.9+/-8.6; P = 0.5), corneal nerve branch density (47.2+/-24.5 vs. 47.3+/-20.0; P = 0.1) and corneal nerve fiber length (20.0+/-5.1 vs. 19.5+/-4.5; P = 0.8) did not differ between children with celiac disease and healthy controls.

A liver biopsy is currently required to stratify high-risk patients, and predicting the degree of liver inflammation and fibrosis using non-invasive tests remains challenging. Here, we sought to develop a novel, cost-effective screening tool for NAFLD based on thermal imaging. We used a commercially available and non-invasive thermal camera and developed a new image processing algorithm to automatically predict disease status in a small animal model of fatty liver disease. To induce liver steatosis and inflammation, we fed C57/black female mice (8 weeks old) a methionine-choline deficient diet (MCD diet) for 6 weeks. We evaluated structural and functional liver changes by serial ultrasound studies, histopathological analysis, blood tests for liver enzymes and lipids, and measured liver inflammatory cell infiltration by flow cytometry. We developed an image processing algorithm that measures relative spatial thermal variation across the skin covering the liver. Thermal parameters including temperature variance, homogeneity levels and other textural features were fed as input to a t-SNE dimensionality reduction algorithm followed by k-means clustering. During weeks 3,4, and 5 of the experiment, our algorithm demonstrated a 100% detection rate and classified all mice correctly according to their disease status. Direct thermal imaging of the liver confirmed the presence of changes in surface thermography in diseased livers. We conclude that non-invasive thermal imaging combined with advanced image processing and machine learning-based analysis successfully correlates surface thermography with liver steatosis and inflammation in mice. Future development of this screening tool may improve our ability to study, diagnose and treat liver disease."

The extraction sites were randomly selected to receive either the PBM therapy with a CW GaAIAs diode laser (808 nm; 0.028 mm(2); 0.1 W; 3.6 W/cm(2); 89 J/cm(2); 2.5 J/point) or no treatment (Control). Bone biopsies were harvested 45 days after the dental extraction and evaluated using micro-computerized tomography (muCT), morphometric, and histological analysis. Data were compared using the paired t test, and the level of significance was set at 5%. Bone surface (p = 0.029), bone surface/total volume (p = 0.028), trabecular number (p = 0.025), and connectivity density (p = 0.029) were higher at the PBM group compared with Control. The histological observations confirmed the muCT findings. PBM samples exhibited higher number of organized and connected bone trabeculae along with higher density of blood vessels than Control. Control samples displayed a dense and highly cellular connective tissue at the central area accompanied by the presence of immature bone trabeculae at the periphery. Our results indicated that the PBM therapy improved the newly bone trabeculae formation and their connectivity which increased bone surface, indicating the positive effect of the laser on alveolar human socket repair."

It is caused by mutations of the ABCC6 gene that leads to decreased serum levels of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) anti-mineralization factor. The occurrence of severe complications among PXE patients highlights the importance of early diagnosis so that prompt multidisciplinary care can be provided to patients. We aimed to examine dermal connective tissue with nonlinear optical (NLO) techniques, as collagen emits second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal, while elastin can be excited by two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPF). We performed molecular genetic analysis, ophthalmological and cardiovascular assessment, plasma PPi measurement, conventional histopathological examination, and ex vivo SHG and TPF imaging in five patients with PXE and five age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Pathological mutations including one new variant were found in the ABCC6 gene in all PXE patients and their plasma PPi level was significantly lower compared with controls. Degradation and mineralization of elastin fibers and extensive calcium deposition in the mid-dermis was visualized and quantified together with the alterations of the collagen structure in PXE. Our data suggests that NLO provides high-resolution imaging of the specific histopathological features of PXE-affected skin. In vivo NLO may be a promising tool in the assessment of PXE, promoting early diagnosis and follow-up."

Epub 2020 May 22.,Braiki M,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2020,2020/06/05,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105520,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, the number of pathologies related to food are multiplied. Mycotoxins are one of the most severe food contaminants that cause serious effects on the human health. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an assessment tool for evaluating their impact on the immune response. Recently, a new investigational method using human dendritic cells was endorsed by biologists. Nevertheless, analysis of the morphological features and the behavior of these cells remains merely visual. In addition, this manual analysis is difficult and time-consuming. Here, we focus mainly on automating the evaluation process by using advanced image processing technology. METHODS: An automatic segmentation approach of microscopic dendritic cell images is developed to provide a fast and objective evaluation. First, a combination of K-means clustering and mathematical morphology is used to detect dendritic cells. Second, a region-based Chan-Vese active contour model is used to segment the detected cells more precisely. Finally, dendritic cells are extracted by a filtering based on eccentricity measure. RESULTS: The proposed scheme is tested on an actual dataset containing 421 microscopic dendritic cell images. The experimental results show high conformity between the results of the proposed scheme and ground-truth elaborated by biological expert. Moreover, a comparative study with other state-of-art segmentation schemes demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method. It gives the highest average accuracy rate (99.42 %) compared to recent studied approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed image segmentation method for morphological analysis of dendrite inhibition can consistently be used as an assessment tool for biologists to facilitate the evaluation of serious health impacts of mycotoxins."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the sonographic images of 1656 consecutive patients who had undergone thyroidectomy in 2017. The diagnostic performance of sonographic features suggestive of ETE was evaluated using operation and histopathologic reports. Sonographic features for gross ETE to the strap muscle and minor ETE were assessed for thyroid cancer abutting the anterolateral thyroid capsule. Sonographic features for tracheal invasion were assessed according to whether the angle between the tumor and the trachea was an acute, right, or obtuse angle. Sonographic features for recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) invasion were assessed based on the association between the tumor and tracheoesophageal groove (TEG) as preserved normal tissue, abutting or protruding into the TEG. RESULTS: ETE was observed in 783 patients (47.3%), including 123 patients with gross ETE (7.4% [strap muscle, n = 97; RLN, n = 24; and trachea, n = 14]) and 660 patients with minor ETE (39.9%). Regarding the diagnosis of gross and minor ETE to the strap muscle, sonographic features of replacement of the strap muscle and capsular disruption showed the highest positive predictive value (75.9% and 58.5%, respectively). Thyroid cancer forming an obtuse angle with the trachea had the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of tracheal invasion (85.7%), and thyroid cancer protrusion into the TEG showed the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of RLN (83.3%). CONCLUSION: Sonography is considered beneficial in the diagnosis of ETE to the strap muscle, trachea, and RLN. Assessment of ETE is important for the accurate staging of thyroid cancer, which in turn determines the extent of surgery or whether active surveillance is appropriate or not."

This paper proposes Geometry-inspired Chemical-invariant and Tissue Invariant Stain Normalization method, namely GCTI-SN, for microscopic medical images. The proposed GCTI-SN method corrects for illumination variation, stain chemical, and stain quantity variation in a unified framework by exploiting the underlying color vector space's geometry. While existing stain normalization methods have demonstrated their results on a single tissue and stain type, GCTI-SN is benchmarked on three cancer datasets of three cell/tissue types prepared with two different stain chemicals. GCTI-SN method is also benchmarked against the existing methods via quantitative and qualitative results, validating its robustness for stain chemical and cell/tissue type. Further, the utility and the efficacy of the proposed GCTI-SN stain normalization method is demonstrated diagnostically in the application of breast cancer detection via a CNN-based classifier."

It is also common on the microscopic level, where symmetry is often key to the proper function of core biological processes. The human brain is exquisitely well suited to recognize such symmetrical features with ease. In contrast, computational recognition of such patterns in images is still surprisingly challenging. In this paper we describe a mathematical approach to identifying smaller local symmetrical structures within larger images. Our algorithm attributes a local symmetry score to each image pixel, which subsequently allows the identification of the symmetrical centers of an object. Though there are already many methods available to detect symmetry in images, to the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first that is easily applicable in ImageJ/FIJI. We have created an interactive plugin in FIJI that allows the detection and thresholding of local symmetry values. The plugin combines the different reflection symmetry axis of a square to get a good coverage of reflection symmetry in all directions. To demonstrate the plugins potential, we analyzed images of bacterial chemoreceptor arrays and intracellular vesicle trafficking events, which are two prominent examples of biological systems with symmetrical patterns."

It is mainly oriented to work with histology slides but also includes a significant part of modern image formats. Introducing Pathadin, the manuscript aims to improve understanding of contemporary image analysis components, resolve technophobia and misbeliefs in the computational field, simplifying pathology research work, and shifting it into a quantitative paradigm. Despite being easy to use, Pathadin includes both basic and advanced analytical algorithms, as the application of machine learning. The functionality of Pathadin is demonstrated by AI-enhanced quantification of epithelial and stromal changes in prostate carcinoma, and their dependence on ISUP grade. The material included 5 radical prostatectomy samples for training and 83 (including 11 autopsies) samples for analysis. The analytical material was stained with Masson's trichrome and Ki67, as widely available and potentially prognostic markers. An integrated solution by HistomicsTK for Ki67 evaluation was used. A U-net model for separating glands and stroma was trained, simplifying the independent analysis of these components. During the process, the model successfully highlighted glands and stroma. Masson's trichrome stain demonstrated a gradual increase in collagen expression, being statistically significant between controls vs. G1, and G3 vs. G4. Although there was considerable overlap between adjacent groups, there was only a minor overlap in collagen amount between high- and low-grade carcinomas, affirming that with further research, stroma could be an additional diagnostic marker in prostate adenocarcinoma. Ki67 showed a statistically significant gradual increase in all groups except G1 vs. G2 and G4 vs. G5. Pathadin demonstrates that there is no need for significant resources to experience the advantages of modern computer-assisted analysis."

A thorough characterization of minipig skin is essential for gaining deeper understanding of its structural and functional similarities with human skin. In this study, three-dimensional (3-D) in vivo images of minipig skin was obtained non-invasively using a multimodal optical imaging system capable of acquiring two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) images simultaneously. The images of the structural features of different layers of the minipig skin were qualitatively and quantitatively compared with those of human skin. Label-free imaging of skin was possible due to the endogenous fluorescence and optical properties of various components in the skin such as keratin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H), melanin, elastin, and collagen. This study demonstrates the capability of optical biopsy techniques, such as TPEF and FLIM, for in vivo non-invasive characterization of cellular and functional features of minipig skin, and the optical image-based similarities of this commonly utilized model of human skin. These optical imaging techniques have the potential to become promising tools in dermatological research for developing a better understanding of animal skin models, and for aiding in translational pre-clinical to clinical studies."

Despite the advent of revolutionary methods of image analysis and high resolution three-dimensional imaging technology, basic conventional light microscopy still provides an incisive overview of the structure and tissue dynamics of the musculoskeletal system. This is crucial to both preclinical and clinical research, since several clinically relevant processes, such as bone repair, osteoarthritis, and metabolic bone diseases, display distinct, if not pathognomonic, histological features. Due to the particular characteristics of the skeletal tissues (i.e., the existence of mineralized extracellular matrices), a large number of staining methods applicable to either decalcified or undecalcified tissues are available. However, it is usually the case that several staining methods need to be sequentially applied in order to achieve the different endpoints required to fully assess skeletal tissue structure and dynamics, and to allow morphometric quantification. We describe herein a novel staining method, the RGB trichrome, amenable for application to decalcified, paraffin embedded human musculoskeletal tissues. The acronym RGB corresponds to the three primary dyes used: picrosirius Red, fast Green, and alcian Blue. Although these individual pigments are commonly used either isolated, in binary combinations, or as part of more complex polychrome staining methods, when merged in the RGB trichrome staining produce high-quality/high-contrast images, permitting not only clear identification of different tissues (i.e., the different types of cartilage, bone and fibrous connective tissue), but also discrimination between calcified and uncalcified bone and cartilage, as well as an unexpected diversity of shades of color, while displaying singular properties among polychrome staining methods, such as the unveiling of the bone osteocyte dendritic/canalicular network. Hence, we propose the RGB trichrome as simple but highly-reliable tool for the preclinical and clinical study of the musculoskeletal system."

We introduce computer-based image segmentation and life stage classification with a random forest classifier. Segmentation and stage classification are performed on a large dataset of malaria parasites with ground truth labels provided by experts. METHODS: We made use of Giemsa stained images obtained from the blood of 16 patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Experts labeled the parasite types from each of the images. We applied a two-step approach: image segmentation followed by life stage classification. In segmentation, we classified each pixel as a parasite or non-parasite pixel using a random forest classifier. Performance was evaluated with classification accuracy, Dice coefficient and free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis. In life stage classification, we classified each of the segmented objects into one of 8 classes: 6 parasite life stages, early ring, late ring or early trophozoite, mid trophozoite, early schizont, late schizont or segmented, and two other classes, white blood cell or debris. RESULTS: Our segmentation method gives an average cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.82 which is a 13% improvement compared to the Otsu method. The Otsu method achieved a True Positive Fraction (TPF) of 0.925 at the expense of a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 2.45. At the same TPF of 0.925, our method achieved an FPR of 0.92, an improvement by more than a factor two. We find that inclusion of average intensity of the whole image as feature for the random forest considerably improves segmentation performance. We obtain an overall accuracy of 58.8% when classifying all life stages. Stages are mostly confused with their neighboring stages. When we reduce the life stages to ring, trophozoite and schizont only, we obtain an accuracy of 82.7%. CONCLUSION: Pixel classification gives better segmentation performance than the conventional Otsu method. Effects of staining and background variations can be reduced with the inclusion of average intensity features. The proposed method and data set can be used in the development of automatic tools for the detection and stage classification of malaria parasites. The data set is publicly available as a benchmark for future studies."

A large number of cervix images acquired by the commercial MobileODT EVA system were filtered for acceptable visual quality and then 7587 filtered images from 3221 women were annotated by a group of gynecologic oncologists (so the gold standard is an expert impression, not histopathology). We tested and analyzed on multiple random splits of the images using two deep learning, object detection networks. For all the receiver operating characteristics curves, the area under the curve values for the discrimination of the most likely precancer cases from least likely cases (most likely controls) were above 0.90. These results showed that AVE can classify cervix images with confidence scores that are strongly associated with expert evaluations of severity for the same images. The results on a small subset of images that have histopathologic diagnoses further supported the capability of AVE for predicting cervical precancer. We examined the associations of AVE severity score with gynecologic oncologist impression at all regions where we had a sufficient number of cases and controls, and the influence of a woman's age. The method was found generally resilient to regional variation in the appearance of the cervix. This work suggests that using AVE on smartphones could be a useful adjunct to health-worker visual assessment with acetic acid, a cervical cancer screening method commonly used in low- and middle-resource settings."

To map microstructure-specific magnetic susceptibility in orientationally heterogeneous material, it is thus imperative to regress out unwanted orientation effects. METHODS: This work introduces a novel framework, referred to as microscopic susceptibility anisotropy imaging, that disentangles the 2 principal effects conflated in gradient-echo measurements, (a) the susceptibility properties of tissue microenvironments, especially the myelin microstructure, and (b) the axon orientation distribution relative to the magnetic field. Specifically, we utilize information about the orientational tissue structure inferred from diffusion MRI data to factor out the B0 -direction dependence of the frequency difference signal. RESULTS: A human pilot study at 3 T demonstrates proxy maps of microscopic susceptibility anisotropy unconfounded by fiber crossings and orientation dispersion as well as magnetic field direction. The developed technique requires only a dual-echo gradient-echo scan acquired at 1 or 2 head orientations with respect to the magnetic field and a 2-shell diffusion protocol achievable on standard scanners within practical scan times. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative recovery of microscopic susceptibility features in the presence of orientational heterogeneity potentially improves the assessment of microstructural tissue integrity."

These multiphoton-based tools allowed evidencing retinoids epidermal effects in the occlusive patch test protocol developed for antiaging products screening. This study aimed at investigating their relevance for non-invasive, time course assessment of retinoids cutaneous effects under real-life conditions for one year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty women, 55-65 y, applied either retinol (RO 0.3%) or retinoic acid (RA 0.025%) on one forearm dorsal side versus a control product on the other forearm once a day for 1 year. In vivo multiphoton imaging was performed every three months, and biopsies were taken after 1 year. Epidermal thickness and dermal-epidermal junction undulation were estimated in 3D with multiphoton and in 2D with histology, whereas global melanin density and its z-epidermal distribution were estimated using 3D multiphoton image processing tools. RESULTS: Main results after one year were as follows: a) epidermal thickening with RO (+30%); b) slight increase in dermal-epidermal junction undulation with RO; c) slight decrease in 3D melanin density with RA; d) limitation of the melanin ascent observed with seasonality and time within supra-basal layers with both retinoids, using multiphoton 3D-melanin z-epidermal profile. CONCLUSIONS: With a novel 3D descriptor of melanin z-epidermal distribution, in vivo multiphoton imaging allows demonstrating that daily usage of retinoids counteracts aging by acting not only on epidermal morphology, but also on melanin that is shown to accumulate in the supra-basal layers with time."

In this work, we adopt a deep learning based semantic segmentation framework to solve the RBC classification task. A major challenge for robust segmentation and classification is the large variations on the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells, combining with the low image quality caused by noise and artifacts. To address these challenges, we apply deformable convolution layers to the classic U-Net structure and implement the deformable U-Net (dU-Net). U-Net architecture has been shown to offer accurate localization for image semantic segmentation. Moreover, deformable convolution enables free-form deformation of the feature learning process, thus making the network more robust to various cell morphologies and image settings. dU-Net is tested on microscopic red blood cell images from patients with sickle cell disease. Results show that dU-Net can achieve highest accuracy for both binary segmentation and multi-class semantic segmentation tasks, comparing with both unsupervised and state-of-the-art deep learning based supervised segmentation methods. Through detailed investigation of the segmentation results, we further conclude that the performance improvement is mainly caused by the deformable convolution layer, which has better ability to separate the touching cells, discriminate the background noise and predict correct cell shapes without any shape priors."

The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic utility of first-order texture parameters derived from both whole tumor and single largest slice of T1-contrast enhanced (T1-CE) images in differentiating meningiomas with and without brain invasion based on histopathology demonstration. METHODS: T1-CE images of a total of 56 cases of grade II meningiomas with brain invasion (BI) and 52 meningiomas (37 grade I and 15 grade II) with no brain invasion (NBI) were analyzed. Filtration-based first-order histogram derived texture parameters were calculated both for whole tumor volume and largest axial cross-section. Random forest models were constructed both for whole tumor volume and largest axial cross-section individually and were assessed using a 5-fold cross validation with 100 repeats. RESULTS: In detection of brain invasion, random forest model based on whole tumor segmentation had an AUC of 0.988 (95 % CI 0.976-1.00) with a cross validated value of 0.74 (95 % CI 0.45-0.96). For differentiation of grade I meningiomas from grade II meningiomas with brain invasion, the AUC was 0.999 (95 % CI 0.995-1.00) and 0.81 (95 % CI 0.61-0.99) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Similarly, when using only the single largest slice, the cross-validated AUC to distinguish BI versus NBI and BI versus grade I meningiomas was 0.67 (95 % CI 0.47, 0.92 and 0.78 (95 % CI 0.52, 0.95) respectively. CONCLUSION: Radiomics based feature analysis applied on routine MRI post-contrast images may be helpful to predict presence of brain invasion in meningioma, possibly with better performance when comparing BI versus grade I meningiomas."

The gold standard of staging in oncology has been the TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) staging system. Though histopathological grading has shown prognostic significance, it is subjective and limited by interobserver variability even among experienced surgical pathologists. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been applied to pathology images toward diagnostic-, prognostic-, and treatment prediction-related tasks in cancer. AI approaches have the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional TNM staging and tumor grading approaches, providing a direct prognostic prediction of disease outcome independent of tumor stage and grade. Broadly speaking, these AI approaches involve extracting patterns from images that are then compared against previously defined disease signatures. These patterns are typically categorized as either (1) handcrafted, which involve domain-inspired attributes, such as nuclear shape, or (2) deep learning (DL)-based representations, which tend to be more abstract. DL approaches have particularly gained considerable popularity because of the minimal domain knowledge needed for training, mostly only requiring annotated examples corresponding to the categories of interest. In this article, we discuss AI approaches for digital pathology, especially as they relate to disease prognosis, prediction of genomic and molecular alterations in the tumor, and prediction of treatment response in oncology. We also discuss some of the potential challenges with validation, interpretability, and reimbursement that must be addressed before widespread clinical deployment. The article concludes with a brief discussion of potential future opportunities in the field of AI for digital pathology and oncology."

Since contrast enhancement has been widely used as an image preprocessing step for the analysis of histopathology images, a systematic comparison is made with six such prominently used methods, namely Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), RIQMC-based optimal histogram matching (ROHIM), modified L(0), Morphological Varying(MV)-Bitonic filter, unsharp mask filter and joint bilateral filter. The images enhanced using GF approach lead to better segmentation accuracy (upto 50% improvement over native images) and visual quality compared to other approaches, without any change in the color tones. Thus, the proposed GF approach is a viable solution for rectifying the OoF microscopy images without the loss of the valuable diagnostic information presented by the color tone."

Its study has been thwarted by difficulties in the accurate measurement of cell size and the even greater challenges of measuring growth of a single cell over time. We address these limitations by demonstrating a computationally enhanced methodology for quantitative phase microscopy for adherent cells, using improved image processing algorithms and automated cell-tracking software. Accuracy has been improved more than twofold and this improvement is sufficient to establish the dynamics of cell growth and adherence to simple growth laws. It is also sufficient to reveal unknown features of cell growth, previously unmeasurable. With these methodological and analytical improvements, in several cell lines we document a remarkable oscillation in growth rate, occurring throughout the cell cycle, coupled to cell division or birth yet independent of cell cycle progression. We expect that further exploration with this advanced tool will provide a better understanding of growth rate regulation in mammalian cells."

Leveraging an ultra-high-resolution histological reconstruction of a human brain, our study showed that the dominant axis of MTL cytoarchitectural differentiation follows the iso-to-allocortical transition and depth-specific variations in neuronal density. Projecting the histology-derived MTL model to in-vivo functional MRI, we furthermore determined how its cytoarchitecture underpins its intrinsic effective connectivity and association to large-scale networks. Here, the cytoarchitectural gradient was found to underpin intrinsic effective connectivity of the MTL, but patterns differed along the anterior-posterior axis. Moreover, while the iso-to-allocortical gradient parametrically represented the multiple-demand relative to task-negative networks, anterior-posterior gradients represented transmodal versus unimodal networks. Our findings establish that the combination of micro- and macrostructural features allow the MTL to represent dominant motifs of whole-brain functional organisation."

It is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue in extrauterine locations. The development of novel therapies and diagnostic tools for endometriosis has been limited due in part to challenges in studying the disease. Outside of primates, few mammals menstruate, and none develop spontaneous endometriosis. Rodent models are popular but require artificial induction of endometriosis, with many utilizing either immunocompromised mice or surgically induced disease. Recently, more attention has been given to models involving intraperitoneal injection. We present a murine model of endometriosis that integrates several features of existing endometriosis models into a novel, simplified system that relies on microscopic quantification in lieu of subjective grading. In this model, we perform hormonal stimulation of donor mice, intraperitoneal injection, systematic abdominal survey and tissue harvest, and histologic quantification that can be performed and verified at any time after necropsy. This model requires minimal resources and training; does not require expertise by lab technicians in murine survival surgery or in the identification of gross endometriotic lesions; can be used in immunocompromised, immunocompetent, and/or mutant mice; and reliably creates endometriotic lesions that are histologically consistent with human endometriotic disease."

This makes the visualization of such data a challenge, especially with specimens where small dim structures are equally important as large bright ones, or whenever variations in intensity, such as non-homogeneous staining efficiencies or light depth penetration, becomes an issue. While simple intensity display mappings are easily possible, these fail to provide a one-shot observation that can display objects of varying intensities. In order to facilitate the visualization-based analysis of large volumetric datasets, we developed an easy-to-use ImageJ plugin enabling the compressed display of features within several magnitudes of intensities. The Display Enhancement for Visual Inspection of Large Stacks plugin (DEVILS) homogenizes the intensities by using a combination of local and global pixel operations to allow for high and low intensities to be visible simultaneously to the human eye. The plugin is based on a single, intuitively understandable parameter, features a preview mode, and uses parallelization to process multiple image planes. As output, the plugin is capable of producing a BigDataViewer-compatible dataset for fast visualization. We demonstrate the utility of the plugin for large volumetric image data."

Epub 2020 Jun 9.,Depretto C,Tumori,2020,2020/06/10,,,10.1177/0300891620919170,"AIM: To evaluate the presence of contrast enhancement at the site of calcifications on contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and histopathologic results at vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB), and to examine the association with lesion size and immunohistochemical characteristics, in order to assess disease aggressiveness in malignant lesions. METHODS: A total of 34 patients with 36 clusters of suspicious calcifications (BI-RADS 4) were investigated with CEM before the scheduled VAB. We evaluated the presence or absence of enhancement, histologic diagnosis, and, in case of malignant lesions, their size and the expression of Ki-67. RESULTS: In our case series, 15/36 (41.7%) lesions were malignant. In 7 cases, contrast enhancement was found at the site of calcifications. Data about size of lesions and immunohistochemical characterization were not available for all malignant cases. In 5 cases with CEM enhancement, all lesions were >5 mm and overexpressing Ki-67 (>20%); in 6 cases with no contrast enhancement, the lesions were <5 mm and with low Ki-67 values (<20%). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary study provides indications on the ability of CEM to recognize neoplasms larger than 5 mm, with high proliferative index (Ki-67 >20%), and frequently human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive. Our preliminary results suggest that CEM could detect aggressive malignancies. This could be the starting point for planning further studies with larger numbers of cases, in an attempt to reduce overdiagnosis and consequent overtreatment."

METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with suspected NET liver metastases underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. Three radiologists read four imaging sets separately and independently: DWI, T2W+dynamic, T2WI+HBP, and DWI+HBP. Reference standard included all imaging, histological findings, and clinical data. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and compared for each imaging set. Interreader agreement was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Univariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate lesion characteristics (size, ADC, and enhancing pattern) associated to false positive and negative lesions. RESULTS: Six hundred twenty-five lesions (545 metastases, 80 benign lesions) were identified. Detection rate was significantly higher combining DWI+HBP than the other imaging sets (sensitivity 86% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.845-0.878), specificity 94% (95% CI 0.901-0.961)). The sensitivity and specificity of the other sets were 82% and 65% for DWI, 88% and 69% for T2WI, and 90% and 82% for HBP+T2WI, respectively. The interreader agreement was statistically higher for both HBP sets (ICC = 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97) for T2WI+HBP and ICC = 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) for DWI+HBP, respectively) compared with that for DWI (ICC = 0.76 (95% CI 0.66-0.83)) and T2+dynamic (ICC = 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.9)). High ADC values, large lesion size, and hypervascular pattern lowered the risk of false negative. CONCLUSION: Given the high diagnostic accuracy of combining DWI+HBP, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI is to be considered in NET patients with suspected liver metastases. Fast MRI protocol using T2WI, DWI, and HBP is of interest in this population. KEY POINTS: * The combined set of diffusion-weighted (DW) and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images yields the highest sensitivity and specificity for neuroendocrine liver metastasis (NELM) detection. * Gadoxetic acid should be the contrast agent of choice for liver MRI in NET patients. * The combined set of HBP and DWI sequences could also be used as a tool of abbreviated MRI in follow-up or assessment of treatment such as somatostatin analogs."

The software package is a user-friendly application that does not require a vast knowledge of computer science or costly commercial tools. AdipoGauge includes analysing tools that are capable of cell counting and colour separation. Furthermore, it can quantify the cell data in images both with and without clear boundaries around the cells. It can also remove objects from the image that are not intended for analysis, such as blood vessels or partial cells at edges of slide sections. The simple and state-of-the-art graphical user interface requires minimal time and learning."

METHODS: The UTE-QSM technique was based on three sets of dual-echo 3D UTE Cones data acquired with TEs of 0.032/2.8, 0.2/3.6, and 0.4/4.4 ms. The images were processed with iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation to estimate the B(0) field map in the presence of fat. Then, the projection onto dipole field (PDF) algorithm was applied to acquire a local field map generated by tissues, followed by application of the morphology-enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) algorithm to estimate a final susceptibility map. Three healthy volunteers and three hemophilic patients were recruited to evaluate the UTE-QSM technique's ability to assess hemosiderin in the knee or ankle joint at 3T. One patient subsequently underwent total knee arthroplasty after the MR scan. The synovial tissues harvested from the knee joint during surgery were processed for histological analysis to confirm iron deposition. RESULTS: UTE-QSM successfully yielded tissue susceptibility maps of joints in both volunteers and patients. Multiple regions with high susceptibility over 1 ppm were detected in the affected joints of hemophilic patients, while no localized regions with high susceptibility were detected in asymptomatic healthy volunteers. Histology confirmed the presence of iron in regions where high susceptibility was detected by UTE-QSM. CONCLUSION: The UTE-QSM technique can detect hemosiderin deposition in the joint, and provides a potential sensitive biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of hemophilic arthropathy."

Focal enhancement is frequently encountered in unruptured aneurysms, but its implication for risk stratification and patient management remains unclear. This study investigates the association of focal wall enhancement with hemodynamic and morphological risk factors and histologic markers of wall inflammation and degeneration. METHODS: Patients with an unruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm who underwent 3D rotational angiography and 3T MR vessel wall imaging showing focal wall enhancement were included. Hemodynamic parameters were calculated based on flow simulations and compared between enhanced regions and the entire aneurysm surface. Morphological parameters were semiautomatically extracted and quantitatively associated with wall enhancement. Histological analysis included detection of vasa vasorum, CD34, and myeloperoxidase staining in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Twenty-two aneurysms were analyzed. Enhanced regions were significantly associated with lower AWSS, lower maxOSI, and increased LSA. In multivariate analysis, higher ellipticity index was an independent predictor of wall enhancement. Histologic signs of inflammation and degeneration and higher PHASES score were significantly associated with focal enhancement. CONCLUSION: Focal wall enhancement is colocalized with hemodynamic factors that have been related to a higher rupture risk. It is correlated with morphological factors linked to rupture risk, higher PHASES score, and histologic markers of wall destabilization. The results support the hypothesis that focal enhancement could serve as a surrogate marker for aneurysm instability."

Purpose To evaluate the effect of DBT slab thickness and overlap on reader performance and interpretation time in the absence of 1-mm slices. Materials and Methods In this retrospective HIPAA-compliant multireader study of DBT examinations performed between August 2013 and July 2017, four fellowship-trained breast imaging radiologists blinded to final histologic findings interpreted DBT examinations by using a standard protocol (10-mm slabs with 5-mm overlap, 1-mm slices, synthetic 2D mammogram) and an experimental protocol (6-mm slabs with 3-mm overlap, synthetic 2D mammogram) with a crossover design. Among the 122 DBT examinations, 74 mammographic findings had final histologic findings, including 31 masses (26 malignant), 20 groups of calcifications (12 malignant), 18 architectural distortions (15 malignant), and five asymmetries (two malignant). Durations of reader interpretations were recorded. Comparisons were made by using receiver operating characteristic curves for diagnostic performance and paired t tests for continuous variables. Results Among 122 women, mean age was 58.6 years +/- 10.1 (standard deviation). For detection of malignancy, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were similar between protocols (range, 0.83-0.94 vs 0.84-0.92; P >/= .63). Mean DBT interpretation time was shorter with the experimental protocol for three of four readers (reader 1, 5.6 minutes +/- 1.7 vs 4.7 minutes +/- 1.4 [P < .001]; reader 2, 2.8 minutes +/- 1.1 vs 2.3 minutes +/- 1.0 [P = .001]; reader 3, 3.6 minutes +/- 1.4 vs 3.3 minutes +/- 1.3 [P = .17]; reader 4, 4.3 minutes +/- 1.0 vs 3.8 minutes +/- 1.1 [P </= .001]), with 72% reduction in both mean number of images and mean file size (P < .001 for both). Conclusion A digital breast tomosynthesis reconstruction protocol that uses 6-mm slabs with 3-mm overlap, without 1-mm slices, had similar diagnostic performance compared with the standard protocol and led to a reduced interpretation time for three of four readers.

Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is commonly used for evaluating skin barrier function; however, direct measurement of TEWL is time-consuming and is not convenient for daily clinical practice. Here, we propose a new skin barrier assessment method using skin images with topological data analysis (TDA). TDA enabled efficient identification of structural features from a skin image taken by a microscope. These features reflected the regularity of the skin texture. We found a significant correlation between the topological features and TEWL. Moreover, using the features as input, we trained machine-learning models to predict TEWL and obtained good accuracy (R(2) = 0.524). Our results suggest that assessment of skin barrier function by topological image analysis is promising."

Screening can improve overall prognosis by detecting the disease early. Biopsy remains as the gold standard for pathological confirmation of malignancy and tumour grading. The development of diagnostic imaging techniques as an alternative for the rapid and accurate characterization of breast masses is necessitated. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) spectroscopy is a modality well suited for this purpose. This study was carried out to evaluate different texture analysis methods applied on QUS spectral parametric images for the characterization of breast lesions. METHODS: Parametric images of mid-band-fit (MBF), spectral-slope (SS), spectral-intercept (SI), average scatterer diameter (ASD), and average acoustic concentration (AAC) were determined using QUS spectroscopy from 193 patients with breast lesions. Texture methods were used to quantify heterogeneities of the parametric images. Three statistical-based approaches for texture analysis that include Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run-length Matrix (GRLM), and Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) methods were evaluated. QUS and texture-parameters were determined from both tumour core and a 5-mm tumour margin and were used in comparison to histopathological analysis in order to classify breast lesions as either benign or malignant. We developed a diagnostic model using different classification algorithms including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine with radial basis function kernel (SVM-RBF), and an artificial neural network (ANN). Model performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and hold-out validation. RESULTS: Classifier performances ranged from 73% to 91% in terms of accuracy dependent on tumour margin inclusion and classifier methodology. Utilizing information from tumour core alone, the ANN achieved the best classification performance of 93% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 91% accuracy, 0.95 AUC using QUS parameters and their GLSZM texture features. CONCLUSIONS: A QUS-based framework and texture analysis methods enabled classification of breast lesions with >90% accuracy. The results suggest that optimizing method for extracting discriminative textural features from QUS spectral parametric images can improve classification performance. Evaluation of the proposed technique on a larger cohort of patients with proper validation technique demonstrated the robustness and generalization of the approach."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative imaging of 40 of 350 patients (median age 66, 31 M/9 F) submitted to liver resection for suspected HCC, between January 2008 and August 2019, has been retrospectively analyzed by two radiologists with different expertise, according to CT/MRI LI-RADS((R)) v2018, both blinded to clinical and pathological results and untrained to using aforementioned scoring system. RESULTS: The perfect agreement between the readers was about 62.5% (25/40) (Cohen k: 0.41), better for LR-5 category (16/25) and higher in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations (68%; 13/19), which has been demonstrated the modality of choice for diagnosis of high probable and certain HCC, with arterial phase hyperenhancement as the most sensitive and accurate major feature. Compared to final histology, LR4 and LR5 scores assigned by senior radiologist reached sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, PNV) and diagnostic accuracy of 90,9%, 29,0%, 93,8%, 62,5% and 87,5%, respectively, slightly higher than junior's ones. Misdiagnosis of HCC was done by both radiologists in the same two patients: 1 primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) and 1 regenerative liver nodule (RLN). If LI-RADS would have been applied at the time of pre-surgical imaging, treatment planning would be modified in 10% of patients (4/40); the patient scheduled as LR-3 and finally resulted a focal nodular hyperplasia would have avoided liver resection. CONCLUSIONS: Application of LI-RADS, especially on MRI, may provide a more accurate evaluation of suspected HCC. PHL and RLN are the Achille's heels according to our experience."

Epub 2020 Aug 27.,Tewary S,J Microsc,2021,2020/08/18,,,10.1111/jmi.12955,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is one of the widely used Immunohistochemical (IHC) markers for prognostic evaluation amongst the patient of breast cancer. Accurate quantification of cell membrane is essential for HER2 scoring in therapeutic decision making. In modern laboratory practice, expert pathologist visually assesses the HER2-stained tissue sample under the bright field microscope for cell membrane assessment. This manual assessment is time consuming, tedious and quite often results in interobserver variability. Further, the burden of increasing number of patients is a challenge for the pathologists. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need with a rapid HER2 cell membrane extraction method. The proposed study aims at developing an automated IHC scoring system, termed as AutoIHC-Analyzer, for automated cell membrane extraction followed by HER2 molecular expression assessment from stained tissue images. A series of image processing approaches have been used to automatically extract the stained cells and membrane region, followed by automatic assessment of complete and broken membrane. Finally, a set of features are used to automatically classify the tissue under observation for the quantitative scoring as 0/1+, 2+ and 3+. In a set of surgically extracted cases of HER2-stained tissues, obtained from collaborative hospital for the testing and validation of the proposed approach AutoIHC-Analyzer and publicly available open source ImmunoMembrane software are compared for 90 set of randomly acquired images with the scores by expert pathologist where significant correlation is observed [(r = 0.9448; p < 0.001) and (r = 0.8521; p < 0.001)] respectively. The output shows promising quantification in automated scoring. LAY DESCRIPTION: In cancer prognosis amongst the patient of breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is used as Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker. The correct assessment of HER2 leads to the therapeutic decision making. In regular practice, the stained tissue sample is observed under a bright microscope and the expert pathologists score the sample as negative (0/1+), equivocal (2+) and positive (3+) case. The scoring is based on the standard guidelines relating the complete and broken cell membrane as well as intensity of staining in the membrane boundary. Such evaluation is time consuming, tedious and quite often results in interobserver variability. To assist in rapid HER2 cell membrane assessment, the proposed study aims at developing an automated IHC scoring system, termed as AutoIHC-Analyzer, for automated cell membrane extraction followed by HER2 molecular expression assessment from stained tissue images. The input image is preprocessed using modified white patch and CMYK and RGB colour space were used in extracting the haematoxylin (negatively stained cells) and diaminobenzidine (DAB) stain observed in the tumour cell membrane. Segmentation and postprocessing are applied to create the masks for each of the stain channels. The membrane mask is then quantified as complete or broken using skeletonisation and morphological operations. Six set of features were assessed for the classification from a set of 180 training images. These features are: complete to broken membrane ratio, amount of stain using area of Blue and Saturation channels to the image size, DAB to haematoxylin ratio from segmented masks and average R, G and B from five largest blobs in segmented DAB-masked image. These features are then used in training the SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel using 5-fold cross-validation. The accuracy in the training sample is found to be 88.3%. The model is then used for 90 set of unknown test sample images and the final labelling of stained cells and HER2 scores (as 0/1+, 2+ and 3+) are compared with the ground truth, that is expert pathologists' score from the collaborative hospital. The test sample images were also fed to ImmunoMembrane software for a comparative assessment. The results from the proposed AutoIHC-Analyzer and ImmunoMembrane software were compared with the expert pathologists' score where significant agreement using Pearson's correlation coefficient [(r = 0.9448; p < 0.001) and (r = 0.8521; p < 0.001) respectively] is observed. The results from AutoIHC-Analyzer show promising quantitative assessment of HER2 scoring."

We developed a pipeline that integrates deep learning on histology specimens with clinical data to predict ICI response in advanced melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a training cohort from New York University (New York, NY) and a validation cohort from Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN). We built a multivariable classifier that integrates neural network predictions with clinical data. A ROC curve was generated and the optimal threshold was used to stratify patients as high versus low risk for progression. Kaplan-Meier curves compared progression-free survival (PFS) between the groups. The classifier was validated on two slide scanners (Aperio AT2 and Leica SCN400). RESULTS: The multivariable classifier predicted response with AUC 0.800 on images from the Aperio AT2 and AUC 0.805 on images from the Leica SCN400. The classifier accurately stratified patients into high versus low risk for disease progression. Vanderbilt patients classified as high risk for progression had significantly worse PFS than those classified as low risk (P = 0.02 for the Aperio AT2; P = 0.03 for the Leica SCN400). CONCLUSIONS: Histology slides and patients' clinicodemographic characteristics are readily available through standard of care and have the potential to predict ICI treatment outcomes. With prospective validation, we believe our approach has potential for integration into clinical practice."

This is a problem especially significant for work on programmed morphogenesis, where the spatial organization of cells and cell types is of paramount importance. To address the challenges of quantitative analysis for such experiments, we have developed TASBE Image Analytics, a software pipeline for automatically segmenting collections of cells using the fluorescence channels of microscopy images. With TASBE Image Analytics, collections of cells can be grouped into spatially disjoint segments, the movement or development of these segments tracked over time, and rich statistical data output in a standardized format for analysis. Processing is readily configurable, rapid, and produces results that closely match hand annotation by humans for all but the smallest and dimmest segments. TASBE Image Analytics can thus provide the analysis necessary to complete the design-build-test-learn cycle for high-throughput experiments in programmed morphogenesis, as validated by our application of this pipeline to process experiments on shape formation with engineered CHO and HEK293 cells."

In basic research, stroke lesion segmentation is necessary to study complex peri-infarction tissue changes. Moreover, final stroke volume is a critical outcome evaluated in clinical and preclinical experiments to determine therapy or intervention success. Manual segmentations are performed but they require a specialized skill set, are prone to inter-observer variation, are not entirely objective and are often not supported by histology. The task is even more challenging when dealing with large multi-center datasets, multiple experimenters or large animal cohorts. On the other hand, current automatized segmentation approaches often lack histological validation, are not entirely user independent, are often based on single parameters, or in the case of complex machine learning methods, require vast training datasets and are prone to a lack of model interpretation. Methods: We induced IS using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model on two rat cohorts. We acquired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2W) images at 24 h and 1-week after IS induction. Subsets of the animals at 24 h and 1-week post IS were evaluated using histology and immunohistochemistry. Using a Gaussian mixture model, we segmented voxel-wise interactions between ADC and T2W parameters at 24 h using one of the rat cohorts. We then used these segmentation results to train a random forest classifier, which we applied to the second rat cohort. The algorithms' stroke segmentations were compared to manual stroke delineations, T2W and ADC thresholding methods and the final stroke segmentation at 1-week. Volume correlations to histology were also performed for every segmentation method. Metrics of success were calculated with respect to the final stroke volume. Finally, the trained random forest classifier was tested on a human dataset with a similar temporal stroke on-set. Manual segmentations, ADC and T2W thresholds were again used to evaluate and perform comparisons with the proposed algorithms' output. Results: In preclinical rat data our framework significantly outperformed commonly applied automatized thresholding approaches and segmented stroke regions similarly to manual delineation. The framework predicted the localization of final stroke regions in 1-week post-stroke MRI with a median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.86, Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.80 and false positive rate of 0.04. The predicted stroke volumes also strongly correlated with final histological stroke regions (Pearson correlation = 0.88, P < 0.0001). Lastly, the stroke region characteristics identified by our framework in rats also identified stroke lesions in human brains, largely outperforming thresholding approaches in stroke volume prediction (P<0.01). Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the segmentation produced by our proposed framework using 24 h MRI rat data strongly correlated with the final stroke volume, denoting a predictive effect. In addition, we show for the first time that the stroke imaging features can be directly translated between species, allowing identification of acute stroke in humans using the model trained on animal data. This discovery reduces the gap between the clinical and preclinical fields, unveiling a novel approach to directly co-analyze clinical and preclinical data. Such methods can provide further biological insights into human stroke and highlight the differences between species in order to help improve the experimental setups and animal models of the disease."

Visual detection of subtle FCDs on MRI is clinically important and often challenging. In this study, we implement a set of 3D local image filters adapted from computer vision applications to characterize the appearance of normal cortex surrounding the gray-white junction. We create a normative model to serve as the basis for a novel multivariate constrained outlier approach to automated FCD detection. METHODS: Standardized MPRAGE, T(2) and FLAIR MR images were obtained in 15 patients with radiologically or histologically diagnosed FCDs and 30 healthy volunteers. Multiscale 3D local image filters were computed for each MR contrast then sampled onto the gray-white junction surface. Using an iterative Gaussianization procedure, we created a normative model of cortical variability in healthy volunteers, allowing for identification of outlier regions and estimates of similarity in normal cortex and FCD lesions. We used a constrained outlier approach following local normalization to automatically detect FCD lesions based on projection onto the mean FCD feature vector. RESULTS: FCDs as well as some normal cortical regions such as primary sensorimotor and paralimbic regions appear as outliers. Regions such as the paralimbic regions and the anterior insula have similar features to FCDs. Our constrained outlier approach allows for automated FCD detection with 80% sensitivity and 70% specificity. SIGNIFICANCE: A normative model using multiscale local image filters can be used to describe the normal cortical variability. Although FCDs appear similar to some cortical regions such as the anterior insula and paralimbic cortices, they can be identified using a constrained outlier detection approach. Our method for detecting outliers and estimating similarity is generic and could be extended to identification of other types of lesions or atypical cortical areas."

These interactions, in turn, are shaped by their subcellular localization and temporal context. Therefore, it is important to be able to analyze the relationships of lncRNAs while preserving cellular architecture. The ability of MEG3 to suppress cell proliferation led to its recognition as a tumor suppressor. MEG3 has been proposed to activate p53 by disrupting the interaction of p53 with mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2). To test this mechanism in the native cellular context, we employed two-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, a single-molecule localization microscopy technique, to detect and quantify the localizations of p53, Mdm2, and MEG3 in U2OS cells. We developed a new cross-nearest neighbor/Monte Carlo algorithm to quantify the association of these molecules. Proof of concept for our method was obtained by examining the association between FKBP1A and mTOR, MEG3 and p53, and Mdm2 and p53. In contrast to previous models, our data support a model in which MEG3 modulates p53 independently of the interaction with Mdm2."

Geochemical, microscopical, and toxicological characterization of clay particulates, their suspensions and filtered leachates was performed on THP-1 and HaCaT cell lines. Cytoskeletal toxicity, cell proliferation/viability (MTT assays), and migration (scratch wounds) were further evaluated. Clays were assayed for antibacterial efficacy using minimum inhibitory concentration assays. All clays possessed a mineral content with antibacterial potential; however, clay leachates contained insufficient ions to have any antibacterial effects. All clay leachates displayed toxicity towards THP-1 monocytes, while clay suspensions showed less toxicity, suggesting immunogenicity. Reduced clay cytotoxicity on HaCaTs was shown, as many leachates stimulated wound-healing responses. The ""Green"" clay exhibited antibacterial effects and only in suspension, which was lost upon neutralization. pH and its interaction with clay particle surface charge is more significant than previously understood to emphasize dangers of unregulated marketing and unsubstantiated bioceutical claims."

It is caused by the Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in almost 90% of all cases. HCC is a malignant tumor and the most common histological type of the primary liver cancers. The detection and evaluation of viable tumor regions in HCC present an important clinical significance since it is a key step to assess response of chemoradiotherapy and tumor cell proportion in genetic tests. Recent advances in computer vision, digital pathology and microscopy imaging enable automatic histopathology image analysis for cancer diagnosis. In this paper, we present a multi-resolution deep learning model HistoCAE for viable tumor segmentation in whole-slide liver histopathology images. We propose convolutional autoencoder (CAE) based framework with a customized reconstruction loss function for image reconstruction, followed by a classification module to classify each image patch as tumor versus non-tumor. The resulting patch-based prediction results are spatially combined to generate the final segmentation result for each WSI. Additionally, the spatially organized encoded feature map derived from small image patches is used to compress the gigapixel whole-slide images. Our proposed model presents superior performance to other benchmark models with extensive experiments, suggesting its efficacy for viable tumor area segmentation with liver whole-slide images."

In order to reduce workload on pathologists and strengthen the telehealth services, an automatic self-focusing microscope with different field image collection mechanism is required. In this work, the conversion of a compound microscope into a complete digital self-focusing automatic microscope, with intelligent field image collection mechanism, is discussed. This method uses passive autofocusing technique. In this method, most informative regions are identified on the basis of texture information. Features from these identified regions are used for autofocusing the microscope. This system is capable of collecting multiple snaps from different regions of the smear sample slides. The problem with the smear slide is that it has un-uniform thickness upon the glass slide. So some region has a very thick layer and some region has a very thin layer. In general, both of these regions are not considered for pathological analysis. The proposed system is capable to detect the region of smear slide which is suitable for collection of snap images. A soft computing approach is used to detect the desired regions of the sample in the slide. The Raspberry pi is used to design the control section. Multi-threaded parallel programming is used to optimize I/O execution and waiting time. The performance of the proposed system is satisfactory. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is about 33 in comparison with manual focusing by the domain expert. The performance of the system in terms of computation time, which is calculated on the benchmark microscopic image dataset, is better than other learning-based methods. Autofocusing of pathological microscope with an intelligent field image collection mechanism is highly useful in the remote healthcare domain. This work basically describes a mechanism to migrate the conventional compound microscope into a tale-health service compatible (IoT enabled) microscope. This system is highly suitable for developing countries where an overall change of existing infrastructure is difficult due to economic reasons."

However, since the slide preparation differs for each dye, the tissue slides are being deformed and a nonrigid registration is required before further processing. The registration of histology images is complicated because of: (i) a high resolution of histology images, (ii) complex, large, nonrigid deformations, (iii) difference in the appearance and partially missing data due to the use of multiple dyes. In this work, we propose a multistep, automatic, nonrigid image registration method dedicated to histology samples acquired with multiple stains. The proposed method consists of a feature-based affine registration, an exhaustive rotation alignment, an iterative, intensity-based affine registration, and a nonrigid alignment based on modality independent neighbourhood descriptor coupled with the Demons algorithm. A dedicated failure detection mechanism is proposed to make the method fully automatic, without the necessity of any manual interaction. The described method was proposed by the AGH team during the Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration (ANHIR) challenge. The ANHIR dataset consists of 481 image pairs annotated by histology experts. Moreover, the ANHIR challenge submissions were evaluated using an independent, server-side evaluation tool. The main evaluation criteria was the target registration error normalized by the image diagonal. The median of median target registration error is below 0.19%. The proposed method is currently the second-best in terms of the average ranking of median target registration error, without statistically significant differences compared to the top-ranked method. We provide an open access to the method software and used parameters, making the results fully reproducible."

Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on these compressed image representations to predict image-level labels, avoiding the need for fine-grained manual annotations. We compared several encoding strategies, namely reconstruction error minimization, contrastive training and adversarial feature learning, and evaluated NIC on a synthetic task and two public histopathology datasets.

We propose a framework to encode the geometric structure of the special Euclidean motion group SE(2) in convolutional networks to yield translation and rotation equivariance via the introduction of SE(2)-group convolution layers. This structure enables models to learn feature representations with a discretized orientation dimension that guarantees that their outputs are invariant under a discrete set of rotations. Conventional approaches for rotation invariance rely mostly on data augmentation, but this does not guarantee the robustness of the output when the input is rotated. At that, trained conventional CNNs may require test-time rotation augmentation to reach their full capability. This study is focused on histopathology image analysis applications for which it is desirable that the arbitrary global orientation information of the imaged tissues is not captured by the machine learning models. The proposed framework is evaluated on three different histopathology image analysis tasks (mitosis detection, nuclei segmentation and tumor detection). We present a comparative analysis for each problem and show that consistent increase of performances can be achieved when using the proposed framework."

Epub 2020 Dec 21.,Feng C,Med Phys,2021,2020/12/07,,,10.1002/mp.14646,"PURPOSE: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a malformation of cortical development that often causes pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. However, FCD lesions are frequently characterized by minor structural abnormalities that can easily go unrecognized, making diagnosis difficult. Therefore, many epileptic patients have had pathologically confirmed FCD lesions that appeared normal in pre-surgical fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) studies. Such lesions are called ""FLAIR-negative."" This study aimed to improve the detection of histopathologically verified FCD in a sample of patients without visually appreciable lesions. METHODS: The technique first extracts a series of features from a FLAIR image. Then, three naive Bayesian classifiers with probability (NBCP) are trained based on different numbers of feature maps to classify voxels as lesional or healthy voxels and assign the lesions a probability of correct classification. This method classifies the three-dimensional (3D) images of all patients using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Finally, the 3D lesion probability map, including epileptogenic lesions, is obtained by removing false-positive voxel outliers using the morphological method. The performance of the NBCP was assessed for quantitative analysis by specificity, accuracy, recall, precision, and Dice coefficient in subject-wise, lesion-wise, and voxel-wise manners. RESULTS: The best detection results were obtained by using four features: cortical thickness, symmetry, K-means, and modified texture energy. There were eight lesions in seven patients. The subject-wise sensitivity of the proposed method was 85.71% (6/7). Seven out of eight lesions were detected, so the lesion-wise sensitivity was 87.50% (7/8). No significant differences in effectiveness were found between automated lesion detection using four features and lesion detection using manual segmentation, as voxels were quantitatively analyzed in terms of specificity (mean +/- SD = 99.64 +/- 0.13), accuracy (mean +/- SD = 99.62 +/- 0.14), recall (mean +/- SD = 73.27 +/- 26.11), precision (mean +/- SD = 11.93 +/- 8.16), and Dice coefficient (mean +/- SD = 22.82 +/- 15.57). CONCLUSION: We developed a novel automatic voxel-based method to improve the detection of FCD FLAIR-negative lesions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to detect FCD lesions that appear normal in pre-surgical 3D high-resolution FLAIR images alone with a limited number of radiomics features. We optimized the algorithm and selected the best prior probability to improve the detection. For non-temporal lobe epilepsy (non-TLE) patients, lesions could be accurately located, although there were still false-positive areas."

A micro-MRI was used to scan each meniscus, immersed in distilled water, and a 3D digital model was reconstructed afterwards. A three-dimensional (3D) resin model was printed out based on the digital model. Before high-resolution micro-CT scanning, each meniscus was freeze-dried. Then, micro-scale two-dimensional (2D) CT projection images were obtained. The porosity of the meniscus was calculated according to micro-CT images. With micro-CT, multiple 2D projection images were collected. A 3D digital model based on 2D CT pictures was also reconstructed. The 3D digital model was exported as STL format. A 3D resin model was printed by 3D printer based on the 3D digital model. RESULTS: As revealed in the HE and Masson images, a meniscus is mostly composed of collagen, with a few cells disseminated between the collagen fiber bundles at the micro-scale. The SEM image clearly shows the path of highly cross-linked collagen fibers, and massive pores exist between the fibers. According to the SEM images, the porosity of the meniscus was 34.1% (34.1% +/- 0.032%) and the diameters of the collagen fibers were varied. In addition, the cross-linking pattern of the fibers was irregular. The scanning accuracy of micro-MRI was 50 mum. The micro-MRI demonstrated the outline of the meniscus, but the microstructure was obscure. The micro-CT clearly displayed microfibers in the meniscus with a voxel size of 11.4 mum. The surface layer, lamellar layer, circumferential fibers, and radial fibers could be identified. The mean porosity of the meniscus according to micro-CT images was 33.92% (33.92% +/- 0.03%). Moreover, a 3D model of the microstructure based on the micro-CT images was built. The microscale fibers could be displayed in the micro-CT image and the reconstructed 3D digital model. In addition, a 3D resin model was printed out based on the 3D digital model. CONCLUSION: It is extremely difficult to artificially simulate the microstructure of the meniscus because of the irregularity of the diameter and cross-linking pattern of fibers. The micro-MRI images failed to demonstrate the meniscus microstructure. Freeze-drying and micro-CT scanning are effective methods for 3D microstructure reconstruction of the meniscus, which is an important step towards mechanically functional 3D-printed meniscus grafts."

We report a novel pooled screening approach for a wider range of cellular and subtle subcellular phenotypes. Machine learning and convolutional neural network models are trained on the subcellular phenotype to be queried. Genome-wide screening then utilizes cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi), photoactivatable fluorescent protein (PA-mCherry), and a lentiviral guide RNA (gRNA) pool. Cells are screened by using microscopy and classified by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which precisely identify the genetically altered phenotype. Cells with the phenotype of interest are photoactivated and isolated via flow cytometry, and the gRNAs are identified by sequencing. A proof-of-concept screen accurately identified PINK1 as essential for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria. A genome-wide screen identified factors mediating TFEB relocation from the nucleus to the cytosol upon prolonged starvation. Twenty-one of the 64 hits called by the neural network model were independently validated, revealing new effectors of TFEB subcellular localization. This approach, AI-photoswitchable screening (AI-PS), offers a novel screening platform capable of classifying a broad range of mammalian subcellular morphologies, an approach largely unattainable with current methodologies at genome-wide scale."

It is observed that ultrasmall (<10 nm) fluorescent core-shell aluminosilicate nanoparticles (aC' dots) covalently encapsulating organic fluorophores enable STORM with a single excitation source and in a regular (non-toxic) imaging buffer. It is shown that fourfold coordinated aluminum is responsible for dye blinking, likely via photoinduced redox processes. It is demonstrated that this phenomenon is observed across different dye families leading to probes brighter and more photostable than the parent free dyes. Functionalization of aC' dots with antibodies allows targeted fixed cell STORM imaging. Finally, aC' dots enable live-cell STORM imaging providing quantitative measures of the size of intracellular vesicles and the number of particles per vesicle. The results suggest the emergence of a powerful ultrasmall, bright, and photostable optical SRM particle platform with characteristics relevant to clinical translation for the quantitative assessment of cellular structures and processes from live-cell imaging."

Structural analysis using magnetic resonance imaging with T1-weighted sequences has the potential to quantify histopathological changes. Degeneration is typically measured by the volume and shape of morphological changes. However, these changes appear late in the disease, preventing their use as surrogate markers. We investigated texture changes in 108 individuals, divided into three groups, matched in terms of sex and age: (1) healthy controls (n = 32); (2) patients with early-stage PD (n = 39); and (3) patients with late-stage PD and severe L-dopa-related complications (n = 37). All patients were assessed in off-treatment conditions. Statistical analysis of first- and second-order texture features was conducted in the substantia nigra, striatum, thalamus and sub-thalamic nucleus. Regions of interest volumetry and voxel-based morphometry were performed for comparison. Significantly different texture features were observed between the three populations, with some showing a gradual linear progression between the groups. The volumetric changes in the two PD patient groups were not significantly different. Texture features were significantly associated with clinical scores for motor handicap. These results suggest that texture features, measured in the nigrostriatal pathway at PD diagnosis, may be useful in predicting clinical progression of motor handicap."

Firstly, to address the shortcomings of traditional image segmentation methods, two different deep learning methods are designed to achieve the segmentation of uterine fibroids. The deep lab model is used to optimize the lesion edge detailed information by using the void convolution algorithm and fully connected CRF, and the two semantic segmentation networks are compared to obtain the best results. The Mask RCNN case segmentation model is used to effectively extract features through the ResNet structure, combined with the RPN network to achieve effective use and fusion of features, and continuously optimize the network training to achieve a fine segmentation of the lesion area, and demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the two models in medical image segmentation. Histopathology was used to obtain ER, PR, HER scores, and Ki-67 percentage values for all patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival estimation, the Log-rank test was used for single-factor analysis, and Cox proportional risk regression was used for multifactor analysis. The prognostic value of each factor was calculated, as well as the factors affecting progression-free survival. This study was done to compare the imaging characteristics and diagnostic value of mammography and colour Doppler ultrasonography in nonspecific mastitis, improve the understanding of the imaging characteristics of nonspecific mastitis in these two examinations, improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of this type of disease, improve the ability of distinguishing it from breast cancer, and reduce the rate of misdiagnosis."
33571221,Assessment of breast cancer surgical margins with multimodal optical microscopy: A feasibility clinical study,"Scimone MT, Krishnamurthy S, Maguluri G, Preda D, Park J, Grimble J, Song M, Ban K, Iftimia N.",PLoS One. 2021 Feb 11;16(2):e0245334. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0245334. eCollection 2021.,Scimone MT,PLoS One,2021,2021/02/11,PMC7877783,,10.1371/journal.pone.0245334,"Providing surgical margin information during breast cancer surgery is crucial for the success of the procedure. The margin is defined as the distance from the tumor to the cut surface of the resection specimen. The consensus among surgeons and radiation oncologists is that there should be no tumor left within 1 to maximum 2 mm from the surface of the surgical specimen. If a positive margin remains, there is substantial risk for tumor recurrence, which may also result in potentially reduced cosmesis and eventual need for mastectomy. In this paper we report a novel multimodal optical imaging instrument based on combined high-resolution confocal microscopy-optical coherence tomography imaging for assessing the presence of potential positive margins on surgical specimens. Since rapid specimen analysis is critical during surgery, this instrument also includes a fluorescence imaging channel to enable rapid identification of the areas of the specimen that have potential positive margins. This is possible by specimen incubation with a cancer specific agent prior to imaging. In this study we used a quenched contrast agent, which is activated by cancer specific enzymes, such as urokinase plasminogen activators (uPA). Using this agent or a similar one, one may limit the use of high-resolution optical imaging to only fluorescence-highlighted areas for visualizing tissue morphology at the sub-cellular scale and confirming or ruling out cancer presence. Preliminary evaluation of this technology was performed on 20 surgical specimens and testing of the optical imaging findings was performed against histopathology. The combination of the three imaging modes allowed for high correlation between optical image analysis and histological ground-truth. The initial results are encouraging, showing instrument capability to assess margins on clinical specimens with a positive predictive value of 1.0 and a negative predictive value of 0.83."

Such information can provide insights into protein structure, aid in development of genetically encoded probes, and allow determinations of lipid membrane properties. However, quantitating and interpreting linear dichroism in biological systems has been laborious and unreliable. Here we present a set of open source ImageJ-based software tools that allow fast and easy linear dichroism visualization and quantitation, as well as extraction of quantitative information on molecular orientations, even in living systems. The tools were tested on model synthetic lipid vesicles and applied to a variety of biological systems, including observations of conformational changes during G-protein signaling in living cells, using fluorescent proteins. Our results show that our tools and model systems are applicable to a wide range of molecules and polarization-resolved microscopy techniques, and represent a significant step towards making polarization microscopy a mainstream tool of biological imaging."

Epub 2020 Dec 15.,Bielski K,Neuroimage,2021,2020/12/18,,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117644,"Several previous attempts have been made to divide the human amygdala into smaller subregions based on the unique functional properties of the subregions. Although these attempts have provided valuable insight into the functional heterogeneity in this structure, the possibility that spatial patterns of functional characteristics can quickly change over time has rarely been considered in previous studies. In the present study, we explicitly account for the dynamic nature of amygdala activity. Our goal was not only to develop another parcellation method but also to augment existing methods with novel information about amygdala subdivisions. We performed state-specific amygdala parcellation using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RsfMRI data from 102 subjects were acquired with a 3T Trio Siemens scanner. We analyzed values of several RQA measures across all voxels in the amygdala and found two amygdala subdivisions, the ventrolateral (VL) and dorsomedial (DM) subdivisions, that differ with respect to one of the RQA measures, Shannon's entropy of diagonal lines. Compared to the DM subdivision, the VL subdivision can be characterized by a higher value of entropy. The results suggest that VL activity is determined and influenced by more brain structures than is DM activity. To assess the biological validity of the obtained subdivisions, we compared them with histological atlases and currently available parcellations based on structural connectivity patterns (Anatomy Probability Maps) and cytoarchitectonic features (SPM Anatomy toolbox). Moreover, we examined their cortical and subcortical functional connectivity. The obtained results are similar to those previously reported on parcellation performed on the basis of structural connectivity patterns. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that the VL subdivision has strong connections to several cortical areas, whereas the DM subdivision is mainly connected to subcortical regions. This finding suggests that the VL subdivision corresponds to the basolateral subdivision of the amygdala (BLA), while the DM subdivision has some characteristics typical of the centromedial amygdala (CMA). The similarity in functional connectivity patterns between the VL subdivision and BLA, as well as between the DM subdivision and CMA, confirm the utility of our parcellation method. Overall, the study shows that parcellation based on BOLD signal dynamics is a powerful tool for identifying distinct functional systems within the amygdala. This tool might be useful for future research on functional brain organization."

Once LVI is formed, it indicates the tumor has metastasized or has the possibility of metastasis. In this work, multiphoton microscopy (MPM), which relies on the two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG), was applied to identify the typical morphology of LVI and also visualize the histological features of LVI. Furthermore, the pixel density of collagen fibers was extracted as a quantitative parameter to differentiate LVI from the ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). By comparing with the corresponding H&E-stained images, it was confirmed that MPM can be used as an auxiliary tool for pathologists to diagnose LVI, and has a possibility for the application in clinical examination."

METHODS: A computerized literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar was performed up to June 2020. Two authors independently conducted search, screening, quality assessment, and extraction of data from the eligible studies. Studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. RESULTS: Of the 476 articles identified, 22 articles met the inclusion criteria. No significant association was found between BPE and invasiveness, histological cancer type, T- and N-stage, multifocality, lymphatic and vascular invasion and histological tumour grade while the association between BPE and molecular subtypes is still unclear. As predictive biomarker, a greater decrease in BPE during and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with pathological complete response. Results about the role of BPE as prognostic factor were inconsistent. An association between high BPE and microvessel density, CD34 and VEGF (histological markers of vascularization and angiogenesis) was found. CONCLUSIONS: BPE of the contralateral breast is associated with breast cancer in several aspects, therefore it has been proposed as a tool to refine breast cancer decision-making process. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Additional researches with standardized BPE assessment are needed to translate this emerging biomarker into clinical practice in the era of personalized medicine."

The objective of this study was to compare a digital 3D exoscope system with a standard operating microscope as a neurosurgical visualization tool in a highly challenging experimental setting. METHODS: End-to-side bypass procedures, each at a depth of 9 cm, were performed in a simulation setting. The quality of the task and the depth effect, visualization, magnification, illumination, and ergonomics were evaluated. RESULTS: No major differences were noted between the microscope and the 3D exoscope in terms of the quality of the work. Working with the 3D exoscope was more time-consuming than working with the microscope. Changing the depth and focus was faster using the operative microscope. The 3D exoscope enabled higher magnification and offered better ergonomic features. CONCLUSIONS: In a highly challenging experimental setting, comparable procedural quality was found for the microscope and the 3D exoscope. Each visualization tool had advantages and disadvantages. Over time and with technologic advances, the digital 3D exoscope may become the main operative visualization system in microneurosurgery."

One such step is the identification and separation of helical protein polymorphs at early stages of image processing. Here, we tested and evaluated our recent clustering approach on three datasets containing amyloid fibrils, demonstrating that the proposed unsupervised clustering method automatically and effectively identifies the polymorphs from cryo-EM images. As an automated polymorph separation method, it has the potential to complement automated helical picking, which typically cannot easily distinguish between polymorphs with subtle differences in morphology, and is therefore a useful tool for the image processing and structure determination of helical proteins."

Although powerful, both techniques have limitations. Hi-C is challenging for low cell numbers and requires very deep sequencing to achieve its high resolution. In contrast, FISH can be done on small cell numbers and capture rare cell populations, but typically targets pairs of loci at a lower resolution. Here we detail a protocol for optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture (ORCA), a microscopy approach to trace the 3D DNA path within the nuclei of fixed tissues and cultured cells with a genomic resolution as fine as 2 kb and a throughput of ~10,000 cells per experiment. ORCA can identify structural features with comparable resolution to Hi-C while providing single-cell resolution and multimodal measurements characteristic of microscopy. We describe how to use this DNA labeling in parallel with multiplexed labeling of dozens of RNAs to relate chromatin structure and gene expression in the same cells. Oligopaint probe design, primary probe making, sample collection, cryosectioning and RNA/DNA primary probe hybridization can be completed in 1.5 weeks, while automated RNA/DNA barcode hybridization and RNA/DNA imaging typically takes 2-6 d for data collection and 2-7 d for the automated steps of image analysis."

METHODS: Patients selected were highly suspicious of harboring focal structural lesions and had negative brain MRI studies. MAP was performed using a locally obtained adult database as a template. Results were reviewed by two neuroradiologists. Pertinence of MAP-positive areas was confirmed by the focal epileptic hypothesis or by pathology when possible (J Neuroradiol, 39, 2012, 87). Visual analysis was performed using Mango Software. MRI studies were reanalyzed at the workstation with knowledge of the clinical suspicion to confirm or discard the possibility of FCD. RESULTS: Five patients aged 19-48 months were studied, all with initial 3T MRI studies interpreted as normal. All had focal epileptic hypothesis with coherence of clinical seizure characterization and electroencephalographic findings. In two patients, histology showed type 1 FCD. Due to the age of our subjects, the junction map always highlighted the subcortical white matter in relationship to maturity differences. FCD was identified as asymmetric U-shaped highlighted regions in the junction map. SIGNIFICANCE: FCD is the most frequent pathology reported in pediatric epilepsy surgery series (Epileptic Disord, 18, 2016, 240). Significant number of FCDs may be overlooked on MRIs, reducing the odds of seizure freedom after surgery (Epilepsy Res, 89, 2010, 310). MAP is an image postprocessing method for enhanced visualization of FCD; however, when using an adult template in developing brains, normal subcortical regions may be highlighted as pathological. Creating a pediatric template is difficult, due to the need for general anesthesia to acquire the MRI database. Here, we were able to show that MAP identified FCDs as asymmetric ""U-"" shaped highlighted regions in the junction maps of all five patients, which may indicate that obtaining childhood databases for this purpose may not be necessary and that adult ones suffice for diagnosis of FCD."

We use convolutional autoencoders and sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on paired histological images and bulk gene expression to identify subsets of genes whose expression levels in a tissue sample correlate with subsets of morphological features from the corresponding sample image. We apply our approach, ImageCCA, to two TCGA data sets, and find gene sets associated with the structure of the extracellular matrix and cell wall infrastructure, implicating uncharacterized genes in extracellular processes. We find sets of genes associated with specific cell types, including neuronal cells and cells of the immune system. We apply ImageCCA to the GTEx v6 data, and find image features that capture population variation in thyroid and in colon tissues associated with genetic variants (image morphology QTLs, or imQTLs), suggesting that genetic variation regulates population variation in tissue morphological traits."

Our method leverages >1.6 million annotations from board-certified pathologists across >5700 samples to train deep learning models for cell and tissue classification that can exhaustively map whole-slide images at two and four micron-resolution. Cell- and tissue-type model outputs are combined into 607 HIFs that quantify specific and biologically-relevant characteristics across five cancer types. We demonstrate that these HIFs correlate with well-known markers of the tumor microenvironment and can predict diverse molecular signatures (AUROC 0.601-0.864), including expression of four immune checkpoint proteins and homologous recombination deficiency, with performance comparable to 'black-box' methods. Our HIF-based approach provides a comprehensive, quantitative, and interpretable window into the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment."

By this process, the fluorescence impulse responses (FluoIRs) of the sample are decoupled from the instrument response (InstR). In blind deconvolution estimation (BDE), the FluoIRs and InstR are jointly extracted from a dataset with minimal a priori information. In this work, two BDE algorithms are introduced based on linear combinations of multi-exponential functions to model each FluoIR in the sample. For both schemes, the InstR is assumed with a free-form and a sparse structure. The local perspective of the BDE methodology assumes that the characteristic parameters of the exponential functions (time constants and scaling coefficients) are estimated based on a single spatial point of the dataset. On the other hand, the same exponential functions are used in the whole dataset in the global perspective, and just the scaling coefficients are updated for each spatial point. A least squares formulation is considered for both BDE algorithms. To overcome the nonlinear interaction in the decision variables, an alternating least squares (ALS) methodology iteratively solves both estimation problems based on non-negative and constrained optimizations. The validation stage considered first synthetic datasets at different noise types and levels, and a comparison with the standard deconvolution techniques with a multi-exponential model for FLIM measurements, as well as, with two BDE methodologies in the state of the art: Laguerre basis, and exponentials library. For the experimental evaluation, fluorescent dyes and oral tissue samples were considered. Our results show that local and global perspectives are consistent with the standard deconvolution techniques, and they reached the fastest convergence responses among the BDE algorithms with the best compromise in FluoIRs and InstR estimation errors."

In general, the acquisition of single-cell time courses from cultured cells is hampered by cell motility and diversity of cell shapes. Adhesive micro-arrays standardize single-cell conditions and facilitate image analysis. LISCA combines single-cell microarrays with scanning time-lapse microscopy and automated image processing. Here, we describe the experimental steps of taking single-cell fluorescence time courses in a LISCA format. We transfect cells adherent to a micropatterned array using mRNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and monitor the eGFP expression kinetics of hundreds of cells in parallel via scanning time-lapse microscopy. The image data stacks are automatically processed by newly developed software that integrates fluorescence intensity over selected cell contours to generate single-cell fluorescence time courses. We demonstrate that eGFP expression time courses after mRNA transfection are well described by a simple kinetic translation model that reveals expression and degradation rates of mRNA. Further applications of LISCA for event time correlations of multiple markers in the context of signaling apoptosis are discussed."

Although ILCs are mainly known as tissue-resident cells, their precise localization and interactions with the microenvironment are still unclear. Here we combine a multiplexed immunofluorescence technique and a customized computational, open-source analysis pipeline to unambiguously identify CD127(+) ILCs in situ and characterize these cells and their microenvironments. Moreover, we reveal the transcription factor IRF4 as a marker for tonsillar ILC3, and identify conserved stromal landmarks characteristic for ILC localization. We also show that CD127(+) ILCs share tissue niches with plasma cells in the tonsil. Our works thus provide a platform for multiparametric histological analysis of ILCs to improve our understanding of ILC biology."

The refractive index map of invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas were constructed from an inverse electromagnetic problem. Morphological dilation combined with refractive index thresholding was conducted to classify the tissue regions as malignant or benign. A histology routine was conducted to evaluate the performances of various dilation geometries associated with different thresholds. It was found that the combination of a wide structuring element and high refractive index was improving the correctness of tissue classification in comparison to other configurations or without dilation. The method reports a sensitivity of around 80% and a specificity of 82% for the best case. These results indicate that combining the fundamental optical properties of tissues denoted by their refractive index with morphological dilation may open routes to define supporting procedures during breast-conserving surgeries.

The present study analyzed possible correlations between histogram analysis parameters derived from Intravoxel-incoherent imaging (IVIM) and histopathological features in rectal cancer (RC). METHODS: Seventeen patients with histopathologically proven rectal adenocarcinomas were retrospectively acquired. In all cases, pelvic MRI was performed. Diffusion weighted imaging was obtained using a multi-slice single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence with b values of 0, 50, 200, 500 and 1000 s/mm(2). Simplified IVIM analysis was performed using the IntelliSpace portal, version 10 and the following images were generated: f (perfusion fraction) map, D (true diffusion coefficient) map, and ADC map utilizing all b-values. Histogram based analysis of signal intensities was performed for every IVIM map using an in-house matlab tool. Histopathology was investigated using Ki 67 specimens with calculation of Ki 67-index and cellularity. CD31 stained specimens were used for calculation of microvessel density (MVD). RESULTS: There were statistically significant correlations between Ki 67 index and mode derived from ADC as well as entropy from f, r=-0.50, p=.04 and r=-0.55, p=.02, respectively. MVD correlated well with parameters derived from f. CONCLUSION: IVIM histogram analysis parameters can reflect histopathology in RC. ADC and D values are associated with proliferation potential. Perfusion fraction f is associated with MVD."

Most previous work on whole slide image analysis has focused on classification or segmentation of small pre-selected regions-of-interest, which requires fine-grained annotation and is non-trivial to extend for large-scale whole slide analysis. In this paper, we proposed a multi-resolution multiple instance learning model that leverages saliency maps to detect suspicious regions for fine-grained grade prediction. Instead of relying on expensive region- or pixel-level annotations, our model can be trained end-to-end with only slide-level labels. The model is developed on a large-scale prostate biopsy dataset containing 20,229 slides from 830 patients. The model achieved 92.7% accuracy, 81.8% Cohen's Kappa for benign, low grade (i.e. Grade group 1) and high grade (i.e. Grade group >/= 2) prediction, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 98.2% and an average precision (AP) of 97.4% for differentiating malignant and benign slides.

The reliability of intracranial hemodynamic simulations strongly depends on the underlying models. Due to the missing information about the intracranial vessel wall, the patient-specific wall thickness is often neglected as well as the specific physiological and pathological properties of the vessel wall. METHODS: In this work, we present a model for structural simulations with patient-specific wall thickness including different tissue types based on postmortem histologic image data. Images of histologic 2D slices from intracranial aneurysms were manually segmented in nine tissue classes. After virtual inflation, they were combined into 3D models. This approach yields multiple 3D models of the inner and outer wall and different tissue parts as a prerequisite for subsequent simulations. RESULT: We presented a pipeline to generate 3D models of aneurysms with respect to the different tissue textures occurring in the wall. First experiments show that including the variance of the tissue in the structural simulation affect the simulation result. Especially at the interfaces between neighboring tissue classes, the larger influence of stiffer components on the stability equilibrium became obvious. CONCLUSION: The presented approach enables the creation of a geometric model with differentiated wall tissue. This information can be used for different applications, like hemodynamic simulations, to increase the modeling accuracy."

Current practice includes manual or pseudo-manual measurement of somatic areas, which is labor-intensive and prone to human biases and intra-/inter-observer variances. We developed a novel high-throughput neuronal morphology analysis framework (ANMAF), using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically contour the somatic area of fluorescent neurons in acute brain slices. Our results demonstrate considerable agreements between human annotators and ANMAF on detection, segmentation, and the area of somatic regions in neurons expressing a genetically encoded fluorophore. However, in contrast to humans, who exhibited significant variability in repeated measurements, ANMAF produced consistent neuronal contours. ANMAF was generalizable across different imaging protocols and trainable even with a small number of humanly labeled neurons. Our framework can facilitate more rigorous and quantitative studies of neuronal morphology by enabling the segmentation of many fluorescent neurons in thick brain slices in a standardized manner."

In the case of cancer, when a functionally impactful mutation (i.e. genetic variant) is identified in a disease-relevant gene, the patient is at elevated risk of developing a lesion in their lifetime. Unfortunately, as the rate and coverage of genetic testing has accelerated, our ability to assess the functional status of new variants has fallen behind. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more practical, streamlined and cost-effective methods for classifying variants. RESULTS: To directly address this issue, we designed a new approach that uses alterations in protein subcellular localization as a key indicator of loss of function. Thus, new variants can be rapidly functionalized using high-content microscopy (HCM). To facilitate the analysis of the large amounts of imaging data, we developed a new software toolkit, named MAPS for machine-assisted phenotype scoring, that utilizes deep learning to extract and classify cell-level features. MAPS helps users leverage cloud-based deep learning services that are easy to train and deploy to fit their specific experimental conditions. Model training is code-free and can be done with limited training images. Thus, MAPS allows cell biologists to easily incorporate deep learning into their image analysis pipeline. We demonstrated an effective variant functionalization workflow that integrates HCM and MAPS to assess missense variants of PTEN, a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in hereditary and somatic cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a new way to rapidly assess variant function using cloud deep learning. Since most tumor suppressors have well-defined subcellular localizations, our approach could be widely applied to functionalize variants of uncertain significance and help improve the utility of genetic testing."

METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was performed of our mammography and pathology databases from October 2012 to May 2015 to identify biopsy-proven invasive breast carcinoma detected on screening and diagnostic mammograms by 2D plus 3D (2D + 3D) imaging. Percentages of cancer detection by 2D and 3D were compared. Correlation with histopathology and lymph node status was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 53 cancers diagnosed on 12 543 screening mammograms, 36 (67.9%) were better visualized on 3D (not visualized, equivocal, or only seen in retrospect on 2D). Of the 62 cancers diagnosed on 4090 diagnostic mammograms, 24 (38.7%) cancers were better detected on 3D. A statistically significant greater number of cancers were better detected on 3D in the screening compared to the diagnostic mammograms (67.9% vs 38.7%, P < .05). A significantly higher frequency of less aggressive tumors (grade I and grade II, positive estrogen/progesterone receptor, Her2 negative) was detected by 3D, with higher significance in the screening population. Additionally, there was a higher frequency of positive axillary lymph nodes in cancers detected by 3D in the screening group. CONCLUSION: Three-dimension increases invasive breast cancer detection, particularly pathologically less aggressive tumors, in both screening and diagnostic mammograms with more benefit for the screening population. Three-dimensional mammography detected more breast cancer associated with metastatic axillary lymph nodes in the screening population."

Given the difficulty of obtaining manual annotations, weak supervision is more suitable for the task than full supervision is. However, most weakly supervised models are not ideal for handling severe intra-class heterogeneity and inter-class homogeneity in histopathology images. Therefore, we propose a novel end-to-end weakly supervised learning framework named WESUP. With only sparse point annotations, it performs accurate segmentation and exhibits good generalizability. The training phase comprises two major parts, hierarchical feature representation and deep dynamic label propagation. The former uses superpixels to capture local details and global context from the convolutional feature maps obtained via transfer learning. The latter recognizes the manifold structure of the hierarchical features and identifies potential targets with the sparse annotations. Moreover, these two parts are trained jointly to improve the performance of the whole framework. To further boost test performance, pixel-wise inference is adopted for finer prediction. As demonstrated by experimental results, WESUP is able to largely resolve the confusion between histological foreground and background. It outperforms several state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on a variety of histopathology datasets with minimal annotation efforts. Trained by very sparse point annotations, WESUP can even beat an advanced fully supervised segmentation network."

METHODS: Ninety-four AD lesions on CEDM in combination with tomosynthesis were retrospectively reviewed from 92 consecutive women (mean age, 52.4 years +/- 7.9) with abnormal diagnostic or screening mammography. CEDM results were correlated with histology of ADs using cross-tabulation for statistical analysis. Predictors for risk of malignancy from CEDM characteristics (background parenchyma enhancement, degree of AD enhancement, enhancing morphology, size of enhancement, and enhancing spiculations) and patient's age were evaluated using logistic regression. We propose a sum score, termed AD score (ADS), for risk stratification and corresponding suggested BI-RADS category. RESULTS: Thirty-three of ninety-four (35.1%) of detected AD lesions were malignant. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CEDM in evaluation of malignant AD are 100%, 42.6%, 48.5%, and 100%, respectively. Absence of AD enhancement on CEDM is highly indicative of no underlying malignancy. On multivariate analysis, the predictors on CEDM with statistical significance are (1) marked intensity of AD enhancement (OR, 22.6; 95%CI 3.1, 166.6; p = .002); and (2) presence of enhancing spiculations (OR, 9.1; 95%CI 2.2, 36.5; p = .002). A prediction model whose scores (ADS) given by ranking of OR of all predictors with AUC of 0.934 and Brier score of 0.0956 was developed. CONCLUSION: ADS-based lesion characterization on CEDM enables risk assessment of tomosynthesis-detected AD lesions. KEY POINTS: * Architecture distortions presenting with marked enhancement intensity and presence of enhancing spiculations are highly associated with risk of malignancy. * Absence of architecture distortion enhancement in minimal or mild background parenchyma enhancement on CEDM indicates low risk of breast malignancy (NPV = 100%)."

The purpose of this study was to correlate MGMT promoter methylation status changes with DWI and DSC PWI features in patients with recurrent glioblastoma after standard treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2008 and November 2016, forty patients with histologically confirmed recurrent glioblastoma were enrolled. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the MGMT promoter methylation status for the initial and recurrent tumors: 2 groups whose MGMT promoter methylation status remained, group methylated (n = 13) or group unmethylated (n = 18), and 1 group whose MGMT promoter methylation status changed from methylated to unmethylated (n = 9). Normalized ADC and normalized relative CBV values were obtained from both the enhancing and nonenhancing regions, from which histogram parameters were calculated. The ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post hoc tests were performed to compare histogram parameters among the 3 groups. The t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare parameters between group methylated and group methylated to unmethylated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to measure the predictive performance of the normalized relative CBV values between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Group methylated to unmethylated showed significantly higher means and 90th and 95th percentiles of the cumulative normalized relative CBV values of the nonenhancing region of the initial tumor than group methylated and group unmethylated (all P < .05). The mean normalized relative CBV value of the nonenhancing region of the initial tumor was the best predictor of methylation status change (P < .001), with a sensitivity of 77.78% and specificity of 92.31% at a cutoff value of 2.594. CONCLUSIONS: MGMT promoter methylation status might change in recurrent glioblastoma after standard treatment. The normalized relative CBV values of the nonenhancing region at the first preoperative MR imaging were higher in the MGMT promoter methylation change group from methylation to unmethylation in recurrent glioblastoma."

To explicitly mimic how human pathologists combine multi-scale information, we introduce a family of multi-encoder fully-convolutional neural networks with deep fusion. We present a simple block for merging model paths with differing spatial scales in a spatial relationship-preserving fashion, which can readily be included in standard encoder-decoder networks. Additionally, a context classification gate block is proposed as an alternative for the incorporation of global context. Our experiments were performed on three publicly available whole-slide images of recent challenges (PAIP 2019: hepatocellular carcinoma segmentation; BACH 2020: breast cancer segmentation; CAMELYON 2016: metastasis detection in lymph nodes). The multi-scale architectures consistently outperformed the baseline single-scale U-Nets by a large margin. They benefit from local as well as global context and particularly a combination of both. If feature maps from different scales are fused, doing so in a manner preserving spatial relationships was found to be beneficial. Deep guidance by a context classification loss appeared to improve model training at low computational costs. All multi-scale models had a reduced GPU memory footprint compared to ensembles of individual U-Nets trained on different image scales. Additional path fusions were shown to be possible at low computational cost, opening up possibilities for further, systematic and task-specific architecture optimisation. The findings demonstrate the potential of the presented family of human-inspired, end-to-end trainable, multi-scale multi-encoder fully-convolutional neural networks to improve deep histopathologic diagnosis by extensive integration of largely different spatial scales."

As an ultimate solution, one might even train a deep network from scratch with the domain-relevant images, a highly desirable option which is generally impeded in pathology by lack of labeled images and the computational expense. In this study, we propose a new network, namely KimiaNet, that employs the topology of the DenseNet with four dense blocks, fine-tuned and trained with histopathology images in different configurations. We used more than 240,000 image patches with 1000x1000 pixels acquired at 20x magnification through our proposed ""high-cellularity mosaic"" approach to enable the usage of weak labels of 7126 whole slide images of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human pathology samples publicly available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository. We tested KimiaNet using three public datasets, namely TCGA, endometrial cancer images, and colorectal cancer images by evaluating the performance of search and classification when corresponding features of different networks are used for image representation. As well, we designed and trained multiple convolutional batch-normalized ReLU (CBR) networks. The results show that KimiaNet provides superior results compared to the original DenseNet and smaller CBR networks when used as feature extractor to represent histopathology images."

However, interrater variability has been reported, and the whole-slide histopathology images likely contain underutilized biological signals predictive of genomic profiles. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To address this knowledge gap, we obtained whole-slide histopathology images and demographic, genomic, and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, and Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA) to develop computational methods for integrating data analyses. Leveraging these large and diverse datasets, we developed fully automated convolutional neural networks to diagnose renal cancers and connect quantitative pathology patterns with patients' genomic profiles and prognoses. RESULTS: Our deep convolutional neural networks successfully detected malignancy (AUC in the independent validation cohort: 0.964-0.985), diagnosed RCC histologic subtypes (independent validation AUCs of the best models: 0.953-0.993), and predicted stage I ccRCC patients' survival outcomes (log-rank test P = 0.02). Our machine learning approaches further identified histopathology image features indicative of copy-number alterations (AUC > 0.7 in multiple genes in patients with ccRCC) and tumor mutation burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that convolutional neural networks can extract histologic signals predictive of patients' diagnoses, prognoses, and genomic variations of clinical importance. Our approaches can systematically identify previously unknown relations among diverse data modalities."

We have engineered a SHielded, REtargeted ADenovirus (SHREAD) gene therapy platform that targets specific cells based on chosen surface markers and converts them into biofactories secreting therapeutics. In a proof of concept, a clinically approved antibody is delivered to orthotopic tumors in a model system in which precise biodistribution can be determined using tissue clearing with passive CLARITY technique (PACT) with high-resolution three-dimensional imaging and feature quantification within the tumors made transparent. We demonstrate high levels of tumor cell-specific transduction and significant and durable antibody production. PACT gives a localized quantification of the secreted therapeutic and allows us to directly observe enhanced pore formation in the tumor and destruction of the intact vasculature. In situ production of the antibody led to an 1,800-fold enhanced tumor-to-serum antibody concentration ratio compared to direct administration. Our detailed biochemical and microscopic analyses thus show that paracrine delivery with SHREAD could enable the use of highly potent therapeutic combinations, including those with systemic toxicity, to reach adequate therapeutic windows."

The desired information consists of cell-specific time series of pixel intensity values, in which the fluorescence intensity represents cellular activity. For static scenes, cellular signal extraction is straightforward, however multiple analysis challenges are present in recordings of contractile tissues, like those of the enteric nervous system (ENS). This layer of critical neurons, embedded within the muscle layers of the gut wall, shows optical overlap between neighboring neurons, intensity changes due to cell activity, and constant movement. These challenges reduce the applicability of classical segmentation techniques and traditional stack alignment and regions-of-interest (ROIs) selection workflows. Therefore, a signal extraction method capable of dealing with moving cells and is insensitive to large intensity changes in consecutive frames is needed. Here we propose a b-spline active contour method to delineate and track neuronal cell bodies based on local and global energy terms. We develop both a single as well as a double-contour approach. The latter takes advantage of the appearance of GCaMP expressing cells, and tracks the nucleus' boundaries together with the cytoplasmic contour, providing a stable delineation of neighboring, overlapping cells despite movement and intensity changes. The tracked contours can also serve as landmarks to relocate additional and manually-selected ROIs. This improves the total yield of efficacious cell tracking and allows signal extraction from other cell compartments like neuronal processes. Compared to manual delineation and other segmentation methods, the proposed method can track cells during large tissue deformations and high-intensity changes such as during neuronal firing events, while preserving the shape of the extracted Ca(2+) signal. The analysis package represents a significant improvement to available Ca(2+) imaging analysis workflows for ENS recordings and other systems where movement challenges traditional Ca(2+) signal extraction workflows."

To overcome various complexities associated with the existing analytical techniques for analyzing aggregates in serum, a novel florescence microscopy-based image processing approach was developed. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) was tagged with a fluorescent dye, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Aggregates, generated by stirring, were spiked into serum and images were captured at various time points. After denoising, thresholding by weighted median, 1D Otsu, and 2D Otsu was attempted and a modified 2D Otsu, a new mode of thresholding, was developed. This thresholding method was found to be highly effective in removing noises and retaining analyte sizes. Out of 0-255, the optimized threshold value obtained for the images discussed in modified 2D Otsu was 9 while 2D Otsu's overestimated values were 38 and 48. Other morphological operations were applied after thresholding and the area, perimeter, circularity, and radii of the aggregates in these images were calculated. The proposed algorithm offers an approach for analysis of aggregates in serum that is simpler to implement and is complementary to existing approaches."

There is a major clinical need to develop computational methods enabling clinicians to translate heterogeneous biomedical images into accurate and quantitative diagnostics. This need is particularly salient with small bowel enteropathies; environmental enteropathy (EE) and celiac disease (CD). We built upon our preliminary analysis by developing an artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis platform utilizing deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for these enteropathies. METHODS: Data for the secondary analysis was obtained from three primary studies at different sites. The image analysis platform for EE and CD was developed using CNNs including one with multizoom architecture. Gradient-weighted class activation mappings (Grad-CAMs) were used to visualize the models' decision-making process for classifying each disease. A team of medical experts simultaneously reviewed the stain color normalized images done for bias reduction and Grad-CAMs to confirm structural preservation and biomedical relevance, respectively. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-one high-resolution biopsy images from 150 children were acquired. Median age (interquartile range) was 37.5 (19.0-121.5) months with a roughly equal sex distribution; 77 males (51.3%). ResNet50 and shallow CNN demonstrated 98% and 96% case-detection accuracy, respectively, which increased to 98.3% with an ensemble. Grad-CAMs demonstrated models' ability to learn different microscopic morphological features for EE, CD, and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our AI-based image analysis platform demonstrated high classification accuracy for small bowel enteropathies which was capable of identifying biologically relevant microscopic features and emulating human pathologist decision-making process. Grad-CAMs illuminated the otherwise ""black box"" of deep learning in medicine, allowing for increased physician confidence in adopting these new technologies in clinical practice."

Epub 2021 Mar 5.,Di L,World Neurosurg,2021,2021/03/08,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2021.02.122,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis traditionally involves frozen section histopathology, which may be labor and time intensive. Indeed, a technique that streamlines the acquisition and evaluation of intraoperative histologic data may expedite surgical decision-making and shorten operative time. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) is an emerging technology that allows for more rapid acquisition and interpretation of intraoperative histopathologic data. METHODS: A blinded, prospective cohort study was performed for 82 patients undergoing resection for a central nervous system tumor. Of these, 21 patients were diagnosed with glioma either intraoperatively or postoperatively on permanent section histology and included in this study. Time to diagnosis (TTD) and diagnostic accuracy relative to permanent section (the gold standard) were compared between SRH-based diagnosis and conventional frozen section histology. Diagnostic concordance with permanent section was also compared between frozen histopathology and SRH diagnosis. RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy was not significantly different between methods (P = 1.00). Diagnostic concordance was not significantly different between methods when comparing 95% confidence intervals for kappa values (kappa = 0.215; kappa = 0.297; kappa = 0.369). Lastly, mean TTD was significantly shorter with SRH-based diagnosis compared with frozen section (43 vs. 9.7 minutes, P < 0.0001). SRH was able to identify key features associated with varying glioma types. CONCLUSIONS: SRH allows for rapid intraoperative diagnosis without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. SRH may serve as a promising adjuvant to conventional histopathology to expedite intraoperative pathology consultation and surgical decision-making."

The accuracy hereby depends on many factors, including the spatial resolution of the imaging technique. 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of nerve fiber tracts in whole brain sections with micrometer in-plane resolution, but leaves uncertainties in pixels containing crossing fibers. Here we introduce Scattered Light Imaging (SLI) to resolve the substructure of nerve fiber crossings. The measurement is performed on the same unstained histological brain sections as in 3D-PLI. By illuminating the brain sections from different angles and measuring the transmitted (scattered) light under normal incidence, light intensity profiles are obtained that are characteristic for the underlying brain tissue structure. We have developed a fully automated evaluation of the intensity profiles, allowing the user to extract various characteristics, like the individual directions of in-plane crossing nerve fibers, for each image pixel at once. We validate the reconstructed nerve fiber directions against results from previous simulation studies, scatterometry measurements, and fiber directions obtained from 3D-PLI. We demonstrate in different brain samples (human optic tracts, vervet monkey brain, rat brain) that the 2D fiber directions can be reliably reconstructed for up to three crossing nerve fiber bundles in each image pixel with an in-plane resolution of up to 6.5 mum. We show that SLI also yields reliable fiber directions in brain regions with low 3D-PLI signals coming from regions with a low density of myelinated nerve fibers or out-of-plane fibers. This makes Scattered Light Imaging a promising new imaging technique, providing crucial information about the organization of crossing nerve fibers in the brain."

Manual foci quantification by eye is well-established but unsatisfactory due to inconsistent foci numbers between different observers, lack of information about foci size and intensity and the time-consuming scoring process. Therefore, automated foci counting is an important goal. Several software solutions for automated foci counting in separately acquired fluorescence microscopy images have been established. The AKLIDES NUK technology by Medipan combines automated microscopy and image processing/ counting, enabling affordable high throughput foci analysis as a routine application. Using this machine, automated foci counting is well established for lymphocytes but has not yet been reported for adherent tumor cells with their irregularly shaped nuclei and heterogeneous foci textures. Here we aimed to use the AKLIDES NUK system for adherent tumor cells growing in clusters. We identified cell separation as a critical step to ensure fast and reliable automated nuclei detection. We validated our protocol for the fully automated quantification of (i) the IR-dose dependent increase and (ii) the ATM as well as PARP inhibitor-induced radiosensitization. Collectively, with this protocol the AKLIDES NUK system facilitates cost effective, fast and high throughput quantitative fluorescence microscopic analysis of DNA damage induced foci such as gammaH2AX and 53BP1 in adherent tumor cells."

Thus, there is a critical need for improved tools to assess liver pathology in order to risk stratify NASH patients and monitor treatment response. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Here, we describe a machine learning (ML)-based approach to liver histology assessment, which accurately characterizes disease severity and heterogeneity, and sensitively quantifies treatment response in NASH. We use samples from three randomized controlled trials to build and then validate deep convolutional neural networks to measure key histological features in NASH, including steatosis, inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis. The ML-based predictions showed strong correlations with expert pathologists and were prognostic of progression to cirrhosis and liver-related clinical events. We developed a heterogeneity-sensitive metric of fibrosis response, the Deep Learning Treatment Assessment Liver Fibrosis score, which measured antifibrotic treatment effects that went undetected by manual pathological staging and was concordant with histological disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our ML method has shown reproducibility and sensitivity and was prognostic for disease progression, demonstrating the power of ML to advance our understanding of disease heterogeneity in NASH, risk stratify affected patients, and facilitate the development of therapies."

U-Net is well-liked in medical image segmentation, but it doesn't fully explore useful features of the channel and capitalize on the contextual information. Therefore, we present an improved U-Net with residual connections, adding a plug-and-play, very portable channel attention (CA) block and a hybrid dilated attention convolutional (HDAC) layer to perform medical image segmentation for different tasks accurately and effectively, and call it HDA-ResUNet, in which we fully utilize advantages of U-Net, attention mechanism and dilated convolution. In contrast to the simple copy splicing of U-Net in the skip connection, the channel attention block is inserted into the extracted feature map of the encoding path before decoding operation. Since this block is lightweight, we can apply it to multiple layers in the backbone network to optimize the channel effect of this layer's coding operation. In addition, the convolutional layer at the bottom of the ""U""-shaped network is replaced by a hybrid dilated attention convolutional (HDAC) layer to fuse information from different sizes of receptive fields. The proposed HDA-ResUNet is evaluated on four datasets: liver and tumor segmentation (LiTS 2017), lung segmentation (Lung dataset), nuclear segmentation in microscope images (DSB 2018) and neuron structure segmentation (ISBI 2012). The dice global scores of liver and tumor segmentation (LiTS 2017) reach 0.949 and 0.799. The dice coefficients of lung segmentation and nuclear segmentation are 0.9797 and 0.9081 respectively, and the information theoretic score for the last one is 0.9703. The segmentation results are all more accurate than U-Net with fewer parameters, and the problem of slow convergence speed of U-Net on DBS 2018 is solved."

The traditional method consists of two stages: (1) performing instance object segmentation of each frame, and (2) associating objects frame-by-frame. Recently, pixel-embedding-based deep learning approaches these two steps simultaneously as a single stage holistic solution. Pixel-embedding-based learning forces similar feature representation of pixels from the same object, while maximizing the difference of feature representations from different objects. However, such deep learning methods require consistent annotations not only spatially (for segmentation), but also temporally (for tracking). In computer vision, annotated training data with consistent segmentation and tracking is resource intensive, the severity of which is multiplied in microscopy imaging due to (1) dense objects (e.g., overlapping or touching), and (2) high dynamics (e.g., irregular motion and mitosis). Adversarial simulations have provided successful solutions to alleviate the lack of such annotations in dynamics scenes in computer vision, such as using simulated environments (e.g., computer games) to train real-world self-driving systems. METHODS: In this paper, we propose an annotation-free synthetic instance segmentation and tracking (ASIST) method with adversarial simulation and single-stage pixel-embedding based learning. CONTRIBUTION: The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) the proposed method aggregates adversarial simulations and single-stage pixel-embedding based deep learning (2) the method is assessed with both the cellular (i.e., HeLa cells); and subcellular (i.e., microvilli) objects; and (3) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore annotation-free instance segmentation and tracking study for microscope videos. RESULTS: The ASIST method achieved an important step forward, when compared with fully supervised approaches: ASIST shows 7%-11% higher segmentation, detection and tracking performance on microvilli relative to fully supervised methods, and comparable performance on Hela cell videos."

Here, the time-frequency time-space long short-term memory network (TF-TS LSTM) developed for classification of time series is applied for classifying histopathological images. The deep learning is empowered by the use of sequential time-frequency and time-space features extracted from the images. Furthermore, unlike conventional classification practice, a strategy for class modeling is designed to leverage the learning power of the TF-TS LSTM. Tests on several datasets of histopathological images of haematoxylin-and-eosin and immunohistochemistry stains demonstrate the strong capability of the artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach for producing very accurate classification results.

However, synthesizing medical images using CycleGAN can lead to misdiagnosis of a medical condition as it might hallucinate unwanted features, especially if theres a data bias. This can potentially change the original class of the input image, which is a very serious problem. In this paper, we have introduced a modified distribution matching loss for CycleGAN to eliminate feature hallucination on the malaria dataset. In the context of the malaria dataset, unintentional feature hallucination may introduce a facet that resembles a parasite or remove the parasite after the translation. Our proposed approach has enabled us to shift the domain of the malaria dataset without the risk of changing their corresponding class. We have presented experimental evidence that our modified loss significantly reduced feature hallucination by preserving original class labels. The experimental results are better in comparison to the baseline (classic CycleGAN) that targets the translating domain. We believe that our approach will expedite the process of developing unsupervised unpaired GAN that is safe for clinical use."

We have developed a novel artificial neural network (ANN) based approach for tumor collagen segmentation from bright-field histology images and have tested it on a set of tissue microarray sections from early hormone receptor-positive invasive ductal breast carcinoma stained with Sirius Red (1 core per patient, n = 92). We designed and trained ANNs on sets of differently annotated image patches to segment collagen fibers and extracted 37 features of collagen fiber morphometry, density, orientation, texture, and fractal characteristics in the entire cohort. Independent instances of ANN models trained on highly differing annotations produced reasonably concordant collagen segmentation masks and allowed reliable prognostic Cox regression models (with likelihood ratios 14.11-22.99, at p-value < 0.05) superior to conventional clinical parameters (size of the primary tumor (T), regional lymph node status (N), histological grade (G), and patient age). Additionally, we noted statistically significant differences of collagen features between tumor grade groups, and the factor analysis revealed features resembling the TACS concept. Our proposed method offers collagen framework segmentation from bright-field histology images and provides novel image-based features for better breast cancer patient prognostication."

Precise histopathological classification of CRC tissue pathology is the cornerstone not only for diagnosis but also for patients' management decision making. An automated system able to accurately classify different CRC tissue regions may increase diagnostic precision and alleviate clinical workload. However, tissue classification is a challenging task due to the variability in morphological and textural characteristics present in histopathology images. In this study, an artificial neural network was trained to classify between eight classes of CRC tissue image patches derived from a public dataset with 5000 CRC histopathology image tiles. A total of 532 multi-level pathomics features examined at different scales were extracted by visual descriptors such as local binary patterns, wavelet transforms and Gabor filters. An exhaustive evaluation involving a variety of wavelet families and parameters was performed in order to shed light on the impact of scale on pathomics based CRC tissue differentiation. Our model achieved a performance accuracy of 95.3% with tenfold cross validation demonstrating superior performance compared to 87.4% reported in recent studies. Furthermore, we experimentally showed that the first and the second levels of the wavelet approximations can be used without compromising classification performance."

Epub 2021 Aug 5.,Lv M,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,2021,2021/01/12,,,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3050483,"The traditional differential diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) mainly relies on clinical symptoms, serological examination and optical renal biopsy. However, there is a probability of false positives in the optical inspection results, and it is unable to detect the change of biochemical components, which poses an obstacle to pathogenic mechanism analysis. Microscopic hyperspectral imaging can reveal detailed component information of immune complexes, but the high dimensionality of microscopic hyperspectral image brings difficulties and challenges to image processing and disease diagnosis. In this paper, a novel classification framework, including spatial-spectral density peaks-based discriminant analysis (SSDP), is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of MN using a microscopic hyperspectral pathological dataset. SSDP constructs a set of graphs describing intrinsic structure of MHSI in both spatial and spectral domains by employing density peak clustering. In the process of graph embedding, low-dimensional features with important diagnostic information in the immune complex are obtained by compacting the spatial-spectral local intra-class pixels while separating the spectral inter-class pixels. For the MN recognition task, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify pixels in the low-dimensional space. Experimental validation data employ two types of MN that are difficult to distinguish with optical microscope, including primary MN and hepatitis B virus-associated MN. Experimental results show that the proposed SSDP achieves a sensitivity of 99.36%, which has potential clinical value for automatic diagnosis of MN."

The commonly used diagnostic method, 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear microscopy, makes it not very easy to recognize fungi. METHODS: Vaginal secretions were collected from clinically suspected VVC patients and divided into four groups and examined using KOH, CFW (Calcofluor White), FB 85(fluorescent brightener 85), and culture. The data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 110 patients with suspected VVC were recruited. The positive rates of KOH, CFW, FB 85, and the culture method were 68.2%, 64.5%, 61.8%, and 77%, respectively. According to the McNemar test, there was no statistically significant difference between the KOH, CFW, and the FB 85 methods (p > 0.05). However, CFW had a shorter diagnosis time than the KOH method and had a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). Moreover, CFW has the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. In morphological recognition, it was easier to recognize fungal structures with CFW and FB 85 than with the KOH. CONCLUSIONS: The fluorescent method is a good method for the diagnosis of VVC.

Over the years ImageJ has been substantially extended to support novel applications in scientific imaging as they emerge, particularly in the area of biological microscopy, with functionality made more accessible via the Fiji distribution of ImageJ. Within this software ecosystem, work has been done to extend the accessibility of ImageJ to utilize scripting, macros, and plugins in a variety of programming scenarios, e.g., from Groovy and Python and in Jupyter notebooks and cloud computing. We provide five protocols that demonstrate the extensibility of ImageJ for various workflows in image processing. We focus first on Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) data, since this requires significant processing to provide quantitative insights into the microenvironments of cells. Second, we show how ImageJ can now be utilized for common image processing techniques, specifically image deconvolution and inversion, while highlighting the new, built-in features of ImageJ-particularly its capacity to run completely headless and the Ops matching feature that selects the optimal algorithm for a given function and data input, thereby enabling processing speedup.

MAPT mutations are associated with abnormal tau phosphorylation levels and accumulation of misfolded tau protein that can propagate between neurons ultimately leading to cell death (tauopathy). Recently, a p.A152T tau variant was identified as a risk factor for FTD, Alzheimer's disease, and synucleinopathies. Here we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from a patient carrying this p.A152T variant to create a robust, functional cellular assay system for probing pathophysiological tau accumulation and phosphorylation. Using stably transduced iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells engineered to enable inducible expression of the pro-neural transcription factor Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2), we generated disease-relevant, cortical-like glutamatergic neurons in a scalable, high-throughput screening compatible format. Utilizing automated confocal microscopy, and an advanced image-processing pipeline optimized for analysis of morphologically complex human neuronal cultures, we report quantitative, subcellular localization-specific effects of multiple kinase inhibitors on tau, including ones under clinical investigation not previously reported to affect tau phosphorylation. These results demonstrate the potential for using patient iPSC-derived ex vivo models of tauopathy as genetically accurate, disease-relevant systems to probe tau biochemistry and support the discovery of novel therapeutics for tauopathies."

However, the hierarchical organization of macroscopic brain morphology and how it constrains cortical function along the organizing axes remains unclear. We map the gradient of cortical morphometric similarity (MS) connectome, combining multiple features conceptualized as a ""fingerprint"" of an individual's brain. The principal MS gradient is anchored by motor and sensory cortices at two extreme ends, which are reliable and reproducible. Notably, divergences between motor and sensory hierarchies are consistent with the laminar histological thickness gradient but contrary to the canonical functional connectivity (FC) gradient. Moreover, the MS dissociates with FC gradients in the higher-order association cortices. The MS gradient recapitulates fundamental properties of cortical organization, from gene expression and cyto- and myeloarchitecture to evolutionary expansion. Collectively, our findings provide a heuristic hierarchical organization of cortical morphological neuromarkers."

METHODS: This four-step framework consists of: 1) approximate rigid registration, 2) cell and anatomical structure segmentation 3) fusion of information from different stainings using a newly developed registration algorithm 4) feature extraction. RESULTS: Each step of the framework is validated independently both quantitatively and qualitatively by pathologists. An illustration of the different types of features that can be extracted is presented. CONCLUSION: The proposed generic framework allows for the analysis of the micro-environment surrounding large structures that can be segmented (either manually or automatically). It is independent of the segmentation approach and is therefore applicable to a variety of biomedical research questions. SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic tissue remodelling processes after kidney transplantation can result in interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) and glomerulosclerosis. This pipeline provides tools to quantitatively analyse, in the same spatial context, information from different consecutive WSIs and help researchers understand the complex underlying mechanisms leading to IFTA and glomerulosclerosis."

The aim of our study is to systematically quantify and minimize uncertainty in output of computer based pathology image analysis. METHODS: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis (SA) methods, such as Variance-Based Decomposition (VBD) and Morris One-At-a-Time (MOAT), are employed to track and quantify uncertainty in a real-world application with large Whole Slide Imaging datasets - 943 Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) and 381 Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) patients. Because these studies are compute intensive, high-performance computing systems and efficient UQ/SA methods were combined to provide efficient execution. UQ/SA has been able to highlight parameters of the application that impact the results, as well as nuclear features that carry most of the uncertainty. Using this information, we built a method for selecting stable features that minimize application output uncertainty. RESULTS: The results show that input parameter variations significantly impact all stages (segmentation, feature computation, and survival analysis) of the use case application. We then identified and classified features according to their robustness to parameter variation, and using the proposed features selection strategy, for instance, patient grouping stability in survival analysis has been improved from in 17% and 34% for BRCA and LUSC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy created more robust analyses, demonstrating that SA and UQ are important methods that may increase confidence digital pathology."

The aim of this research was to compare the utility of various open-source and commercial image analysis methods, to quantify mRNA transcripts identified by RNAscope within formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) histological samples and cell monolayer preparations. Examination of MLH1 expression from 10 histological FFPE colorectal cancer specimens using four image analysis tools (Colour Deconvolution, SpotStudio, WEKA and the LEICA RNA-ISH algorithm) showed the WEKA tool as having the greatest level of agreement with manual quantification. Comparing image analysis methods to qRT-PCR for quantifying MLH1, GFI1 and TNFRSF11A expression within two colorectal cell lines results suggest that these image analysis methods perform at a similar level to qRT-PCR. Furthermore, we describe the strengths and limitations for each image analysis method when used in combination with RNAscope assays. Our study concludes that there are several freely available and commercial image analysis tools that enable reliable RNA in situ expression analysis, however operators need to consider factors, such as expected expression levels of target genes, software usability and functionality."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the surgical outcomes of APA patients based on the functional pathological diagnosis of APA according to HISTALDO (histopathology of primary aldosteronism) consensus. METHODS: Clinical data of 137 patients with suspected APA were analyzed retrospectively. All patients had hypertension and spontaneous hypokalemia. In all patients, CT showed a unilateral solitary hypodense adrenal lesion, and a contralateral adrenal gland of normal morphology. Tumors were removed and immunostained for CYP11B2, and their pathology were identified based on HISTALDO consensus. Patients were followed up 6 to 24 months after operation. RESULTS: Among 137 cases of presumptive APA diagnosed by CT, 130 (95%) cases were pathologically diagnosed with classical pathology, including 123 APA(90%) and 7 aldosterone-producing nodule (APN) (5%). 7 cases (5%) had non-functioning adenoma (NFA) with aldosterone-producing micronodule (APM) or multiple aldosterone-producing micronodule (MAPM) in the surrounding adrenal tissue. In all 137 patients, hypertension was complete or partial clinical success postoperatively. Complete clinical success was achieved in 73 (53%), and partial clinical success was achieved in 64 (47%) cases. Serum potassium level recovered to normal in all. In 123 patients with APA, complete clinical success was reached in 67 (54%), and partial clinical success was reached in 56 (46%) cases. Gender, duration of hypertension and the highest SBP were significant independent predictors for cure of APA after surgery. A multiple logistic regression model integrating the three predictors was constructed to predict the outcome, which achieved a sensitivity of 72.4% and a specificity of 73.1%. CONCLUSION: The specificity of CT in the diagnosis of APA and APN patients with hypokalemia was 95%. All patients achieved complete or partial clinical success after surgery. Gender, duration of hypertension and the highest SBP were independent predictors for the postoperative cure of APA."

This organelle is of particular interest to biologists, as its dysfunction is associated with numerous diseases, which often manifest themselves as changes to the structure and organisation of the reticular network. Due to its complex morphology, image analysis methods to quantitatively describe this organelle, and importantly any changes to it, are lacking. RESULTS: In this work we detail a methodological approach that utilises automated high-content screening microscopy to capture images of cells fluorescently-labelled for various ER markers, followed by their quantitative analysis. We propose that two key metrics, namely the area of dense ER and the area of polygonal regions in between the reticular elements, together provide a basis for measuring the quantities of rough and smooth ER, respectively. We demonstrate that a number of different pharmacological perturbations to the ER can be quantitatively measured and compared in our automated image analysis pipeline. Furthermore, we show that this method can be implemented in both commercial and open-access image analysis software with comparable results. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that this method has the potential to be applied in the context of large-scale genetic and chemical perturbations to assess the organisation of the ER in adherent cell cultures."

Increased tumor stiffness has traditionally provided a viable metric to screen for malignancies via palpation or imaging. Previous studies have demonstrated that the microscale mechanical properties of the cell substrate influence tumor proliferation and invasive migration in vitro. Nevertheless, the association of the mechanical microenvironment with clinical hallmarks of aggressiveness in human breast tumors, including histopathological subtype, grade, receptor expression status, and lymph node involvement is poorly understood. This is largely due to the lack of tools for mapping tumor viscoelastic properties in clinical specimens with high spatial resolution over a large field of view (FoV). Here we introduce laser Speckle rHEologicAl micRoscopy (SHEAR) that for the first time enables mapping the magnitude viscoelastic or shear modulus, |G*(x,y,omega)|, over a range of frequencies (omega = 1-250 rad/second) in excised tumors within minutes with a spatial resolution of approximately 50 mum, over multiple cm(2) FoV. Application of SHEAR in a cohort of 251 breast cancer specimens from 148 patients demonstrated that |G*(x,y,omega)| (omega = 2pi rad/second) closely corresponds with histological features of the tumor, and that the spatial gradient of the shear modulus, |nabla|G*(x,y,omega)||, is elevated at the tumor invasive front. Multivariate analyses established that the metrics, (|G* |) and (|nabla|G* ||), measured by SHEAR are associated with prognosis. These findings implicate the viscoelastic properties of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer prognosis and likely pave the path for identifying new modifiable targets for treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Laser speckle rheological microscopy establishes the links between microscale heterogeneities of viscoelasticity and histopathological subtype, tumor grade, receptor expression, as well as lymph node status in breast carcinoma."

The American Joint Committee on Cancer recommends reporting the number of mitotic figures (MFs) in a 1-mm2 area encompassing the ""hot spot."" There is currently no standard procedure for delineating a 1-mm2 region of interest for MF counting on a digital whole slide image (WSI) of melanoma. OBJECTIVE.-: To establish a standardized method to enclose a 1-mm2 region of interest for MF counting in melanoma based on WSIs and assess the method's effectiveness. DESIGN.-: Whole slide images were visualized using the ImageScope viewer (Aperio). Different monitors and viewing magnifications were explored and the annotation tools provided by ImageScope were evaluated. For validation, we compared mitotic rates obtained from WSIs with our method and those from glass slides with traditional microscopy with 30 melanoma cases. RESULTS.-: Of the monitors we examined, a 32-inch monitor with 3840 x 2160 resolution was optimal for counting MFs within a 1-mm2 region of interest in melanoma. When WSIs were viewed in the ImageScope viewer, x10 to x20 magnification during screening could efficiently locate a hot spot and x20 to x40 magnification during counting could accurately identify MFs. Fixed-shape annotations with 500 x 500-mum squares or circles can precisely and efficiently enclose a 1-mm2 region of interest. Our method on WSIs was able to produce a higher mitotic rate than with glass slides. CONCLUSIONS.-: Whole slide images may be used to efficiently count MFs. We recommend fixed-shape annotation with 500 x 500-mum squares or circles for routine practice in counting MFs for melanoma."

Epub 2021 Oct 5.,Zhao Z,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,2021,2021/01/18,,,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3052320,"Image segmentation is one of the most essential biomedical image processing problems for different imaging modalities, including microscopy and X-ray in the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) domain. However, annotating biomedical images is knowledge-driven, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, making it difficult to obtain abundant labels with limited costs. Active learning strategies come into ease the burden of human annotation, which queries only a subset of training data for annotation. Despite receiving attention, most of active learning methods still require huge computational costs and utilize unlabeled data inefficiently. They also tend to ignore the intermediate knowledge within networks. In this work, we propose a deep active semi-supervised learning framework, DSAL, combining active learning and semi-supervised learning strategies. In DSAL, a new criterion based on deep supervision mechanism is proposed to select informative samples with high uncertainties and low uncertainties for strong labelers and weak labelers respectively. The internal criterion leverages the disagreement of intermediate features within the deep learning network for active sample selection, which subsequently reduces the computational costs. We use the proposed criteria to select samples for strong and weak labelers to produce oracle labels and pseudo labels simultaneously at each active learning iteration in an ensemble learning manner, which can be examined with IoMT Platform. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art active learning methods."

Studies using uniform histological material have shown promise. Generalised application requires validation on slides from multiple institutions. We used machine learning to identify glomeruli on renal biopsies and compared performance between single and multiple institutions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomly selected, adequately sampled renal core biopsy cases (71) consisting of four stains each (haematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, silver, periodic acid Schiff) from three institutions were digitised at x40. Glomeruli were manually annotated by three renal pathologists using a digital tool. Cases were divided into training/validation (n = 52) and evaluation (n = 19) cohorts. An algorithm was trained to develop three convolutional neural network (CNN) models which tested case cohorts intra- and inter-institutionally. Raw CNN search data from each of the four slides per case were merged into composite regions of interest containing putative glomeruli. The sensitivity and modified specificity of glomerulus detection (versus annotated truth) were calculated for each model/cohort. Intra-institutional (3) sensitivity ranged from 90 to 93%, with modified specificity from 86 to 98%. Interinstitutional (1) sensitivity was 77%, with modified specificity 97%. Combined intra- and inter-institutional (1) sensitivity was 86%, with modified specificity 92%. CONCLUSIONS: Feature detection sensitivity degrades when training and test material originate from different sites. Training using a combined set of digital slides from three institutions improves performance. Differing histology methods probably account for algorithm performance contrasts. Our data highlight the need for diverse training sets for the development of generalisable machine learning histology algorithms."

Morphologic patterns observable in histopathology sections from tumors are determined by the underlying molecular phenotype and therefore have the potential to be exploited for prediction of molecular phenotypes. We report here the first transcriptome-wide expression-morphology (EMO) analysis in breast cancer, where individual deep convolutional neural networks were optimized and validated for prediction of mRNA expression in 17,695 genes from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images. Predicted expressions in 9,334 (52.75%) genes were significantly associated with RNA sequencing estimates. We also demonstrated successful prediction of an mRNA-based proliferation score with established clinical value. The results were validated in independent internal and external test datasets. Predicted spatial intratumor variabilities in expression were validated through spatial transcriptomics profiling. These results suggest that EMO provides a cost-efficient and scalable approach to predict both tumor average and intratumor spatial expression from histopathology images. SIGNIFICANCE: Transcriptome-wide expression morphology deep learning analysis enables prediction of mRNA expression and proliferation markers from routine histopathology whole slide images in breast cancer."

Traditionally, it has been considered a categorical problem, ignoring the natural ordering among the cancer grades, i.e., the higher the grade is, the more aggressive it is, and the worse the outcome is. Herein, we propose a joint categorical and ordinal learning framework for cancer grading in pathology images. The approach simultaneously performs both categorical classification and ordinal classification and aims to leverage the distinctive features from the two tasks. Moreover, we propose a new loss function for the ordinal classification task that offers an improved contrast between the correctly classified examples and misclassified examples. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple collections of colorectal and prostate pathology images that underwent different acquisition and processing procedures. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the experimental results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in comparison to other competing methods. The results suggest that the proposed approach could permit improved histopathologic analysis of cancer grades in pathology images."

We have previously shown that immersion in cold formalin followed by heated formalin is beneficial for preservation of histomorphology and have combined two-temperature fixation with ultra-sensitive acoustic monitoring technology that can actively detect formalin diffusing into a tissue. Here we expand on our previous work by developing a predictive statistical model to determine when a tissue is properly diffused based on the real-time acoustic signal. We trained the model based on the morphology and characteristic diffusion curves of 30 tonsil cores. To test our model, a set of 87 different tonsil samples were fixed with four different protocols: dynamic fixation according to our predictive algorithm (C/H:Dynamic, N = 18), gold-standard 24 hour room temperature (RT:24hr, N = 24), 6 hours in cold formalin followed by 1 hour in heated formalin (C/H:6+1, N = 21), and 2 hours in cold formalin followed by 1 hour in heated formalin (C/H:2+1, N = 24). Digital pathology analysis revealed that the C/H:Dynamic samples had FOXP3 staining that was spatially uniform and statistically equivalent to RT:24hr and C/H:6+1 fixation protocols. For comparison, the intentionally underfixed C/H:2+1 samples had significantly suppressed FOXP3 staining (p<0.002). Furthermore, our dynamic fixation protocol produced bcl-2 staining concordant with standard fixation techniques. The dynamically fixed samples were on average only submerged in cold formalin for 4.2 hours, representing a significant workflow improvement. We have successfully demonstrated a first-of-its-kind analytical method to assess the quality of fixation in real-time and have confirmed its performance with quantitative analysis of downstream staining. This innovative technology could be used to ensure high-quality and standardized staining as part of an expedited and fully documented preanalytical workflow."

Through numerical simulation and biological experiments, we validated the accuracy of EVER in improving the fidelity of the reconstructed super-resolution image for a wide variety of imaging characteristics. EVER requires no manual adjustment of parameters and has been implemented as an easy-to-use ImageJ plugin that can immediately enhance the quality of reconstructed super-resolution images. This method is validated as an efficient way for robust nanoscale imaging of samples with heterogeneous background fluorescence, such as thicker tissue and cells."

In this study, we proposed a guide to optimize advanced light microscopy approaches by reducing light exposure through fluorescence lifetime (tau) exploitation of red/near-infrared dyes. Firstly, we characterized key instrumental elements which revealed that red/near-infrared laser lines with an 86x (Numerical Aperture (NA) = 1.2, water immersion) objective allowed high transmission of fluorescence signals, low irradiance and super-resolution. As a combination of two technologies, i.e., vacuum tubes (e.g., photomultiplier) and semiconductor microelectronics (e.g., avalanche photodiode), type S, X and R of hybrid detectors (HyD-S, HyD-X and HyD-R) were particularly adapted for red/near-infrared photon counting and tau separation. Secondly, we tested and compared lifetime-based imaging including coarse tau separation for confocal microscopy, fitting and phasor plot analysis for fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM), and lifetimes weighting for enhanced stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy, in light of red/near-infrared multiplexing. Mainly, we showed that the choice of appropriate imaging approach may depend on fluorochrome number, together with their spectral/lifetime characteristics and STED compatibility. Photon-counting mode and sensitivity of HyDs together with phasor plot analysis of fluorescence lifetimes enabled the flexible and fast imaging of multi-labeled living H28 cells. Therefore, a combination of red/near-infrared dyes labeling with lifetime-based strategies offers new perspectives for live-cell imaging by enhancing sample preservation through acquisition time and light exposure reduction."

From these images various cellular features can be extracted. Together these features form phenotypes that can be used to determine effective drug therapies, such as those based on nanomedicines. Unfortunately, fluorescence microscopy is time-consuming, expensive, labour intensive, and toxic to the cells. Bright-field images lack these downsides but also lack the clear contrast of the cellular components and hence are difficult to use for downstream analysis. Generating the fluorescence images directly from bright-field images using virtual staining (also known as ""label-free prediction"" and ""in-silico labeling"") can get the best of both worlds, but can be very challenging to do for poorly visible cellular structures in the bright-field images. To tackle this problem deep learning models were explored to learn the mapping between bright-field and fluorescence images for adipocyte cell images. The models were tailored for each imaging channel, paying particular attention to the various challenges in each case, and those with the highest fidelity in extracted cell-level features were selected. The solutions included utilizing privileged information for the nuclear channel, and using image gradient information and adversarial training for the lipids channel. The former resulted in better morphological and count features and the latter resulted in more faithfully captured defects in the lipids, which are key features required for downstream analysis of these channels."

It allows capturing detailed information about the morphology, gene expression, and spatial characteristics of individual cells at every time instance of the imaging experiment. The image analysis of bacterial ""single-cell movies"" (videos) generates big data in the form of multidimensional time series of measured bacterial attributes. If properly analyzed, these datasets can help us decipher the bacterial communities' growth dynamics and identify the sources and potential functional role of intra- and inter-subpopulation heterogeneity. Recent research has highlighted the importance of investigating the role of biological ""noise"" in gene regulation, cell growth, cell division, etc. Single-cell analytics of complex single-cell movie datasets, capturing the interaction of multiple micro-colonies with thousands of cells, can shed light on essential phenomena for human health, such as the competition of pathogens and benign microbiome cells, the emergence of dormant cells (""persisters""), the formation of biofilms under different stress conditions, etc. However, highly accurate and automated bacterial bioimage analysis and single-cell analytics methods remain elusive, even though they are required before we can routinely exploit the plethora of data that single-cell movies generate. RESULTS: We present visualization and single-cell analytics using R (ViSCAR), a set of methods and corresponding functions, to visually explore and correlate single-cell attributes generated from the image processing of complex bacterial single-cell movies. They can be used to model and visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of attributes at different levels of the microbial community organization (i.e., cell population, colony, generation, etc.), to discover possible epigenetic information transfer across cell generations, infer mathematical and statistical models describing various stochastic phenomena (e.g., cell growth, cell division), and even identify and auto-correct errors introduced unavoidably during the bioimage analysis of a dense movie with thousands of overcrowded cells in the microscope's field of view. CONCLUSIONS: ViSCAR empowers researchers to capture and characterize the stochasticity, uncover the mechanisms leading to cellular phenotypes of interest, and decipher a large heterogeneous microbial communities' dynamic behavior.

Epub 2021 Jun 17.,Terashima M,J Anat,2021,2021/06/18,PMC8546516,,10.1111/joa.13488,"The cortical plate (CP) first appears at seven postconceptional weeks (pcw), when it splits the preexisting preplate into two layers, the marginal zone and the presubplate (pSP). Although three-dimensional (3D) analysis using fetal magnetic resonance imaging and two-dimensional tissue observations have been reported, there have been no studies analyzing the early development of the layer structure corresponding to the pSP stage in 3D. Here, we reconstructed 3-D models of the brain with a focus on the cortical layers in pSP stage. To achieve this, we digitized serial tissue sections of embryos between CS20 and CS23 from the Kyoto Collection (n = 7, approximately 7-8.5 pcw), and specimens at early fetal phase from the Blechschmidt Collection (n = 2, approximately 9.5-12 pcw, crown rump length [CRL] 39 and 64 mm). We observed tissue sections and 3D images and performed quantitative analysis of the thickness, surface area, and volume. Because the boundary between pSP and the intermediate zone (IZ) could not be distinguished in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, the two layers were analyzed together as a single layer in this study. The histology of the layers was observed from CS21 and became distinct at CS22. Subsequently, we observed the 3-D models; pSP-IZ was present in a midlateral region of the cerebral wall at CS21, and an expansion centered around this region was observed after CS22. We observed it over the entire cerebral hemisphere at early fetal phase (CRL 39 mm). The thickness of pSP-IZ was visible in 3D and was greater in the midlateral region. At the end of the pSP stage (CRL 64 mm), the thick region expanded to lateral, superior, and posterior regions around the primordium of the insula. While, the region near the basal ganglia was not included in the thickest 10% of the pSP-IZ area. Middle cerebral artery was found in the midlateral region of the cerebral wall, near the area where pSP-IZ was observed. Feature of layer structure growth was revealed by quantitative assessment as thickness, surface area, and volume. The maximum thickness value of pSP-IZ and CP increased significantly according to CRL, whereas the median value increased slightly. The layer structure appeared to grow and spread thin, rather than thickening during early development, which is characteristic during pSP stages. The surface area of the cerebral total tissue, CP, and pSP-IZ increased in proportion to the square of CRL. The surface area of CP and pSP-IZ approached that of the total tissue at the end of the pSP stage. Volume of each layer increased in proportion to the cube of CRL. pSP-IZ and CP constituted over 50% of the total tissue in volume at the end of the pSP stages. We could visualize the growth of pSP-IZ in 3D and quantify it during pSP stage. Our approach allowed us to observe the process of rapid expansion of pSP-IZ from the midlateral regions of the cerebral wall, which subsequently becomes the insula."

However, existing methods for inducing angiogenesis utilize approaches that yield vasculature with poor temporal stability or inadequate mechanical integrity, which reduce their robustness in vivo. The transcription factor Ets variant 2 (Etv2) specifies embryonic hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cell (EC) development, and is transiently reactivated during postnatal vascular regeneration and tumor angiogenesis. This study investigates the role for Etv2 upregulation in forming stable vascular beds both in vitro and in vivo. Control and Etv2(+) prototypical fetal-derived human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and adult ECs were angiogenically grown into vascular beds. These vessel beds were characterized using fractal dimension and lacunarity, to quantify their branching complexity and space-filling homogeneity, respectively. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to explore whether greater complexity and homogeneity lead to more mechanically stable vessels. Additionally, markers of EC integrity were used to probe for mechanistic clues. Etv2(+) HUVECs exhibit greater branching, vessel density, and structural homogeneity, and decreased stiffness in vitro and in vivo, indicating a greater propensity for stable vessel formation. When co-cultured with colon tumor organoid tissue, Etv2(+) HUVECs had decreased fractal dimension and lacunarity compared to Etv2(+) HUVECs cultured alone, indicating that vessel density and homogeneity of vessel spacing increased due to the presence of Etv2. This study sets forth the novel concept that fractal dimension, lacunarity, and AFM are as informative as conventional angiogenic measurements, including vessel branching and density, to assess vascular perfusion and stability."

Non-invasive techniques such as mammograms and ultrasound imaging are used to detect the tumor. However, breast histopathological image analysis is inevitable for the detection of malignancy of the tumor. Manual analysis of breast histopathological images is subjective, tedious, laborious and is prone to human errors. Recent developments in computational power and memory have made automation a popular choice for the analysis of these images. One of the key challenges of breast histopathological image classification at 100x magnification is to extract the features of the potential regions of interest to decide on the malignancy of the tumor. The current state-of-the-art CNN based methods for breast histopathological image classification extract features from the entire image (global features) and thus may overlook the features of the potential regions of interest. This can lead to inaccurate diagnosis of breast histopathological images. This research gap has motivated us to propose BCHisto-Net to classify breast histopathological images at 100x magnification. The proposed BCHisto-Net extracts both global and local features required for the accurate classification of breast histopathological images. The global features extract abstract image features while local features focus on potential regions of interest. Furthermore, a feature aggregation branch is proposed to combine these features for the classification of 100x images. The proposed method is quantitatively evaluated on red a private dataset and publicly available BreakHis dataset. An extensive evaluation of the proposed model showed the effectiveness of the local and global features for the classification of these images. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 95% and 89% on KMC and BreakHis datasets respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art classifiers."

Microscope images of captured WBCs for processing and analysis are important to interpret the body condition. At present, there is no robust automated method to segment and classify WBCs images with high accuracy. This paper aims to improve on WBCs image segmentation and classification method. Methods A triple thresholding method was proposed to segment the WBCs; meanwhile, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classification model that adopts transfer learning technique was proposed to detect and classify WBCs as a healthy or a malignant. The input dataset of this research work is the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB). The process first converts the captured microscope images into HSV format for obtaining the H component. Otsu thresholding is applied to segment the WBC area. A 13 x 13 kernel with two iterations was used to apply morphological opening on image to ameliorate output results. Collected cell masks were used to detect the contour of each cell on the original image. To classify WBCs into a healthy or a malignant category, characteristics and conditions of WBCs are to be examined. A transfer learning technique and pre-trained InceptionV3 model were employed to extract the features from the images for classification. Results The proposed WBCs segmentation method yields 90.45% accuracy, 83.81% of the structural similarity index, 76.25% of the dice similarity coefficient, and is computationally efficient. The accuracy of fine-tuned classifier model for training, validation and test sets are 93.27%, 92.31% and 96.15% respectively. The obtained results are high in accuracy and precision are over 96% and with lower loss value. Discussion Triple thresholding outperforms K-means clustering in segmenting smaller dataset. Pre-trained InceptionV3 model and transfer learning improve the flexibility and ability of classifier."

The mitotic count is an important component in determining the severity of newborn jaundice. The use of principal component analysis (PCA) feature selection and an optimal tree strategy classifier to produce automatic mitotic detection in histopathology images and grading is given. This study makes use of real-time and benchmark datasets, as well as specific approaches for detecting jaundice in newborn newborns. According to research, the quality of the feature may have a negative impact on categorization performance. Additionally, compressing the classification method for exclusive main properties can result in a classification performance bottleneck. As a result, identifying appropriate characteristics for training the classifier is required. By combining a feature selection method with a classification model, this is possible. The major outcomes of this study revealed that image processing techniques are critical for predicting neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Image processing is a method of translating analogue images to digital formats and manipulating them. The primary goal of medical image processing is to collect information useful for disease detection, diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. Image datasets can be used to validate the performance of newborn jaundice detection. When compared to conventional approaches, it offers results that are accurate, quick, and time efficient. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, which are common performance indicators, were also predictive."

While histopathology images provide robust biochemical markers for tumor progression in clinical settings, a quantitative single cell score using nuclear morphology and chromatin organization integrated with the long range mechanical coupling within the tumor microenvironment is missing. We propose that the spatial chromatin organization in individual nuclei characterises the cell state and their alterations during tumor progression. In this paper, we first built an image analysis pipeline and implemented it to classify nuclei from patient derived breast tissue biopsies of various cancer stages based on their nuclear and chromatin features. Replacing H&E with DNA binding dyes such as Hoescht stained tissue biopsies, we improved the classification accuracy. Using the nuclear morphology and chromatin organization features, we constructed a pseudo-time model to identify the chromatin state changes that occur during tumour progression. This enabled us to build a single-cell mechano-genomic score that characterises the cell state during tumor progression from a normal to a metastatic state. To gain further insights into the alterations in the local tissue microenvironments, we also used the nuclear orientations to identify spatial neighbourhoods that have been posited to drive tumor progression. Collectively, we demonstrate that image-based single cell chromatin and nuclear features are important single cell biomarkers for phenotypic mapping of tumor progression."

This complication often causes significant morbidity due to systemic involvement and needs to be treated aggressively. T-regulatory cells (T-regs) are the immunomodulatory subset of T cells that are hypothesized to play a role in ENL. We have performed immunohistochemistry for FoxP3 (T-reg), CD3 (pan-T), CD4 (helper T), and CD8 (cytotoxic T) on 50 biopsy-proven cases of ENL along with 84 biopsy-proven cases of paucibacillary leprosy (PBL) (n = 49) and MBL (n = 35). Image morphometry was applied to objectively assess the relative preponderance of these subsets of T cells. The area fraction of T-regs showed a trend of reduction from PBL to MBL to ENL (P = 0.068), whereas the FoxP3:CD3 (T-reg: pan-T) ratio showed a significant reduction across these groups (P = 0.023). However, there was no significant difference of T-regs or FoxP3:CD3 ratio between MBL and ENL. The T-regs showed a significant positive correlation (P = 0.007) with the cytotoxic T cells in the skin biopsy. The presence of dermal eosinophils in ENL showed a trend association with the FoxP3:CD3 ratio (P = 0.05). Various histopathological parameters including epidermal spongiosis, dermal stromal edema, dermal ill-formed granuloma, and the presence of bacilli within the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle correlated with various T-cell subsets. Our study, one of the largest on this topic, objectively assessed the role of T-regs in the spectrum of leprosy. Nevertheless, the precipitation of ENL from MBL is probably not associated with the T-reg subset alone."

We hypothesized that HVPG could be extrapolated from liver histology using a machine learning (ML) algorithm. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Patients with NASH with compensated cirrhosis from a phase 2b trial were included. HVPG and biopsies from baseline and weeks 48 and 96 were reviewed centrally, and biopsies evaluated with a convolutional neural network (PathAI, Boston, MA). Using trichrome-stained biopsies in the training set (n = 130), an ML model was developed to recognize fibrosis patterns associated with HVPG, and the resultant ML HVPG score was validated in a held-out test set (n = 88). Associations between the ML HVPG score with measured HVPG and liver-related events, and performance of the ML HVPG score for clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) (HVPG >/= 10 mm Hg), were determined. The ML-HVPG score was more strongly correlated with HVPG than hepatic collagen by morphometry (rho = 0.47 vs. rho = 0.28; P < 0.001). The ML HVPG score differentiated patients with normal (0-5 mm Hg) and elevated (5.5-9.5 mm Hg) HVPG and CSPH (median: 1.51 vs. 1.93 vs. 2.60; all P < 0.05). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) (95% CI) of the ML-HVPG score for CSPH were 0.85 (0.80, 0.90) and 0.76 (0.68, 0.85) in the training and test sets, respectively. Discrimination of the ML-HVPG score for CSPH improved with the addition of a ML parameter for nodularity, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin (AUROC in test set: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.92). Although baseline ML-HVPG score was not prognostic, changes were predictive of clinical events (HR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.26, 3.59) and associated with hemodynamic response and fibrosis improvement. CONCLUSIONS: An ML model based on trichrome-stained liver biopsy slides can predict CSPH in patients with NASH with cirrhosis."

Recently, there are efforts to improve the prediction by various machine learning approaches. An open dataset collection including the recently digitalized single-cell images for 200 patients, from peripheral blood smears at 100 x magnification, was used. We studied different morphological, fractal, and textural descriptors for WBC classification, with an aim to indicate the most reliable parameters for the recognition of certain cell types. Structural properties of both the mature and non-mature leukocytes obtained from (i) acute myeloid leukemia patients, or (ii) non-malignant controls, were studied in depth, with a sample size of about 25 WBC per group. We quantified structural and textural differences and, based on the statistical ranges of parameters for different WBC types, selected eight features for classification: Cell area, Nucleus-to-cell ratio, Nucleus solidity, Fractal dimension, Correlation, Contrast, Homogeneity, and Energy. Classification Precision of up to 100% (80% on average) was achieved."

Therefore, complete knowledge of the structural organization of different human brain regions at the cellular level would allow understanding their role in the functions of specific neural networks. Recent advances in tissue clearing techniques have allowed important advances towards this goal. These methods use specific chemicals capable of dissolving lipids, making the tissue completely transparent by homogenizing the refractive index. However, labeling and clearing human brain samples is still challenging. Here, we present an approach to perform the cellular mapping of the human cerebral cortex coupling immunostaining with SWITCH/TDE clearing and confocal microscopy. A specific evaluation of the contributions of the autofluorescence signals generated from the tissue fixation is provided as well as an assessment of lipofuscin pigments interference. Our evaluation demonstrates the possibility of obtaining an efficient clearing and labeling process of parts of adult human brain slices, making it an excellent method for morphological classification and antibody validation of neuronal and non-neuronal markers."

We generated advanced-sectioned images of the entire male body and verified that anatomical structures of both normal and abnormal shapes could be visualized in them. The cadaver was serially sectioned at constant intervals using a cryomacrotome. The sectioned surfaces were photographed using a digital camera to generate horizontal advanced-sectioned images in which normal and abnormal structures were classified. Advanced-sectioned images of the entire male body were generated. The image resolution was 3.3 x 3.3 fold better than that of the first sectioned images obtained in 2002. In the advanced-sectioned images, normal and abnormal structures ranging from microscopic (>/=0.06 mm x 0.06 mm; pixel size) to macroscopic (</=473.1 mm x 202 mm; body size) could be identified. Furthermore, the real shapes and actual sites of lung cancer and lymph node enlargement were ascertained in them. Such images will be useful because of their true color and high resolution in digital 2D and 3D applications for gross anatomy and clinical anatomy. In future, we plan to generate new advanced-sectioned images of abnormal cadavers with different diseases for clinical anatomy studies."

However, obtaining such exhaustive manual annotations is often expensive, laborious, and prone to inter and intra-observer variability. While recent self-supervised and semi-supervised methods can alleviate this need by learning unsupervised feature representations, they still struggle to generalize well to downstream tasks when the number of labeled instances is small. In this work, we overcome this challenge by leveraging both task-agnostic and task-specific unlabeled data based on two novel strategies: (i) a self-supervised pretext task that harnesses the underlying multi-resolution contextual cues in histology whole-slide images to learn a powerful supervisory signal for unsupervised representation learning; (ii) a new teacher-student semi-supervised consistency paradigm that learns to effectively transfer the pretrained representations to downstream tasks based on prediction consistency with the task-specific unlabeled data. We carry out extensive validation experiments on three histopathology benchmark datasets across two classification and one regression based tasks, i.e., tumor metastasis detection, tissue type classification, and tumor cellularity quantification. Under limited-label data, the proposed method yields tangible improvements, which is close to or even outperforming other state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised baselines. Furthermore, we empirically show that the idea of bootstrapping the self-supervised pretrained features is an effective way to improve the task-specific semi-supervised learning on standard benchmarks.

Mitosis cells detection is a challenging task due to the heterogeneous microenvironment of breast histopathology images. Recognition of complex and inconsistent objects in the medical images could be achieved by incorporating domain knowledge in the field of interest. In this study, the strategies of the histopathologist and domain knowledge approach were used to guide the development of the image processing framework for automated mitosis cells detection in breast histopathology images. The detection framework starts with color normalization and hyperchromatic nucleus segmentation. Then, a knowledge-assisted false positive reduction method is proposed to eliminate the false positive (i.e., non-mitosis cells). This stage aims to minimize the percentage of false positive and thus increase the F1-score. Next, features extraction was performed. The mitosis candidates were classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. For evaluation purposes, the knowledge-assisted detection framework was tested using two datasets: a custom dataset and a publicly available dataset (i.e., MITOS dataset). The proposed knowledge-assisted false positive reduction method was found promising by eliminating at least 87.1% of false positive in both the dataset producing promising results in the F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-assisted detection framework can achieve promising results in F1-score (custom dataset: 89.1%; MITOS dataset: 88.9%) and outperforms the recent works."

Currently, this is done manually by observing the morphological characteristics of white blood cells in the microscopic images. Though there are some equipment- based and chemical-based tests available, the use and adaptation of the automated computer vision-based system is still an issue. There are certain software frameworks available in the literature; however, they are still not being adopted commercially. So there is a need for an automated and software- based framework for the detection of leukemia. In software-based detection, segmentation is the first critical stage that outputs the region of interest for further accurate diagnosis. Therefore, this paper explores an efficient and hybrid segmentation that proposes a more efficient and effective system for leukemia diagnosis. A very popular publicly available database, the acute lymphoblastic leukemia image database (ALL-IDB), is used in this research. First, the images are pre-processed and segmentation is done using Multilevel thresholding with Otsu and Kapur methods. To further optimize the segmentation performance, the Learning enthusiasm-based teaching-learning-based optimization (LebTLBO) algorithm is employed. Different metrics are used for measuring the system performance. A comparative analysis of the proposed methodology is done with existing benchmarks methods. The proposed approach has proven to be better than earlier techniques with measuring parameters of PSNR and Similarity index. The result shows a significant improvement in the performance measures with optimizing threshold algorithms and the LebTLBO technique."

Immunofluorescence overcomes this limitation, serving as an excellent alternative for studying immune cells in mucosal tissues. However, the use of immunofluorescent microscopy for analyzing clinical samples is hampered by a lack of high-throughput quantitative analysis techniques. In this chapter, we describe methods for sectioning, staining, and imaging whole sections of human foreskin tissue. We also describe methods to automate immune cell quantification from immunofluorescent images, including image preprocessing and methods to quantify both circular and irregularly shaped immune cells using open-source software."

A pathologist analyses immunohistochemical images to detect a colour-based stain, which is brown for positive nuclei with different intensities and blue for negative nuclei. Several issues emerge during the eyeballing tissue slide analysis, such as colour variations caused by stain inhomogeneity, non-uniform illumination, irregular cell shapes, and overlapping cell nuclei. To overcome those problems, an automated computer-aided diagnosis system is proposed to segment and quantify digestive neuroendocrine tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a novel pre-processing approach based on colour space assessment. A criterion called pertinence degree is introduced to select the appropriate colour channel, followed by contrast enhancement. Subsequently, the adaptive local threshold technique that uses the modified Laplacian filter is applied to minimize the implementation complexity, highlight edges, and emphasize intensity variation between cells across the slide. Finally, the improved watershed algorithm based on the concave vertex graph is applied for cell separation. RESULTS: The performance of the algorithms for nucleus segmentation is evaluated according to both the object-level and pixel-level criteria. Our approach increases segmentation accuracy, with the F1-score equal to 0.986. There is significant agreement between the applied approach and the expert's ground truth segmentation. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques based on recall, precision, the F1-score, and the Dice coefficient."

Epub 2021 Sep 23.,A V,Microsc Res Tech,2022,2021/09/23,,,10.1002/jemt.23940,"Malaria is a major public health concern, affecting over 3.2 billion people in 91 countries. The advent of digital microscopy and Machine learning with the aim of automating Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis extensively depends on the extracted image features. The color of the cells, plasma, and stained artifacts influence the topological, geometrical, and statistical parameters being used to extract image features. During microscopic image acquisition, custom adjustments to the condenser and color temperature controls often have an influence on the extracted statistical features. But, our human visual system sub-consciously adjusts the color and retains the originality in a different lighting environment. Despite the use of appropriate image preprocessing, findings from the literature indicate that statistical feature variations exist, allowing the risk of P. falciparum misinterpretation. In order to eliminate this pervasive variation, the current work focuses on preprocessing the extracted statistical features rather than the prepossessing of the source image. It begins with the augmentation of series images for a microscopic field by inducing illumination variations during the microscopic image acquisition stage. A set of such image series is analyzed using a Nonlinear Regression Model to generalize the relationship between microscopic images acquired with variable ambient brightness and a specific feature. The projection point of the centroid feature onto the brightness parameter is identified in the model and it is denoted as the optimum brightness factor (OBF). Using the model, the feature correction factor (CF) is calculated from the rate of change of feature values over the interval OBF, and the brightness of the test image is processed. The present work has investigated OBF for selected image textural features, namely Contrast, Homogeneity, Entropy, Energy, and Correlation individually from its co-occurrence matrices. For performance analysis, the best state-of-the-art method uses selected texture as a subset feature to evaluate the effectiveness of P. falciparum malaria classification. Then, the impact of proposed feature processing is evaluated on 274 blood smear images with and without Feature Correction (FC). As a result, the ""p"" value is less than .05, which leads to the result that it is highly significant and the classification accuracy and F-score of P. falciparum malaria are increased."

CBHIR systems provide auxiliary diagnosis information for pathologists by searching for and returning regions that are contently similar to the region of interest (ROI) from a pre-established database. It is challenging and yet significant in clinical applications to retrieve diagnostically relevant regions from a database consisting of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for regions retrieval from WSI database based on location-aware graphs and deep hash techniques. Compared to the present CBHIR framework, both structural information and global location information of ROIs in the WSI are preserved by graph convolution and self-attention operations, which makes the retrieval framework more sensitive to regions that are similar in tissue distribution. Moreover, benefited from the graph structure, the proposed framework has good scalability for both the size and shape variation of ROIs. It allows the pathologist to define query regions using free curves according to the appearance of tissue. Thirdly, the retrieval is achieved based on the hash technique, which ensures the framework is efficient and adequate for practical large-scale WSI database. The proposed method was evaluated on an in-house endometrium dataset with 2650 WSIs and the public ACDC-LungHP dataset. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a mean average precision above 0.667 on the endometrium dataset and above 0.869 on the ACDC-LungHP dataset in the task of irregular region retrieval, which are superior to the state-of-the-art methods. The average retrieval time from a database containing 1855 WSIs is 0.752 ms. The source code is available at https://github.com/zhengyushan/lagenet."

Fully automated processing of HE-stained images remains a challenging task due to the high degree of color intensity, size and shape uncertainty of the stained cells. For this problem, we propose a fully automatic pixel-wise semantic segmentation method based on pseudo-labels, which concerns to significantly reduce the manual cell sketching and labeling work before machine learning, and guarantees the accuracy of segmentation. First, we collect reliable training samples in a unsupervised manner based on K-means clustering results; second, we use full mixup strategy to enhance the training images and to obtain the U-Net model for the nuclei segmentation from the background. The experimental results based on the meningioma pathology image dataset show that the proposed method has good performance and the pathological features obtained statistically based on the segmentation results can be used to assist in the clinical grading of meningiomas. Compared with other machine learning strategies, it can provide a reliable reference for clinical research more effectively."

Therefore, evaluation of treatments and the provision of objective scar assessment pre-therapy and post-therapy is of paramount importance to identify changes in scar characteristics using noninvasive devices. Recent Advances: There have been a number of emerging noninvasive objective quantitative devices, which assess specific scar parameters such as pliability, volume, color, perfusion, and depth. These can include three-dimensional imaging, optical coherence tomography, in vivo confocal microscopy, full-field laser perfusion imaging, and spectrophotometric intracutaneous analysis. Critical Issues: Clinical assessment and grading scales are most commonly used to assess scarring; however, there is a need for more objective quantitative measures to monitor their maturation and response to therapy. Currently, there is no consensus as to which objective measuring device is most optimal when assessing skin scarring. There is a need for a predictor tool that allows early implementation of treatment and addresses diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. Future Directions: Validation of noninvasive objective scar assessment tools is essential as well as further development of technologies. There are currently more modalities that assess physical scar characteristics and only few that measure the physiological parameters. Therefore, the development of a technology that quantifies the metabolic and cellular activity in skin scars is necessary to allow for bespoke strategies for each patient."

This study aimed to evaluate the potential of LCI to increase the detection of colorectal adenomas in screening colonoscopies. METHODS: A prospective randomized study was conducted using white-light imaging (WLI), blue-laser imaging (BLI)-bright and LCI. The outcome measures were adenoma detection rate (ADR), mean number of adenomas per patient, and withdrawal time. Lesion characteristics such as size, morphology, location, and histology were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 205 patients were randomized, and 251 adenomas were detected. The overall ADR was 62%. The ADR was 52.9% for WLI, 62.1% for BLI-bright, and 71% for LCI, and was significantly higher in the LCI group than in the WLI group (P=0.04). No significant difference was observed between LCI and BLI-bright (P=0.28) or BLI-bright and WLI (P=0.30). The mean number of adenomas per patient was 1.01, 1.03, and 1.62 for WLI, BLI-bright, and LCI, respectively, with a significant difference (P=0.02). Withdrawal time did not differ among the groups.

The key to solving the LCT grading problem is to transfer knowledge from other images and to identify more accurate LROIs, but the following problems occur: 1) transferring knowledge without a priori experience often causes negative transfer and creates a heavy workload due to the abundance of image types, and 2) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) constructing deep models by stacking cannot sufficiently identify LROIs, often deviate significantly from the LROIs focused on by experienced pathologists, and are prone to providing misleading second opinions. So we propose a novel fusion attention block network (FABNet) to address these problems. First, we propose a model transfer method based on clinical a priori experience and sample analysis (CPESA) that analyzes the transfer ability by integrating clinical a priori experience using indicators such as the relationship between the cancer onset location and morphology and the texture and staining degree of cell nuclei in histopathology images; our method further validates these indicators by the probability distribution of cancer image samples. Then, we propose a fusion attention block (FAB) structure, which can both provide an advanced non-uniform sparse representation of images and extract spatial relationship information between nuclei; consequently, the LROI can be more accurate and more relevant to pathologists. We conducted extensive experiments, compared with the best Baseline model, the classification accuracy is improved 25%, and It is demonstrated that FABNet performs better on different cancer pathology image datasets and outperforms other state of the art (SOTA) models."

Here, we aim to propose a three-dimensional (3D) in situ intratumoral microbiota visualization and quantification protocol avoiding surface contamination and provide a comprehensive histological investigation on local bacteria within human glioma samples. We develop a 3D quantitative in situ intratumoral microbiota imaging strategy, combining tissue clearing, immunofluorescent labeling, optical sectioning microscopy, and image processing, to visualize bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) within gliomas in a direct, contaminant-free, and unambiguous manner. Through an automated statistical algorithm, reliable signals can be distinguished for further analysis of their sizes, distribution, and fluorescence intensities. In tandem, we also combined 2D images obtained from thin-section histological methods, including immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization, to provide comprehensive histological imaging for local bacterial components within human glioma samples. We have, for the first time, achieved 3D quantitative imaging of bacterial LPS colonized in gliomas in a contamination-free manner within human glioma samples. We also built the multiple histological evidence chain demonstrating the irregular shapes and sparse distribution of bacterial components within human glioma samples, mostly localized near nuclear membranes or in the intercellular space. This study provides favorable evidence for the presence of microbiota in human gliomas and provides information on the feature and distribution of bacterial components. The results, along with the integrated 3D quantitative intratumoral microbiota imaging method, are promising to provide insightful information into the direct interactions between the microbial community and the host in the tumor microenvironment."

Hence, when dealing with a large amount of data, the analysis becomes incredibly time-consuming and typically yields poor biological information. In this paper, we propose a fully-automated system for segmentation, tracking and feature extraction of migrating cells within blood vessels in 4D microscopy imaging. Our system consists of a robust 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint blood vessel and cell segmentation, a 3D tracking module with collision handling, and a novel method for feature extraction, which takes into account the particular geometry in the cell-vessel arrangement. Experiments on a large 4D intravital microscopy dataset show that the proposed system achieves a significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art tools for cell segmentation and tracking. Furthermore, we have designed an analytical method of cell behaviors based on the automatically extracted features, which supports the hypotheses related to leukocyte migration posed by expert biologists.

Epub 2022 Feb 26.,Olender ML,Comput Med Imaging Graph,2022,2022/03/10,,,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2022.102051,"Atherosclerosis is a complex disease altering vasculature morphology, and subsequently flow, with progressive plaque formation, mural disruption, and lumen occlusion. Determination of clinically-relevant plaque components-particularly calcium, lipid, and fibrous tissue-has driven automated image-based tissue characterization. Atherosclerotic tissue of mixed composition type arises when these principal components interdigitate and combine during the course of progressive atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, such mixed plaque is treated non-uniformly, and often neglected, as a distinct class in image analysis. We therefore quantitatively investigate frameworks to characterize mixed and other plaque tissue types, and examine their implications. Convolutional neural networks operated on labeled intravascular optical coherence tomography images using various characterization frameworks. The treatment of mixed plaque by image-based classifiers influenced the accuracy and homogeneity of the segmented classes. Excluding mixed plaque as a class on to itself necessarily assigns heterogeneous lesion subcomponents to one of the three homogeneous subtypes; when included, 61.7% of mixed tissue is labeled as calcium, reducing specificity in homogeneous calcium detection by 34.8%. Segmenting mixed plaque as distinct from homogeneous, non-mixed tissue improves lesion classification. This can be achieved either on the basis of homogeneous tissue classifier prediction uncertainty (77.8% overall accuracy) or by training classifiers to identify mixed plaque as a discrete tissue class (82.9% overall accuracy). Alternatively, mixed plaque can be grouped with one of the homogeneous classes, yielding a single histologically diverse class that helps preserve the homogeneity of the others. Ultimately, the best approach depends upon the alignment of histological and functional distinctions. While no vascular lesion characterization framework or method is universally optimal or appropriate, context should remain central in selecting tissue characterization techniques."

The recognition of histopathological images of breast cancer has attracted a lot of attention in the field of medical image processing. In this paper, on the base of the Bioimaging 2015 dataset, a two-stage nuclei segmentation strategy, that is, a method of watershed segmentation based on histopathological images after stain separation, is proposed to make the dataset recognized to be the carcinoma and non-carcinoma recognition. Firstly, stain separation is performed on breast cancer histopathological images. Then the marker-based watershed segmentation method is used for images obtained from stain separation to achieve the nuclei segmentation target. Next, the completed local binary pattern is used to extract texture features from the nuclei regions (images after nuclei segmentation), and color features were extracted by using the color auto-correlation method on the stain-separated images. Finally, the two kinds of features were fused and the support vector machine was used for carcinoma and non-carcinoma recognition. The experimental results show that the two-stage nuclei segmentation strategy proposed in this paper has significant advantages in the recognition of carcinoma and non-carcinoma on breast cancer histopathological images, and the recognition accuracy arrives at 91.67%. The proposed method is also applied to the ICIAR 2018 dataset to realize the automatic recognition of carcinoma and non-carcinoma, and the recognition accuracy arrives at 92.50%."

Contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) has been shown to outperform standard mammography while performing comparably to contrast-enhanced MRI. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to compare imaging characteristics of false-positive and true-positive findings on CEDM. METHODS. This retrospective study included women who underwent baseline screening CEDM between January 2013 and December 2018 assessed as BI-RADS category 0, 3, 4, or 5 and who underwent biopsy with histopathologic diagnosis or had a 2-year imaging follow-up. Lesion characteristics were extracted from CEDM reports. A true-positive finding was defined as a lesion in which biopsy yielded malignancy. A false-positive finding was defined as a lesion in which biopsy yielded benign or benign high-risk pathology or in which 2-year imaging follow-up was negative. RESULTS. Of 157 patients (median age, 52 years), 24 had a total of 26 true-positive lesions, and 133 had a total of 147 false-positive lesions. Of the 26 true-positive lesions, one (4%) exhibited only a mammographic finding on low-iodine images, 13 (50%) exhibited only a contrast finding on iodine images, and 12 (46%) exhibited both a mammographic finding on low-energy images and a contrast finding on iodine images. A true-positive result was more likely (p = .02) for lesions present on both low-energy images and iodine images (31%) than on low-energy images only (4%) or iodine images only (12%). Among lesions present on both low-energy and iodine images, a true-positive result was more likely (p < .001) when the type of mammographic finding was an asymmetry (46%) or calcification (80%) than a mass (11%) or distortion (0%). A true-positive result was more likely (p = .01) among those with, versus those without, an ultrasound correlate (36% vs 9%) and also was more likely (p = .02) among those with, versus those without, an MRI correlate (18% vs 2%). Of 25 false-positive calcifications, 24 had no associated mammographic enhancement; of five true-positive calcifications, four had mammographic enhancement. CONCLUSION. A low-energy mammographic finding with associated enhancement or a finding with a sonographic or MRI correlate predicts a true-positive result. Calcifications with associated enhancement had a high malignancy rate. Nonetheless, half of true-positive lesions enhanced on iodine images without a mammographic finding on low-energy images. CLINICAL IMPACT. These observations inform radiologists' management of abnormalities detected on screening CEDM."

For many of the considerable diagnostic analyses, it is common practice to assess two or more different histological slides or images from one tissue sample. A specific area analysis of two image modalities requires an overlay of the images to distinguish positions in the sample that are organized at a similar coordinate in both images. In particular cases, there are two common challenges in digital pathology: first, dissimilar appearances of images resulting due to staining variances and artifacts; second, large image size. In this paper, we develop algorithm to overcome the fact that scanners from different manufacturers have variations in the images. We propose whole slide image registration algorithm where adaptive smoothing is employed to smooth the stained image. A modified scale-invariant feature transform is applied to extract common information and a joint distance helps to match keypoints correctly by eliminating position transformation error. Finally, the registered image is obtained by utilizing correct correspondences and the interpolation of color intensities. We validate our proposal using different images acquired from surgical resection samples of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma). Extensive feature matching with apparently increasing correct correspondences and registration performance on several images demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods. Our method potentially improves the matching accuracy that might be beneficial for computer-aided diagnosis in biobank applications."

This process may remove functional tissue, may miss abnormalities through under-sampling, prevents rapid decision-making, and increases costs. Here, we report the feasibility of microscopes based on swept confocally aligned planar excitation technology for the volumetric histological imaging of intact living tissue in real time. The systems' single-objective, light-sheet geometry and 3D imaging speeds enable roving image acquisition, which combined with 3D stitching permits the contiguous analysis of large tissue areas, as well as the dynamic assessment of tissue perfusion and function. Implemented in benchtop and miniaturized form factors, the microscopes also have high sensitivity, even for weak intrinsic fluorescence, allowing for the label-free imaging of diagnostically relevant histoarchitectural structures, as we show for pancreatic disease in living mice, for chronic kidney disease in fresh human kidney tissues, and for oral mucosa in a healthy volunteer. Miniaturized high-speed light-sheet microscopes for in-situ volumetric histological imaging may facilitate the point-of-care detection of diverse cellular-level biomarkers."

A set of three synthetic patterns with strong Fedorov-type pseudosymmetries and varying amounts of noise serve as examples. Contrary to traditional crystallographic symmetry classifications with an image processing program such as CRISP, the classification process does not need to be supervised by a human being and is free of any subjectively set thresholds in the geometric model selection process. This enables crystallographic symmetry classification of digital images that are more or less periodic in two dimensions (2D), also known as crystal patterns, as recorded with sufficient structural resolution from a wide range of crystalline samples with different types of scanning probe and transmission electron microscopes. Correct symmetry classifications enable the optimal crystallographic processing of such images. That processing consists of the averaging over all asymmetric units in all unit cells in the selected image area and significantly enhances both the signal-to-noise ratio and the structural resolution of a microscopic study of a crystal. For sufficiently complex crystal patterns, the information-theoretic symmetry classification methods are more accurate than both visual classifications by human experts and the recommendations of one of the popular crystallographic image processing programs of electron crystallography."

Oral cancer is the most usual cancer in the world, with more than 300,335 deaths every year. The cancerous tumor appears in the neck, oral glands, face, and mouth. To overcome this dangerous cancer, there are many ways to detect like a biopsy, in which small chunks of tissues are taken from the mouth and tested under a secure and hygienic microscope. However, microscope results of tissues to detect oral cancer are not up to the mark, a microscope cannot easily identify the cancerous cells and normal cells. Detection of cancerous cells using microscopic biopsy images helps in allaying and predicting the issues and gives better results if biologically approaches apply accurately for the prediction of cancerous cells, but during the physical examinations microscopic biopsy images for cancer detection there are major chances for human error and mistake. So, with the development of technology deep learning algorithms plays a major role in medical image diagnosing.

For image synthesis, we used embedding features extracted from a segmentation module in a general generative model. We also introduce a simple solution for training a segmentation model in an environment in which the masked label of the training dataset is not supplied. As a result of this experiment, the proposed method did not make great progress in quantitative metrics but showed improved results in the confusion rate of more than 70 subjects and the quality of the visual output."

This paper aims to design and implement a fast and reliable system based on microscopic image processing of patient tissue samples for the automatic diagnosis of anthrax and other tissues diseases, metastasis detection, patient prognosis, etc. An improved UNet++ architecture is proposed to segment microscopic images of patient tissue samples. The proposed model combines multi-scale features by adding skip connections in two paths; the forward path from the encoder to the decoder and the decoder path to the output. These new connections improve the performance of the UNet++. Integration of the squeeze and excitation-inception blocks in the new skip connections provides the network with features at different scales with different kernel sizes. Several convolutional networks are used as the backbone to extract powerful representations in the encoder section. The use of batch normalization, dropout technique, and LRelu activation function in this model accelerates convergence and increases the generalization power of the model. To overcome the problem of data imbalance of different classes, a weighted hybrid loss function is proposed, which further improved segmentation efficiency. The semantic segmentation results are converted to the instance segmentation using the marker-based watershed algorithm. Experimental results show that despite many challenges of microscopic image analysis, the proposed model is a reliable system for the automatic diagnosis of anthrax and other tissues diseases. It produces better results than state-of-the-art architectures."

Most methods rely on tissue staining and microscopy in two-dimensions, which pose several challenges to visualize the three-dimensional structure of microvessels. In this study, we used an edge-based segmentation method to extract the 3D vasculature from synchrotron radiation phase-contrast microtomography (PC-muCT) of two unstained, paraffin-embedded midbrain region of the human brain stem. Vascular structures identified in PC-muCT were validated with histology of the same specimen. Using the Deriche-Canny edge detector that was sensitive to the boundary between tissue and vascular space, we could segment the vessels independent of signal variations in PC-muCT images. From the segmented volumetric vasculature, we calculated vessel diameter, vessel length and volume fraction of the vasculature in the superior colliculi. From high resolution images, we found the most frequent vessel diameter to be between 8.6-10.2 microm. Our findings are consistent with the known anatomy showing two types of vessels with distinctive morphology: peripheral collicular vessels and central collicular vessels. The proposed method opens up new possibilities for vascular research of the central nervous system using synchrotron radiation PC-muCT of unstained human tissue."

The results showed that the sensitivity of line-focused ultrasound detector was 86.72% and the specificity was 80.79%, while the sensitivity of the flat-field ultrasound detector was 63.15% and the specificity was 71.79%. The photoacoustic microscopy imaging technology can clearly observe the rich capillary network on human lips. A part of the vascular network at the depth of 100 mum, 500 mum, and 1000 mum grew out of the reticular capillaries and extended out of the loop-like capillaries, and the diameter gradually expanded. The imaging experiment of the sublingual capillary network in the human body showed that loop-like capillaries were observed, but there were some large blood vessels, which corresponded to the densely distributed blood vessel network under the tongue. The morphological changes of loop-like capillaries can be well observed by photoacoustic microscopy. In conclusion, the reconstructed photoacoustic microscopy imaging technology can realize high-resolution imaging of human oral capillaries and observe the morphological changes of loop-like capillaries, which had a certain application value for the early detection of oral cancer."

This paper is evaluating and comparing the efficiency and performance of feature extraction techniques (colour descriptors and Haralick texture descriptors) and a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) built and trained by using the TensorFlow packages for classifying leukaemia images. Extracting texture and colour features from a given set of leukaemia images through computation was successful in detecting the type of disease and the results analysed with Weka Classifiers were giving the highest accuracy of 93.58%. TensorFlow tested with Cross-Validation proves efficient in training and customising the system, but the accuracy was median 56% and was not greatly improved by addressing the class imbalance issue from the data set with SMOTE.

However, they ignore the complementarity between Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Immunohistochemically (IHC) stained images, which can provide comprehensive gold standard for cancer diagnosis. To resolve this issue, we propose a cross-boosted multi-target domain adaptation pipeline for multi-modality histopathology images, which contains Cross-frequency Style-auxiliary Translation Network (CSTN) and Dual Cross-boosted Segmentation Network (DCSN). Firstly, CSTN achieves the one-to-many translation from fluorescence microscopy images to H&E and IHC images for providing source domain training data. To generate images with realistic color and texture, Cross-frequency Feature Transfer Module (CFTM) is developed to pertinently restructure and normalize high-frequency content and low-frequency style features from different domains. Then, DCSN fulfills multi-target domain adaptive segmentation, where a dual-branch encoder is introduced, and Bidirectional Cross-domain Boosting Module (BCBM) is designed to implement cross-modality information complementation through bidirectional inter-domain collaboration. Finally, we establish Multi-modality Thymus Histopathology (MThH) dataset, which is the largest publicly available H&E and IHC image benchmark. Experiments on MThH dataset and several public datasets show that the proposed pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both histopathology image translation and segmentation."

However, the structural randomness and complexity have hindered rigorous mathematical modeling of trabecular bone microarchitecture. Recent advancements in imaging processing techniques have enabled us to define the size, orientation, and spatial location of individual trabecular plates and rods in trabecular bone. Based on the essential information, this study proposed a probability-based approach to define the size, orientation, and spatial distributions of trabecular plates and rods for trabecular bone cubes (N = 547) acquired from six human cadaver proximal femurs. Using two groups of probability-based parameters, it was attempted to capture microarchitectural details, which could not be captured by the existing histomorphometric parameters, but crucial to the elastic properties of trabecular bone. The elastic properties of the trabecular bone cubes in three principal axes were estimated using microCT based finite element (FE) simulations. Based on the results of multivariate multiple regression modeling, the efficacy of the two groups of probability-based parameters in prediction of the elastic properties was verified in comparison with that of the existing histomorphometric parameters (BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, DA, EF.Med, and Conn.D). The results indicated that the regression models trained using the probability-based parameters had a comparable and even better accuracy (rMSE = 0.621 and 0.548) than that of the histomorphometric parameters (rMSE = 0.647). More importantly, the probability-based parameters could provide more insights into some unexplored microarchitectural features, such as individual trabecular size, orientation, and spatial distributions, which are also critical to the elastic properties of trabecular bone."

CNF is usually visualized under corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) in clinic. To obtain the diagnostic biomarkers from CNF image produced from CCM, image processing and quantitative analysis are needed. Usually, CNF is segmented first and then CNF's centerline is extracted, allowing for measuring geometrical and topological biomarkers of CNF, such as density, tortuosity, and length. Consequently, the accuracy of the segmentation and centerline extraction can make a big impact on the biomarker measurement. Thus, this study is aimed to improve the accuracy and universality of centerline extraction.Approach.We developed a new thinning algorithm based on neighborhood statistics, called neighborhood-statistics thinning (NST), to extract the centerline of CNF. Compared with traditional thinning and skeletonization techniques, NST exhibits a better capability to preserve the fine structure of CNF which can effectively benefit the biomarkers measurement above. Moreover, NST incorporates a fitting process, which can make centerline extraction be less influenced by image segmentation.Main results.This new method is evaluated on three datasets which are segmented with five different deep learning networks. The results show that NST is superior to thinning and skeletonization on all the CNF-segmented datasets with a precision rate above 0.82. Last, NST is attempted to be applied for the diagnosis of keratitis with the quantitative biomarkers measured from the extracted centerlines. Longer length and higher density but lower tortuosity were found on the CNF of keratitis patients as compared to healthy patients.Significance.This demonstrates that NST has a good potential to aid in the diagnostics of eye diseases in clinic."

Unfortunately, numerous cellular structures present unique challenges in their ability to be unbiasedly and accurately detected and quantified. In our studies on stress granules in yeast, users displayed a striking variation of up to 3.7-fold in foci calls and were only able to replicate their results with 62-78% accuracy, when re-quantifying the same images. To facilitate consistent results we developed HARLEY (Human Augmented Recognition of LLPS Ensembles in Yeast), a customizable software for detection and quantification of stress granules in S. cerevisiae. After a brief model training on ~ 20 cells the detection and quantification of foci is fully automated and based on closed loops in intensity contours, constrained only by the a priori known size of the features of interest. Since no shape is implied, this method is not limited to round features, as is often the case with other algorithms. Candidate features are annotated with a set of geometrical and intensity-based properties to train a kernel Support Vector Machine to recognize features of interest. The trained classifier is then used to create consistent results across datasets. For less ambiguous foci datasets, a parametric selection is available. HARLEY is an intuitive tool aimed at yeast microscopy users without much technical expertise. It allows batch processing of foci detection and quantification, and the ability to run various geometry-based and pixel-based colocalization analyses to uncover trends or correlations in foci-related data.

CycleGAN is used for color normalization in pathological pictures to tackle the problem of uneven staining. However, the resultant detection model is ineffective. By overlapping the images, the DPN uses the addition of small convolution, deconvolution, and attention mechanisms to enhance the model's ability to classify the texture features of pathological images on the BreaKHis dataset. The parameters that are taken into consideration for measuring the accuracy of the proposed model are false-positive rate, false-negative rate, recall, precision, and F1 score. Several experiments are carried out over the selected parameters, such as making comparisons between benign and malignant classification accuracy under different normalization methods, comparison of accuracy of image level and patient level using different CNN models, correlating the correctness of DPN68-A network with different deep learning models and other classification algorithms at all magnifications. The results thus obtained have proved that the proposed model DPN68-A network can effectively classify the benign and malignant breast cancer pathological images at various magnifications. The proposed model also is able to better assist the pathologists in diagnosing the patients by synthesizing the images of different magnifications in the clinical stage."

This evaluation aims to determine the grade of cellular differentiation and the aggressiveness of the tumor by the Nottingham Grade Classification System (NGS). Nowadays, digital pathology is an innovative tool for pathologists in diagnosis and acquiring new learning. However, a recurring problem in health services is the excessive workload in all medical services. For this reason, it is required to develop computational tools that assist histological evaluation. This work proposes a methodology for the quantitative analysis of BC tissue that follows NGS. The proposed methodology is based on digital image processing techniques through which the BC tissue can be characterized automatically. Moreover, the proposed nuclei characterization was helpful for grade differentiation in carcinoma images of the BC tissue reaching an 0.84 accuracy. In addition, a metric was proposed to assess the likelihood of a structure in the tissue corresponding to a tubule by considering spatial and geometrical characteristics between lumina and its surrounding nuclei, reaching an accuracy of 0.83. Tests were performed from different databases and under various magnification and staining contrast conditions, showing that the methodology is reliable for histological breast tissue analysis."

In this regard, recent advance in machine learning-based image analysis is promising. METHODS: We combined Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN) with an additional classification step to build a glomerulus detection model using human kidney biopsy samples. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network was applied for glomerular disease classification, and another two-stage model using ResNeXt-101 was constructed for glomerular lesion identification in cases of lupus nephritis. RESULTS: The detection model showed state-of-the-art performance on variedly stained slides with F1 scores up to 0.944. The disease classification model showed good accuracies up to 0.940 on recognizing different glomerular diseases based on H&E whole slide images. The lesion identification model demonstrated high discriminating power with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve up to 0.947 for various glomerular lesions. Models showed good generalization on external testing datasets. CONCLUSION: This study is the first-of-its-kind showing how each step of kidney biopsy interpretation carried out by nephropathologists can be captured and simulated by machine learning models. The models were integrated into a whole slide image viewing and annotating platform to enable nephropathologists to review, correct, and confirm the inference results. Further improvement on model performances and incorporating inputs from immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and clinical data might realize actual clinical use."

Epub 2022 Aug 11.,Gupta A,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,2022,2022/05/24,,,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3177602,"OBJECTIVE: Large-scale microscopy-based experiments often result in images with rich but sparse information content. An experienced microscopist can visually identify regions of interest (ROIs), but this becomes a cumbersome task with large datasets. Here we present SimSearch, a framework for quick and easy user-guided training of a deep neural model aimed at fast detection of ROIs in large-scale microscopy experiments. METHODS: The user manually selects a small number of patches representing different classes of ROIs. This is followed by feature extraction using a pre-trained deep-learning model, and interactive patch selection pruning, resulting in a smaller set of clean (user approved) and larger set of noisy (unapproved) training patches of ROIs and background. The pre-trained deep-learning model is thereafter first trained on the large set of noisy patches, followed by refined training using the clean patches. RESULTS: The framework is evaluated on fluorescence microscopy images from a large-scale drug screening experiment, brightfield images of immunohistochemistry-stained patient tissue samples, and malaria-infected human blood smears, as well as transmission electron microscopy images of cell sections. Compared to state-of-the-art and manual/visual assessment, the results show similar performance with maximal flexibility and minimal a priori information and user interaction. CONCLUSIONS: SimSearch quickly adapts to different data sets, which demonstrates the potential to speed up many microscopy-based experiments based on a small amount of user interaction. SIGNIFICANCE: SimSearch can help biologists quickly extract informative regions and perform analyses on large datasets helping increase the throughput in a microscopy experiment."

An automatic nuclei segmentation approach can reduce pathologists' workload and allow precise of the microenvironment for biological and clinical researches. Existing deep learning models have achieved outstanding performance under the supervision of a large amount of labeled data. However, when data from the unseen domain comes, we still have to prepare a certain degree of manual annotations for training for each domain. Unfortunately, obtaining histopathological annotations is extremely difficult. It is high expertise-dependent and time-consuming. In this paper, we attempt to build a generalized nuclei segmentation model with less data dependency and more generalizability. To this end, we propose a meta multi-task learning (Meta-MTL) model for nuclei segmentation which requires fewer training samples. A model-agnostic meta-learning is applied as the outer optimization algorithm for the segmentation model. We introduce a contour-aware multi-task learning model as the inner model. A feature fusion and interaction block (FFIB) is proposed to allow feature communication across both tasks. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed Meta-MTL model can improve the model generalization and obtain a comparable performance with state-of-the-art models with fewer training samples. Our model can also perform fast adaptation on the unseen domain with only a few manual annotations. Code is available at https://github.com/ChuHan89/Meta-MTL4NucleiSegmentation."

Yet, previously developed approaches for automated epithelium segmentation in OC-SCC have not been independently tested in a multi-center setting. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to perform epithelial segmentation using digitized H&E-stained diagnostic slides from OC-SCC patients in a multi-center setting. METHODS: A CNN model was developed to segment the epithelial regions of digitized slides (n = 810), retrospectively collected from five different centers. Deep learning models were trained and validated using well-annotated tissue microarray (TMA) images (n = 212) at various magnifications. The best performing model was locked down and used for independent testing with a total of 478 whole-slide images (WSIs). Manually annotated epithelial regions were used as the reference standard for evaluation. We also compared the model generated results with IHC-stained epithelium (n = 120) as the reference. RESULTS: The locked-down CNN model trained on the TMA image training cohorts with 10x magnification achieved the best segmentation performance. The locked-down model performed consistently and yielded Pixel Accuracy, Recall Rate, Precision Rate, and Dice Coefficient that ranged from 95.8% to 96.6%, 79.1% to 93.8%, 85.7% to 89.3%, and 82.3% to 89.0%, respectively for the three independent testing WSI cohorts. CONCLUSION: The automated model achieved a consistently accurate performance for automated epithelial region segmentation compared to manual annotations. This model could be integrated into a computer-aided diagnosis or prognosis system."

Several manual approaches or computational methodologies are useful to provide reliable clinical diagnosis. The sample processing and data analysis is relevant, however the sample handling on the pre-analytical phase remains scarcely evaluated. The main goal of this study was to favor the preservation of blood smear using a histological resin. This strategy lead us two practical approaches, give a detailed morphometric description of white blood cells and establish reference intervals in male Wistar rats, which are scarcely reported. Blood smears from male Wistar rats (n = 120) and adult men were collected at room temperature. The integrity of Wright-stained cells was evaluated by an in silico image analysis from rat and human blood smear preserved with a toluene-based synthetic resin mounting medium. A single sample of human blood was used as a control of procedure. The reference intervals was established by cell counting. Based on the results of segmentation algorithm followed by an automatic thresholding analysis, the incorporation of resin favor the conservation of cell blood populations, and lead to identify morphologic features such as nucleus/cytoplasmic shape, granules presence and DNA appearance in nucleus of white blood cells. The use of a histological resin could favor a fast and efficient sample handling in silico MPBC measurements both in the species studied as in wild animals."

Creating accurate pixel-wise annotations for such segmentation tasks in a fully-supervised training framework requires significant effort. To reduce the burden of manual annotation, we propose a novel weakly supervised segmentation framework based on sparse patch annotation, i.e., only small portions of patches in an image are labeled as 'tumor' or 'normal'. The framework consists of a patch-wise segmentation model called PSeger, and an innovative semi-supervised algorithm. PSeger has two branches for patch classification and image classification, respectively. This two-branch structure enables the model to learn more general features and thus reduce the risk of overfitting when learning sparsely annotated data. We incorporate the idea of consistency learning and self-training into the semi-supervised training strategy to take advantage of the unlabeled images. Trained on the BCSS dataset with only 25% of the images labeled (five patches for each labeled image), our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to the fully supervised pixel-wise segmentation models. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution has the potential to reduce the burden of labeling histopathological images."

Image search in large archives of digital pathology slides provides researchers and medical professionals with an opportunity to match records of current and past patients and learn from evidently diagnosed and treated cases. When working with microscopes, pathologists switch between different magnification levels while examining tissue specimens to find and evaluate various morphological features. Inspired by the conventional pathology workflow, we have investigated several magnification levels in digital pathology and their combinations to minimize the gap between AI-enabled image search methods and clinical settings. The proposed searching framework does not rely on any regional annotation and potentially applies to millions of unlabelled (raw) whole slide images. This paper suggests two approaches for combining magnification levels and compares their performance. The first approach obtains a single-vector deep feature representation for a digital slide, whereas the second approach works with a multi-vector deep feature representation. We report the search results of 20x, 10x, and 5x magnifications and their combinations on a subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository. The experiments verify that cell-level information at the highest magnification is essential for searching for diagnostic purposes. In contrast, low-magnification information may improve this assessment depending on the tumor type. Our multi-magnification approach achieved up to 11% F1-score improvement in searching among the urinary tract and brain tumor subtypes compared to the single-magnification image search."

Two models are tested on the BreaKHis dataset show that images under four magnifications achieved the recognition accuracy of 96.89%-99.67% at the image level, which is better than many state-of-the-art methods. The characteristics contained by the B channel have the largest effect on BC recognition, and compared to other research results, the proposed model improves the recognition speed on a single image by about 0.1s. More importantly, instead of using large histopathological images to input into the model for BC diagnosis, and instead of segmenting the nuclei, only the reconstructed B-channel features containing the nuclei region in the stained BC image need to be input into the model to enable accurate diagnosis of BC."

The fibrosis stage is best assessed by histopathologic evaluation, and Masson's Trichrome stain (MT) is the stain of choice for this task in many laboratories around the world. However, the most used stain in histopathology is Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) which is cheaper, has a faster turn-around time and is the primary stain routinely used for evaluation of liver specimens. In this paper, we propose a novel digital pathology system that accurately detects and quantifies the footprint of fibrous tissue in HE whole slide images (WSI). The proposed system produces virtual MT images from HE using a deep learning model that learns deep texture patterns associated with collagen fibers. The training pipeline is based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN), which can achieve accurate pixel-level transformation. Our comprehensive training pipeline features an automatic WSI registration algorithm, which qualifies the HE/MT training slides for the cGAN model. Using liver specimens collected during liver transplantation procedures, we conducted a range of experiments to evaluate the detected footprint of selected anatomical features. Our evaluation includes both image similarity and semantic segmentation metrics. The proposed system achieved enhanced results in the experiments with significant improvement over the state-of-the-art CycleGAN learning style, and over direct prediction of fibrosis in HE without having the virtual MT step."

It intends to offer clinical gland morphometric information and cancer grade classification to be provided as referential opinions for pathologists in order to abate human errors. It embraces enhanced feature learning capability that aids in extraction of potent multi-scale features; efficacious semantic gap recovery during feature concatenation; and successful interception of resolution-degradation and vanishing gradient problems while performing moderate computations. It is proposed by integrating three unique novel structural components namely Hybrid Convolutional Learning Units in the encoder and decoder, Attention Learning Units in skip connection, and Multi-Scalar Dilated Transitional Unit as the transitional layer in the traditional U-Net architecture. These units are composed of the amalgamated phenomenon of multi-level convolutional learning through conventional, atrous, residual, depth-wise, and point-wise convolutions which are further incorporated with target-specific attention learning and enlarged effectual receptive field size. Also, pre-processing techniques of patch-sampling, augmentation (color and morphological), stain-normalization, etc. are employed to burgeon its generalizability. To build network invariance towards digital variability, exhaustive experiments are conducted using three public datasets (Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Gland (CRAG), Gland Segmentation (GlaS) challenge, and Lung Colon-25000 (LC-25K) dataset)) and then its robustness is verified using an in-house private dataset of Hospital Colon (HosC). For the cancer classification, the proposed model achieved results of Accuracy (CRAG(95%), GlaS(97.5%), LC-25K(99.97%), HosC(99.45%)), Precision (CRAG(0.9678), GlaS(0.9768), LC-25K(1), HosC(1)), F1-score (CRAG(0.968), GlaS(0.977), LC 25K(0.9997), HosC(0.9965)), and Recall (CRAG(0.9677), GlaS(0.9767), LC-25K(0.9994), HosC(0.9931)).

In addition, the activation mappings for testing the interpretability of the classification decision-making process are reported by utilizing techniques of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, Occlusion Sensitivity, and Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mappings. This is done to provide further evidence about the model's self-learning capability of the comparable patterns considered relevant by pathologists without any pre-requisite for annotations. These activation mapping visualization outcomes are evaluated by proficient pathologists, and they delivered these images with a class-path validation score of (CRAG(9.31), GlaS(9.25), LC-25K(9.05), and HosC(9.85)). Furthermore, the seg-path validation score of (GlaS (Test A(9.40), Test B(9.25)), CRAG(9.27), LC-25K(9.01), HosC(9.19)) given by multiple pathologists is included for the final segmented outcomes to substantiate the clinical relevance and suitability for facilitation at the clinical level.

Here, we present an easy-implemented data analysis method to quantitatively characterize the fluorescent signal, without considering the intensity-value. We use F-actin patches in single-melanoma cells as an example and define two quantities of elongation and surface density for F-actin patches at the contact-area of a melanoma cell. The elongation parameter can evaluate the dispersion of F-actin patches at the contact-area of a cell and is useful to classify the attaching, spreading, and expanding stages of a cell. Following that, we present the profile of the surface density of F-actin patches as a quantity to probe the spatio-temporal distribution of the F-actin patches at the contact-area of a cell. The data analysis methods that are proposed here will also be applicable in the image analysis of the other advanced optical microscopic methods."

Automated image-processing systems (AIS) provide more accurate and objective morphological evaluation. The aims of this multicenter study were the evaluation of the intra and inter-laboratory variation between different AIS in cell pre-classification and after reclassification, compared with manual optical microscopy, the reference method. METHODS: Six peripheral blood samples were included in this study, for each sample, 70 May-Grunwald and Giemsa stained PB smears were prepared from each specimen and 10 slides were delivered to the seven laboratories involved. Smears were processed by both optical microscopy (OM) and AIS. In addition, the assessment times of both methods were recorded. RESULTS: Within-laboratory Reproducibility ranged between 4.76% and 153.78%; between-laboratory Precision ranged between 2.10% and 82.2%, while Total Imprecision ranged between 5.21% and 20.60%. The relative Bland Altman bias ranged between -0.01% and 20.60%. The mean of assessment times were 326 +/- 110 s and 191 +/- 68 s for AIS post reclassification and OM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AIS can be helpful when the number of cell counted are low and can give advantages in terms of efficiency, objectivity and time saving in the morphological analysis of blood cells. They can also help in the interpretation of some morphological features and can serve as learning and investigation tools."

To enhance the generalization ability of the segmentation network, that is, to avoid the segmentation network from learning low-level features, we proposed the Complementary Color Conversion Scheme in the training phase. In addition, due to the disparity between the area of the nucleus and the background in the pathology image, there is an inherent data imbalance phenomenon, dice loss and focal loss were used to overcome this problem. In order to further strengthen the classification performance of the model, this study adopted a joint training scheme, so that the output of the classification network can not only be used to optimize the classification network itself, but also optimize the segmentation network. In addition, this model can also provide the pathologist model's attention area, increasing the model's interpretability. The classification performance verification of the proposed method was carried out with the BreaKHis dataset. Our method obtains binary/multi-class classification accuracy 97.24/93.75 and 98.19/94.43 for 200x and 400x images, outperforming existing methods."

Epub 2022 Dec 5.,He Q,Comput Biol Med,2023,2022/12/14,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.106412,"MOTIVATION: With the sites of antigen expression different, the segmentation of immunohistochemical (IHC) histopathology images is challenging, due to the visual variances. With H&E images highlighting the tissue structure and cell distribution more broadly, transferring more salient features from H&E images can achieve considerable performance on expression site agnostic IHC images segmentation. METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on domain adaptive segmentation for different expression sites. We propose an expression site agnostic domain adaptive histopathology image semantic segmentation framework (ESASeg). In ESASeg, multi-level feature alignment encodes expression site invariance by learning generic representations of global and multi-scale local features. Moreover, self-supervision enhances domain adaptation to perceive high-level semantics by predicting pseudo-labels. RESULTS: We construct a dataset with three IHCs (Her2 with membrane stained, Ki67 with nucleus stained, GPC3 with cytoplasm stained) with different expression sites from two diseases (breast and liver cancer). Intensive experiments on tumor region segmentation illustrate that ESASeg performs best across all metrics, and the implementation of each module proves to achieve impressive improvements. CONCLUSION: The performance of ESASeg on the tumor region segmentation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed framework, which provides a novel solution on expression site agnostic IHC related tasks. Moreover, the proposed domain adaption and self-supervision module can improve feature domain adaption and extraction without labels. In addition, ESASeg lays the foundation to perform joint analysis and information interaction for IHCs with different expression sites."

METHODS: Clonogenic assays of 2 head and neck cancer cell lines were counted through 4 different counting modalities: Manual counting pen, via microscope, 1 publicly available automated algorithm, and a semiautomated algorithm presented by the authors. Each method counted individual wells (N = 24). Pen and microscopic counts were performed by 2 observers. Parameters included both low-growth (<150 colonies/well) and high-growth (>150 colonies/well) cell lines. Correlational and Bland-Altman analyses were performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Interobserver manual pen count correlation R(2) value in both growth conditions was 0.902; controlling for only low-growth conditions decreased R(2) to 0.660. Correlation of microscopic versus pen counts R(2) values for observers 1 and 2 were 0.955 and 0.775, respectively. Comparing techniques, Bland-Altman revealed potential bias with respect to the magnitude of measurement (P < .001) for both observers. Correlation of microscopic counts for both interobserver (R(2 )= 0.902) and intraobserver (R(2 )= 0.916) were analyzed. Bland-Altman revealed no bias (P = .489). Automated versus microscopic counts revealed no bias between methodologies (P = .787) and a lower correlation coefficient (R(2 )= 0.384). Semiautomated versus microscopic counts revealed no bias with respect to magnitude of measurement for either observer (P = .327, .229); Pearson correlation was 0.985 (R(2 )= 0.970) and 0.965 (R(2 )= 0.931) for observer 1 and 2. Semiautomated versus manual pen colony counts revealed a significant bias with respect to magnitude of measurement (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Counting with a manual pen demonstrated significant bias when compared to microscopic and semiautomated colony counts; 2 methods were deemed to be interchangeable. Thus, training algorithms based on manual counts may introduce this bias as well. Algorithms trained to select colonies based on size (pixels(2)) and shape (circularity) should be prioritized. Solely relying on Bland-Altman or correlational analyses when determining method interchangeability should be avoided; they rather should be used in conjunction."

This problem is notoriously difficult because of the degree of presence of stains among the multi-nucleated cells, the poor contrast of cell cytoplasm, and the presence of mucus, blood, and inflammatory cells in the images. Hepatocellular carcinoma, characterized by cellular and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism, and multi-nucleation, poses a prominent threat. Our proposed method addresses the aforementioned issues for an automated diagnosis system by judging the presence of multiple nuclei in a two-step process: the Quickhull algorithm defines the convex hull of each cell in the image and candidate nuclei regions are located with morphological operations. A combination of features containing local minima and shape-dependent features is extracted for the detection of single or multiple nuclei in each cell with a significant reduction in the number of false positives and false negatives providing an accuracy of 89.76%."

METHODS: Fifty-five pregnant women (normal group, n = 27; PE group, n = 28) underwent VI, FI, and VFI at four locations in the placenta during the second and third trimesters. Two hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained specimens of the postpartum placenta were prepared. We randomly selected two of these locations and used ImageJ, an open-source image package, to quantify intervillous blood vessels (IBV), intervillous spaces (IS), and intervillous blood vessels + intervillous spaces (IBV + IS) per unit placenta and analyzed their correlation with VI, FI, and VFI. RESULTS: There was no positive correlation between VI, FI, VFI, IBV, IS, and IBV + IS. There were no significant differences in VI, FI, and VFI between the normal and PE groups; however, there were significant differences in IBV, IS, and IBV + IS in the PE group compared to those in the normal group. CONCLUSIONS: Placental hemodynamics measured by VI, FI, and VFI were not positively correlated with placental morphology in the third trimester. There were no differences in the VI, FI, and VFI in the third trimester between the normal and PE groups, suggesting that these may reflect placental circulatory insufficiency."

Histopathology image segmentation can assist medical professionals in identifying and diagnosing diseased tissue more efficiently. Although fully supervised segmentation models have excellent performance, the annotation cost is extremely expensive. Weakly supervised models are widely used in medical image segmentation due to their low annotation cost. Nevertheless, these weakly supervised models have difficulty in accurately locating the boundaries between different classes of regions in pathological images, resulting in a high rate of false alarms Our objective is to design a weakly supervised segmentation model to resolve the above problems.Approach. The segmentation model is divided into two main stages, the generation of pseudo labels based on class residual attention accumulation network (CRAANet) and the semantic segmentation based on pixel feature space construction network (PFSCNet). CRAANet provides attention scores for each class through the class residual attention module, while the Attention Accumulation (AA) module overlays the attention feature maps generated in each training epoch. PFSCNet employs a network model containing an inflated convolutional residual neural network and a multi-scale feature-aware module as the segmentation backbone, and proposes dense energy loss and pixel clustering modules are based on contrast learning to solve the pseudo-labeling-inaccuracy problem.Main results. We validate our method using the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD-HistoSeg) dataset and the breast cancer (BCSS) dataset. The results of the experiments show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both datasets in several metrics. This suggests that it is capable of performing well in a wide variety of histopathological image segmentation tasks.Significance. We propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation network that achieves approximate fully supervised segmentation performance even in the case of incomplete labels. The proposed AA and pixel-level contrast learning also make the edges more accurate and can well assist pathologists in their research."

Although currently the golden standard for structural analysis is provided by combining histological sections, staining, and visible 2D microscopic inspection, synchrotron radiation phase-contrast microtomography is becoming a new challenge for three-dimensional studies at micrometric resolution. To this aim, the proper use of contrast agents can improve the visualization of internal structures in ovary tissues, which normally present a low radiopacity. In this study, we report a comparison of four staining protocols, based on iodine or tungsten containing agents, applied to bovine ovarian tissues fixed in Bouin's solution. The microtomography (microCT) analyses at two synchrotron facilities under different set-ups were performed at different energies in order to maximize the image contrast. While tungsten-based agents allow large structures to be well identified, Iodine ones better highlight smaller features, especially when acquired above the K-edge energy of the specific metal. Further scans performed at lower energy where the setup was optimized for overall quality and sensitivity from phase-contrast still provided highly resolved visualization of follicular and intrafollicular structures at different maturation stages, independent of the staining protocol. The analyses were complemented by X-ray Fluorescence mapping on 2D sections, showing that the tungsten-based agent has a higher penetration in this type of tissues."

When applied to vitrified samples, serial FIB/SEM is also a means to target specific structures in cells and tissues while maintaining constituents' hydration shells for in situ structural biology downstream. However, the application of serial FIB/SEM imaging of non-stained cryogenic biological samples is limited due to low contrast, curtaining, and charging artefacts. We address these challenges using a cryogenic plasma FIB/SEM. We evaluated the choice of plasma ion source and imaging regimes to produce high-quality SEM images of a range of different biological samples. Using an automated workflow we produced three-dimensional volumes of bacteria, human cells, and tissue, and calculated estimates for their resolution, typically achieving 20-50 nm. Additionally, a tag-free localisation tool for regions of interest is needed to drive the application of in situ structural biology towards tissue. The combination of serial FIB/SEM with plasma-based ion sources promises a framework for targeting specific features in bulk-frozen samples (>100 microm) to produce lamellae for cryogenic electron tomography."

However, these models are not practically appropriate due to their computational complexity and too many parameters; as a result, they are rarely utilized on devices with limited computational resources. This paper develops a lightweight learning model based on knowledge distillation to classify the histopathological images of breast cancer in BreakHis. This method employs two teacher models based on VGG and ResNext to train two student models, which are similar to the teacher models in development but have fewer deep layers. In the proposed method, the adaptive joint learning approach is adopted to transfer the knowledge in the final-layer output of a teacher model along with the feature maps of its middle layers as the dark knowledge to a student model. According to the experimental results, the student model designed by ResNeXt architecture obtained the recognition rate 97.09% for all histopathological images. In addition, this model has  approximately 69.40 million fewer parameters,  approximately 0.93 G less GPU memory use, and 268.17 times greater compression rate than its teacher model. While in the student model the recognition rate merely dropped down to 1.75%. The comparisons indicated that the student model had a rather acceptable outputs compared with state-of-the-art methods in classifying the images of breast cancer in BreakHis."

The bottleneck in developing effective ML systems is often the need to acquire large datasets to train the neural network. We demonstrate how adding a ""dense encoder-decoder"" (DenseED) block can be used to effectively train a neural network that produces super-resolution (SR) images from conventional microscopy diffraction-limited (DL) images trained using a small dataset [15 fields of view (FOVs)]. AIM: The ML helps to retrieve SR information from a DL image when trained with a massive training dataset. The aim of this work is to demonstrate a neural network that estimates SR images from DL images using modifications that enable training with a small dataset. APPROACH: We employ ""DenseED"" blocks in existing SR ML network architectures. DenseED blocks use a dense layer that concatenates features from the previous convolutional layer to the next convolutional layer. DenseED blocks in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) estimate the SR images when trained with a small training dataset (15 FOVs) of human cells from the Widefield2SIM dataset and in fluorescent-labeled fixed bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells samples. RESULTS: Conventional ML models without DenseED blocks trained on small datasets fail to accurately estimate SR images while models including the DenseED blocks can. The average peak SNR (PSNR) and resolution improvements achieved by networks containing DenseED blocks are   approximately  3.2  dB and 2 x  , respectively. We evaluated various configurations of target image generation methods (e.g., experimentally captured a target and computationally generated target) that are used to train FCNs with and without DenseED blocks and showed that including DenseED blocks in simple FCNs outperforms compared to simple FCNs without DenseED blocks. CONCLUSIONS: DenseED blocks in neural networks show accurate extraction of SR images even if the ML model is trained with a small training dataset of 15 FOVs. This approach shows that microscopy applications can use DenseED blocks to train on smaller datasets that are application-specific imaging platforms and there is promise for applying this to other imaging modalities, such as MRI/x-ray, etc."

METHODS: A total of 319 sectioned images of the brainstem were selected from whole-body axial sectioned images, then coronal and sagittal sectioned images were reconstructed from the horizontal images. The fine and detailed structures were annotated in PowerPoint slides, then the volume model was produced and some white matter fibers were traced using MRIcroGL. RESULTS: In this study, a novel brainstem atlas based on sectioned images was generated that shows the true color and shape, as well as the accurate location of the nuclei and tracts; it reveals the striking contrast between gray and white matter, as well as fine structures. In total, 212 structures, including nuclei and tracts, were annotated in axial, coronal, and sagittal plane views of sectioned images (48-bit true color; 0.2 mm intervals, 0.06 mm x 0.06 mm pixel size). To verify the accuracy of the annotations, a volume model of the brainstem was constructed for independent observations of the three planes. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we describe several interesting structures included in the atlas. By depicting the fine structures of the human brainstem in detail, this atlas allows comprehensive understanding of the complicated topographies of the brainstem. As such, it will be of value for neuroanatomy education and research, in addition to enriching the literature on the human brain."

Deep learning models are already saving lives in the medical field due to their capacity to distinguish between benign and malignant tumours. Histopathology imaging poses difficulties due to the possibility of large colour variations caused by the staining technique and the biopsy material used to make the image; this problem leads to inaccurate breast cancer diagnoses. Our primary focus in this assessment is on the four main research concerns listed in the following: Overfitting and colour divergence must be rectified before moving on to other aspects of breast cancer categorisation. To overcome this issue, strain normalisation is utilised, and adding extra components is used to cope with overfitting; both techniques yielded positive results. The multiscale stochastic and dilation unit was then created to extract and enhance fine-grained characteristics such as edges, contours, and colour accuracy. To achieve this, the image is scaled to various different levels. The last challenge is to overcome the stochastic dilated residual ghost model's unreliability when used to recognise very tiny objects. The stochastic pooling block in this model makes effective use of downsampling to simplify the process without compromising the capacity to retrieve deep information. This upgrade was done as part of a bigger endeavour to eliminate unneeded or redundant components. In this case, we use convolution and identity mapping to create and maintain accurate mappings of the object's inherent characteristics. Upsampling is frequently used in conjunction with stochastic pooling to reduce feature dimensionality. The results of the experiments show that the suggested method is better than some of the current methods, with a network performance measurement area under the curve of 96.15 and percentages of 98.50 and 97.36."

Specifically, we design a nucleus segmentation framework, namely ClusterSeg, to tackle nuclei clusters, which consists of a convolutional-transformer hybrid encoder and a 2.5-path decoder for precise predictions of nuclei instance mask, contours, and clustered-edges. Additionally, an annotation-efficient clustered-edge pointed strategy pinpoints the salient and error-prone boundaries, where a partially-supervised PS-ClusterSeg is presented using ClusterSeg as the segmentation backbone. The framework is evaluated with four privately curated image sets and two public sets with characteristic severely clustered nuclei across a variety range of image modalities, e.g., microscope, cytopathology, and histopathology images. The proposed ClusterSeg and PS-ClusterSeg are modality-independent and generalizable, and superior to current state-of-the-art approaches in multiple metrics empirically.

However, optimal performance is usually reached using laser-based systems (for example, confocal microscopy), restricting its broad applicability in clinical pathology, as most centres have access only to light-emitting diode (LED)-based widefield systems. As a possible alternative, a computational method for image resolution enhancement, namely, super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF)(2,3), has recently been developed. However, this method has not been explored in pathology specimens to date, because on its own, it does not achieve sufficient resolution for routine clinical use. Here, we report expansion-enhanced super-resolution radial fluctuations (ExSRRF), a simple, robust, scalable and accessible workflow that provides a resolution of up to 25 nm using LED-based widefield microscopy. ExSRRF enables molecular profiling of subcellular structures from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues in complex clinical and experimental specimens, including ischaemic, degenerative, neoplastic, genetic and immune-mediated disorders. Furthermore, as examples of its potential application to experimental and clinical pathology, we show that ExSRRF can be used to identify and quantify classical features of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the murine ischaemic kidney and diagnostic ultrastructural features in human kidney biopsies."

Here, we present a principled veridical data science methodology for quantitative histology that shifts focus from image-level investigations towards neuron-level representations of cortical regions, with the neurons in the image as a subject of study, rather than pixel-wise image content. Our methodology relies on the automatic segmentation of neurons across whole histological sections and an extensive set of engineered features, which reflect the neuronal phenotype of individual neurons and the properties of neurons' neighborhoods. The neuron-level representations are used in an interpretable machine learning pipeline for mapping the phenotype to cortical layers. To validate our approach, we created a unique dataset of cortical layers manually annotated by three experts in neuroanatomy and histology. The presented methodology offers high interpretability of the results, providing a deeper understanding of human cortex organization, which may help formulate new scientific hypotheses, as well as to cope with systematic uncertainty in data and model predictions."

Epub 2023 Feb 24.,Barua B,Comput Med Imaging Graph,2023,2023/03/01,,,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2023.102202,"Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent type of oral cancer across the globe. Histopathology examination is the gold standard for OSCC examination, where stained histopathology slides help in studying and analyzing the cell structures under a microscope to determine the stages and grading of OSCC. One of the staining methods popularly known as H&E staining is used to produce differential coloration, highlight key tissue features, and improve contrast, which makes cell analysis easier. However, the stained H&E histopathology images exhibit inter and intra-variation due to staining techniques, incubation times, and staining reagents. These variations negatively impact computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and Machine learning algorithm's accuracy and development. A pre-processing procedure called stain normalization must be employed to reduce stain variance's negative impacts. Numerous state-of-the-art stain normalization methods are introduced. However, a robust multi-domain stain normalization approach is still required because, in a real-world situation, the OSCC histopathology images will include more than two color variations involving several domains. In this paper, a multi-domain stain translation method is proposed. The proposed method is an attention gated generator based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) with a novel objective function to enforce color distribution and the perpetual resemblance between the source and target domains. Instead of using WSI scanner images like previous techniques, the proposed method is experimented on OSCC histopathology images obtained by several conventional microscopes coupled with cameras. The proposed method receives the L* channel from the L*a*b* color space in inference mode and generates the G(a*b*) channel, which are color-adapted. The proposed technique uses mappings learned during training phases to translate the source domain to the target domain; mapping are learned using the whole color distribution of the target domain instead of one reference image. The suggested technique outperforms the four state-of-the-art methods in multi-domain OSCC histopathological translation, the claim is supported by results obtained after assessment in both quantitative and qualitative ways."

This method generates new realizations of the placenta intervillous morphology while maintaining the general textures and orientations. As a result, a diversified artificial dataset of images is generated that can be used for training deep learning segmentation models. We have observed that on average the presented method of data augmentation led to a 42% decrease in the binary cross-entropy loss of the validation dataset compared to the common approach in the literature. Additionally, the morphology of the intervillous space is studied under the effect of the proposed image reconstruction technique, and the diversity of the artificially generated population is quantified. We have demonstrated that the proposed method results in a more accurate morphological characterization of the placental intervillous space with an average feature relative error of 6.5%, which is significantly lower than the 11.5% error observed with conventional augmentation techniques. Due to the high resemblance of the generated images to the real ones, applications of the proposed method may not be limited to placental histological images, and it is recommended that other types of tissue be investigated in future studies."

Epub 2023 Mar 26.,Altini N,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2023,2023/04/03,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107511,"BACKGROUND: Histological assessment of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue is a crucial and demanding task for pathologists. Unfortunately, manual annotation by trained specialists is a burdensome operation, which suffers from problems like intra- and inter-pathologist variability. Computational models are revolutionizing the Digital Pathology field, offering reliable and fast approaches for challenges like tissue segmentation and classification. With this respect, an important obstacle to overcome consists in stain color variations among different laboratories, which can decrease the performance of classifiers. In this work, we investigated the role of Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (UI2IT) models for stain color normalization in CRC histology and compared to classical normalization techniques for Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) images. METHODS: Five Deep Learning normalization models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) belonging to the UI2IT paradigm have been thoroughly compared to realize a robust stain color normalization pipeline. To avoid the need for training a style transfer GAN between each pair of data domains, in this paper we introduce the concept of training by exploiting a meta-domain, which contains data coming from a wide variety of laboratories. The proposed framework enables a huge saving in terms of training time, by allowing to train a single image normalization model for a target laboratory. To prove the applicability of the proposed workflow in the clinical practice, we conceived a novel perceptive quality measure, which we defined as Pathologist Perceptive Quality (PPQ). The second stage involved the classification of tissue types in CRC histology, where deep features extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks have been exploited to realize a Computer-Aided Diagnosis system based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM). To prove the reliability of the system on new data, an external validation set composed of N = 15,857 tiles has been collected at IRCCS Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II"". RESULTS: The exploitation of a meta-domain consented to train normalization models that allowed achieving better classification results than normalization models explicitly trained on the source domain. PPQ metric has been found correlated to quality of distributions (Frechet Inception Distance - FID) and to similarity of the transformed image to the original one (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity - LPIPS), thus showing that GAN quality measures introduced in natural image processing tasks can be linked to pathologist evaluation of H&E images. Furthermore, FID has been found correlated to accuracies of the downstream classifiers. The SVM trained on DenseNet201 features allowed to obtain the highest classification results in all configurations. The normalization method based on the fast variant of CUT (Contrastive Unpaired Translation), FastCUT, trained with the meta-domain paradigm, allowed to achieve the best classification result for the downstream task and, correspondingly, showed the highest FID on the classification dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Stain color normalization is a difficult but fundamental problem in the histopathological setting. Several measures should be considered for properly assessing normalization methods, so that they can be introduced in the clinical practice. UI2IT frameworks offer a powerful and effective way to perform the normalization process, providing realistic images with proper colorization, unlike traditional normalization methods that introduce color artifacts. By adopting the proposed meta-domain framework, the training time can be reduced, and the accuracy of downstream classifiers can be increased."

However, robust and accurate cell nuclei segmentation is challenging due to the enormous variability of staining, cell sizes, morphologies, cell adhesion or overlapping of the nucleus. The automation process to find the cell's nuclei is a giant leap in this direction and has an important step toward bioimage analysis using software tools. This article extensively analyzes deep U-Net architecture and has been applied to the Data Science Bowl dataset to segment the cell nuclei. The dataset undergoes various preprocessing tasks such as resizing, intensity normalization and data augmentation prior to segmentation. The complete dataset then undergoes the rigorous training and validation process to find the optimized hyperparameters and then the optimized model selection. The mean (m) +/- standard deviation (SD) of Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1-score (Dice score) have been calculated along with accuracy during the training and validation process, respectively. The optimized U-Net model results in a training IoU of 0.94 +/- 0.16 (m +/- SD), an F1-score of 0.94 +/- 0.17 (m +/- SD), a training accuracy of 95.54 and validation accuracy of 95.45. With this model, we applied a completely independent test cohort of the dataset and obtained the mean IOU of 0.93, F1-score of 0.9311, and mean accuracy of 94.12, respectively to measure the segmentation performance."

This study integrates various computer vision tools to develop a fully automated workflow for quantifying Ki-67, a standard IHC test used to assess cell proliferation on digital whole slide images (WSIs). METHODS: We create an automated nuclear segmentation strategy by deploying a Mask R-CNN classifier to recognise and count 3,3'-diaminobenzidine positive and negative nuclei. To further improve automation, we replaced manual selection of regions of interest (ROIs) by aligning Ki-67 WSIs with corresponding H&E-stained sections, using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and a conventional histomorphological convolutional neural networks to define tumour-rich areas for quantification. RESULTS: The Mask R-CNN was tested on 147 images generated from 34 brain tumour Ki-67 WSIs and showed a high concordance with aggregate pathologists' estimates ([Formula: see text] assessors; [Formula: see text] r=0.9750). Concordance of each assessor's Ki-67 estimates was higher when compared with the Mask R-CNN than between individual assessors (r(avg)=0.9322 vs 0.8703; p=0.0213). Coupling the Mask R-CNN with SIFT-CNN workflow demonstrated ROIs can be automatically chosen and partially sampled to improve automation and dramatically decrease computational time (average: 88.55-19.28 min; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We show how innovations in computer vision can be serially compounded to automate and improve implementation in clinical workflows. Generalisation of this approach to other ancillary studies has significant implications for computational pathology."

The identification of subtypes of tumour tissue complicates the issue as the sharpness of separation decreases and the pathologist's reasoning is even more guided by spatial context. However, the identification of detailed tissue types is crucial for providing personalized cancer therapies. Due to the high resolution of whole slide images, existing semantic segmentation methods, restricted to isolated image sections, are incapable of processing context information beyond. To take a step towards better context comprehension, we propose a patch neighbour attention mechanism to query the neighbouring tissue context from a patch embedding memory bank and infuse context embeddings into bottleneck hidden feature maps. Our memory attention framework (MAF) mimics a pathologist's annotation procedure - zooming out and considering surrounding tissue context. The framework can be integrated into any encoder-decoder segmentation method. We evaluate the MAF on two public breast cancer and liver cancer data sets and an internal kidney cancer data set using famous segmentation models (U-Net, DeeplabV3) and demonstrate the superiority over other context-integrating algorithms - achieving a substantial improvement of up to 17% on Dice score.

In this study, we propose a multiresolution attention-based multiple instance learning framework that can capture cellular and contextual features from the whole tissue for predicting patient-level outcomes. Several basic mathematical operations were examined for integrating multiresolution features, i.e. addition, mean, multiplication and concatenation.

Histological image segmentation is often constrained by the availability of labeled training data since labeling histological images is a highly skilled, complex, and time-consuming task. Thus, data augmentation strategies become essential to train convolutional neural networks models to overcome the overfitting problem when only a few training samples are available. This paper proposes a new data augmentation strategy, named Random Composition Augmentation (RCAug), to train fully convolutional networks (FCN) to segment OSCC tumor regions in H &E-stained histological images. Given the input image and their corresponding label, a pipeline with a random composition of geometric, distortion, color transfer, and generative image transformations is executed on the fly. Experimental evaluations were performed using an FCN-based method to segment OSCC regions through a set of different data augmentation transformations. By using RCAug, we improved the FCN-based segmentation method from 0.51 to 0.81 of intersection-over-union (IOU) in a whole slide image dataset and from 0.65 to 0.69 of IOU in a tissue microarray images dataset."

Epub 2023 Aug 7.,Alam MS,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,2023,2023/04/04,,,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3227540,"Medical image segmentation is critical for efficient diagnosis of diseases and treatment planning. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based methods, particularly U-Net and its variants, have achieved remarkable results on medical image segmentation tasks. However, they do not always work consistently on images with complex structures and large variations in regions of interest (ROI). This could be due to the fixed geometric structure of the receptive fields used for feature extraction and repetitive down-sampling operations that lead to information loss. To overcome these problems, the standard U-Net architecture is modified in this work by replacing the convolution block with a dilated convolution block to extract multi-scale context features with varying sizes of receptive fields, and adding a dilated inception block between the encoder and decoder paths to alleviate the problem of information recession and the semantic gap between features. Furthermore, the input of each dilated convolution block is added to the output through a squeeze and excitation unit, which alleviates the vanishing gradient problem and improves overall feature representation by re-weighting the channel-wise feature responses. The original inception block is modified by reducing the size of the spatial filter and introducing dilated convolution to obtain a larger receptive field. The proposed network was validated on three challenging medical image segmentation tasks with varying size ROIs: lung segmentation on chest X-ray (CXR) images, skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopy images and nucleus segmentation on microscopy cell images. Improved performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates the effectiveness and generalisability of the proposed Dilated Convolution and Inception blocks-based U-Net (DCI-UNet)."

In this work, the authors study the application of lossy image coding to compress high-resolution volumetric biomedical data. The impact of compression on the metrics and interpretation of volumetric data was quantified for a correlated multimodal imaging study to characterize murine tumor vasculature, using volumetric high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM), micro-computed tomography (microCT), and micro-magnetic resonance imaging (microMRI). The effects of compression were assessed by measuring task-specific performances of several biomedical experts who interpreted and labeled multiple data volumes compressed at different degrees. We defined trade-offs between data volume reduction and preservation of visual information, which ensured the preservation of relevant vasculature morphology at maximum compression efficiency across scales. Using the Jaccard Index (JI) and the average Hausdorff Distance (HD) after vasculature segmentation, we could demonstrate that, in this study, compression that yields to a 256-fold reduction of the data size allowed to keep the error induced by compression below the inter-observer variability, with minimal impact on the assessment of the tumor vasculature across scales."

A scan aid was applied in such situation and evaluated for intraoral scanning accuracy in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 87 implants in 22 patients were scanned with scan aid (SA) and without scan aid (NO) using two different intraoral scanners (CS3600 [CS] and TRIOS3 [TR]). Master casts were digitized by a laboratory scanner. Virtual models were superimposed using an inspection software and Linear deviation and precision were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models (alpha = .05). RESULTS: Total mean linear deviation within the CS group was 189 mum without scan aid and 135 mum when using the scan aid. The TR group's total mean deviation was 165 mum with and without a scan aid. Significant improvement with scan aid was observed for the CS group (p = .001), and no difference was found in the TR group. 96% of scan bodies were successfully scanned in the TR-SA group compared to 86% for the TR-NO group, 83% for the CS-SA, and 70% for the CS-NO group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated scan aid improved linear deviation compared to unsplinted scans for the CS group but not for the TR group. These differences could originate from different scanning technologies used, active triangulation (CS) and confocal microscopy (TR). The scan aid improved the ability to recognize scan bodies successfully with both systems, which could have a favorable clinical impact overall."

A key aspect of breast cancer research is understanding the distinct morphological features of cancerous and non-cancerous cells, which could serve as potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions. In this light, our study aimed to comprehensively analyze the morphological features of the MCF10A and MCF7 cell lines, representing normal breast and breast cancer cells, respectively. The ultimate objective was to identify the most significant features that differentiate these cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized advanced imaging techniques such as holographic time-lapse microscopy, which provides real-time, three-dimensional imaging of cells, to conduct our comparative analysis. This allowed us to examine dynamic cellular morphology and behavior with exceptional sensitivity and resolution over time. The primary features assessed in our study included texture clustershade, area (mum(2)), eccentricity, irregularity, phaseshift sum, optical volume (mum(3)), shape convexity, and Hull convexity. RESULTS: Our findings highlighted significant differences in the morphological features of MCF10A and MCF7 cells. MCF10A cells showed a higher texture clustershade value, suggesting less symmetry than MCF7 cells. On the other hand, MCF7 cells had smaller cellular area, higher eccentricity, lower irregularity, higher phase shift sum, higher optical volume, higher shape convexity, and higher hull convexity compared to MCF10A cells. These results suggest that MCF7 cells are smaller, more circular, less irregular, exhibit different light properties, and have a closer to perfect 3D shape relative to MCF10A cells. CONCLUSION: The identified morphological differences between MCF10A and MCF7 cells offer valuable insights into the characteristics distinguishing normal breast cells from breast cancer cells. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of the morphological variability in breast cancer but also underscore the potential utility of these differences in future cancer diagnostics and treatment strategies."

However, manual counting of BCs using microscope images is time consuming and subjective. Moreover, traditional image processing approaches perform poorly due to the limitations in staining quality and the diversity of morphological features in binuclear cell (BC) microscopy whole-slide images (WSIs). To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-task method inspired by the structure prior of BCs based on deep learning, which cascades to implement BC coarse detection at the WSI level and fine-grained classification at the patch level. The coarse detection network is a multitask detection framework based on circular bounding boxes for cell detection and central key points for nucleus detection. Circle representation reduces the degrees of freedom, mitigates the effect of surrounding impurities compared to usual rectangular boxes and can be rotation invariant in WSIs. Detecting key points in the nucleus can assist in network perception and be used for unsupervised color layer segmentation in later fine-grained classification. The fine classification network consists of a background region suppression module based on color layer mask supervision and a key region selection module based on a transformer due to its global modeling capability. Additionally, an unsupervised and unpaired cytoplasm generator network is first proposed to expand the long-tailed distribution dataset. Finally, experiments are performed on BC multicenter datasets. The proposed BC fine detection method outperforms other benchmarks in almost all evaluation criteria, providing clarification and support for tasks such as cancer screenings."

The resulting differences in image characteristics may lead to drifts in clinically relevant performance metrics which could cause harm in clinical decision making, even for models that generalise in terms of area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve. We propose Unsupervised Prediction Alignment, a generic automatic recalibration method that requires no ground truth annotations and only limited amounts of unlabelled example images from the shifted data distribution. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to detect and correct performance drift in mammography-based breast cancer screening and on publicly available histopathology data. We show that the proposed method can preserve the expected performance in terms of sensitivity/specificity under various realistic scenarios of image acquisition shift, thus offering an important safeguard for clinical deployment."

Epub 2023 Sep 22.,Sun M,Comput Biol Med,2023,2023/10/01,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107527,"In pathological image analysis, determination of gland morphology in histology images of the colon is essential to determine the grade of colon cancer. However, manual segmentation of glands is extremely challenging and there is a need to develop automatic methods for segmenting gland instances. Recently, due to the powerful noise-to-image denoising pipeline, the diffusion model has become one of the hot spots in computer vision research and has been explored in the field of image segmentation. In this paper, we propose an instance segmentation method based on the diffusion model that can perform automatic gland instance segmentation. Firstly, we model the instance segmentation process for colon histology images as a denoising process based on a diffusion model. Secondly, to recover details lost during denoising, we use Instance Aware Filters and multi-scale Mask Branch to construct global mask instead of predicting only local masks. Thirdly, to improve the distinction between the object and the background, we apply Conditional Encoding to enhance the intermediate features with the original image encoding. To objectively validate the proposed method, we compared several state-of-the-art deep learning models on the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation challenge (GlaS) dataset (165 images), the Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Glands (CRAG) dataset (213 images) and the RINGS dataset (1500 images). Our proposed method obtains significantly improved results for CRAG (Object F1 0.853 +/- 0.054, Object Dice 0.906 +/- 0.043), GlaS Test A (Object F1 0.941 +/- 0.039, Object Dice 0.939 +/- 0.060), GlaS Test B (Object F1 0.893 +/- 0.073, Object Dice 0.889 +/- 0.069), and RINGS dataset (Precision 0.893 +/- 0.096, Dice 0.904 +/- 0.091). The experimental results show that our method significantly improves the segmentation accuracy, and the experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of the method."

An emerging field that addresses this problem is Explainable AI. METHODS: Here, we aimed to investigate the ability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify head and neck cancer histopathology. To this end, we manually annotated 101 histopathological slides of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We trained a CNN to classify tumor and non-tumor tissue, and another CNN to semantically segment four classes - tumor, non-tumor, non-specified tissue, and background. We applied Explainable AI techniques, namely Grad-CAM and HR-CAM, to both networks and explored important features that contributed to their decisions. RESULTS: The classification network achieved an accuracy of 89.9% on previously unseen data. Our segmentation network achieved a class-averaged Intersection over Union score of 0.690, and 0.782 for tumor tissue in particular. Explainable AI methods demonstrated that both networks rely on features agreeing with the pathologist's expert opinion. CONCLUSION: Our work suggests that CNNs can predict head and neck cancer with high accuracy. Especially if accompanied by visual explanations, CNNs seem promising for assisting pathologists in the assessment of cancer sections."

Portable fluorescence microscopes have been developed for these measurements, however, quantitative assessment of the quality of images (micro-nanoparticles, and leukocytes) captured using these devices remains a challenge. Here, we present a novel method for automated quality assessment of fluorescent images (AQAFI) captured using smartphone fluorescence microscopes (SFM). AQAFI utilizes novel feature extraction methods to identify and measure multiple features of interest in leukocyte and micro-nanoparticle images. For validation of AQAFI, fluorescent particles of different diameters (8.3, 2, 1, 0.8 mum) were imaged using custom-designed SFM at a range of excitation voltages (3.8-4.5 V). Particle intensity, particle vicinity intensity, and image background noise were chosen as analytical parameters of interest and measured by the AQAFI algorithm. A control method was developed by manual calculation of these parameters using ImageJ which was subsequently used to validate the performance of the AQAFI method. For micro-nanoparticle images, correlation coefficients with R(2) > 0.95 were obtained for each parameter of interest while comparing AQAFI vs. control (ImageJ). Subsequently, key performance indicators (KPIs) i.e., signal difference to noise ratio (SDNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) were defined and calculated for these micro-nano particle images using both AQAFI and control methods. Finally, we tested the performance of the AQAFI method on the fluorescent images of human peripheral blood leukocytes captured using our custom SFM. Correlation coefficients of R(2) = 0.99 were obtained for each parameter of interest (leukocyte intensity, vicinity intensity, background noise) calculated using AQAFI and control (ImageJ). A high correlation was also found between the CNR and SDNR values calculated using both methods. The developed AQAFI method thus presents an automated and precise way to quantify and assess the quality of fluorescent images (micro-nano particles and leukocytes) captured using portable SFMs. Similarly, this study finds broader applicability and can also be employed with benchtop microscopes for the quantitative assessment of their imaging performance."

Histology can provide wall information but is typically restricted to ex vivo 2D slices where the shape of the tissue is altered. METHODS: We developed a visual exploration pipeline for a comprehensive view of an IA. We extract multimodal information (like stain classification and segmentation of histologic images) and combine them via 2D to 3D mapping and virtual inflation of deformed tissue. Histological data, including four stains, micro-CT data and segmented calcifications as well as hemodynamic information like wall shear stress (WSS), are combined with the 3D model of the resected aneurysm. RESULTS: Calcifications were mostly present in the tissue part with increased WSS. In the 3D model, an area of increased wall thickness was identified and correlated to histology, where the Oil red O (ORO) stained images showed a lipid accumulation and the alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) stained images showed a slight loss of muscle cells. CONCLUSION: Our visual exploration pipeline combines multimodal information about the aneurysm wall to improve the understanding of wall changes and IA development. The user can identify regions and correlate how hemodynamic forces, e.g. WSS, are reflected by histological structures of the vessel wall, wall thickness and calcifications."

Accordingly, prepending manual quality control of artifacts considerably decreases the degree of automation. To close this gap, we propose a methodical pre-processing framework to detect and restore artifacts, which minimizes their impact on downstream AI diagnostic tasks. First, the artifact recognition network AR-Classifier first differentiates common artifacts from normal tissues, e.g., tissue folds, marking dye, tattoo pigment, spot, and out-of-focus, and also catalogs artifact patches by their restorability. Then, the succeeding artifact restoration network AR-CycleGAN performs de-artifact processing where stain styles and tissue structures can be maximally retained. We construct a benchmark for performance evaluation, curated from both clinically collected WSIs and public datasets of colorectal and breast cancer. The functional structures are compared with state-of-the-art methods, and also comprehensively evaluated by multiple metrics across multiple tasks, including artifact classification, artifact restoration, downstream diagnostic tasks of tumor classification and nuclei segmentation. The proposed system allows full automation of deep learning based histology image analysis without human intervention. Moreover, the structure-independent characteristic enables its processing with various artifact subtypes.

However, structural heterogeneity limits resolution in many practical cases, hence restricting the level at which structural details can be analysed and drug design be performed. As structural disorder is not spread throughout the entire structure of a given macromolecular complex but instead is found in certain regions that move with respect to others and covering molecular scales from domain conformational changes up to the level of side chain conformations in ligand binding pockets, it is possible to focus the attention on those regions and the associated relative movements. Here we show how the usage of focused classifications and refinements provide insights into global conformational arrangements, exemplified on the human ribosome and on the cannabinoid G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), and how they can improve the local map resolution from an essentially disordered region to the 3-4 A and finally to the 2 A resolution range. A systematic analysis with variable spherical masks during focused refinement is presented showing that the choice of an optimal mask size helps refining to high resolution. This study covers several practical approaches on 4 examples illustrating how important mask size & shape and including neighbouring structural elements are for a focused analysis of a macromolecular complex. Such methods will be crucial for cryo-EM structure-based drug design of various medical targets and are applicable to single particle cryo-EM and electron tomography data."

If organ-confined, removal of the prostate through radical prostatectomy is considered curative; however, distant metastases may occur, resulting in a poor patient prognosis. This study sought to determine whether quantitative pathomic features of prostate cancer differ in patients who biochemically experience biological recurrence after surgery. Whole-mount prostate histology from 78 patients was analyzed for this study. In total, 614 slides were hematoxylin and eosin stained and digitized to produce whole slide images (WSI). Regions of differing Gleason patterns were digitally annotated by a genitourinary fellowship-trained pathologist, and high-resolution tiles were extracted from each annotated region of interest for further analysis. Individual glands within the prostate were identified using automated image processing algorithms, and histomorphometric features were calculated on a per-tile basis and across WSI and averaged by patients. Tiles were organized into cancer and benign tissues. Logistic regression models were fit to assess the predictive value of the calculated pathomic features across tile groups and WSI; additionally, models using clinical information were used for comparisons. Logistic regression classified each pathomic feature model at accuracies >80% with areas under the curve of 0.82, 0.76, 0.75, and 0.72 for all tiles, cancer only, noncancer only, and across WSI. This was comparable with standard clinical information, Gleason Grade Groups, and CAPRA score, which achieved similar accuracies but areas under the curve of 0.80, 0.77, and 0.70, respectively. This study demonstrates that the use of quantitative pathomic features calculated from digital histology of prostate cancer may provide clinicians with additional information beyond the traditional qualitative pathologist assessment. Further research is warranted to determine possible inclusion in treatment guidance."

However, due to the relatively small proportion of the pancreas in the abdomen and significant shape and size variations, pancreatic tumor segmentation poses considerable challenges. PURPOSE: To construct a network model that combines a pyramid pooling module with Inception architecture and SE attention mechanism (PIS-Unet), and observe its effectiveness in pancreatic tumor images segmentation, thereby providing supportive recommendations for clinical practitioners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 303 patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic cystic neoplasm (PCN), including serous cystic neoplasm (SCN) and mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), from Shanghai Changhai Hospital between March 2011 and November 2021 were included. A total of 1792 T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) slices were used to build a CNN model. The model employed a pyramid pooling Inception module with a fused attention mechanism. The attention mechanism enhanced the network's focus on local features, while the Inception module and pyramid pooling allowed the network to extract features at different scales and improve the utilization efficiency of global information, thereby effectively enhancing network performance. RESULTS: Using three-fold cross-validation, the model constructed by us achieved a dice score of 85.49 +/- 2.02 for SCN images segmentation, and a dice score of 87.90 +/- 4.19 for MCN images segmentation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that using deep learning networks for the segmentation of PCNs yields favorable results. Applying this network as an aid to physicians in PCN diagnosis shows potential for clinical applications."

However, treatment-related pseudoprogression presents with similar imaging features but requires different clinical management. While pathologic diagnosis is the gold standard to differentiate true progression and pseudoprogression, the lack of objective clinical standards and admixed histologic presentation creates the needs to (1) validate the accuracy of current approaches and (2) characterize differences between these entities to objectively differentiate true disease. We demonstrated using an online RNAseq repository of recurrent glioblastoma samples that cancer-immune cell activity levels correlate with heterogenous clinical outcomes in patients. Furthermore, nCounter RNA expression analysis of 48 clinical samples taken from second neurosurgical resection supports that pseudoprogression gene expression pathways are dominated with immune activation, whereas progression is predominated with cell cycle activity. Automated image processing and spatial expression analysis however highlight a failure to apply these broad expressional differences in a subset of cases with clinically challenging admixed histology. Encouragingly, applying unsupervised clustering approaches over our segmented histologic images provides novel understanding of morphologically derived differences between progression and pseudoprogression. Spatially derived data further highlighted polarization of myeloid populations that may underscore the tumorgenicity of novel lesions. These findings not only help provide further clarity of potential targets for pathologists to better assist stratification of progression and pseudoprogression, but also highlight the evolution of tumor-immune microenvironment changes which promote tumor recurrence."

In clinical research, heterogeneity has important implications in the correct detection and interpretation of prognostic markers and in the analysis of patient-derived material. Among single-cell analysis, imaging flow cytometry allows combining information retrieved by single cell images with the throughput of fluidic platforms. Nevertheless, these techniques might fail in a comprehensive heterogeneity evaluation because of limited image resolution and bidimensional analysis. Light sheet fluorescence microscopy opened new ways to study in 3D the complexity of cellular functionality in samples ranging from single-cells to micro-tissues, with remarkably fast acquisition and low photo-toxicity. In addition, structured illumination microscopy has been applied to single-cell studies enhancing the resolution of imaging beyond the conventional diffraction limit. The combination of these techniques in a microfluidic environment, which permits automatic sample delivery and translation, would allow exhaustive investigation of cellular heterogeneity with high throughput image acquisition at high resolution. Here we propose an integrated optofluidic platform capable of performing structured light sheet imaging flow cytometry (SLS-IFC). The system encompasses a multicolor directional coupler equipped with a thermo-optic phase shifter, cylindrical lenses and a microfluidic network to generate and shift a patterned light sheet within a microchannel. The absence of moving parts allows a stable alignment and an automated fluorescence signal acquisition during the sample flow. The platform enables 3D imaging of an entire cell in about 1 s with a resolution enhancement capable of revealing sub-cellular features and sub-diffraction limit details."

New high-resolution fast-scanning instruments combined with currently existing equipment were tested in a nephropathology hub to evaluate possible upgrading in the routine processing phases. METHODS: The scanning performance of two different instruments (Aperio vs hybrid MIDI II) was evaluated and a comparative quality control check was performed on obtained whole slide images. RESULTS: Both with default and custom settings for light microscopy, MIDI II proved to be faster, with only slightly more time required to prepare the scan and larger final file size as compared to Aperio (p < 0.001). No differences were noted in the number of out-of-focus slides per case (p = 0.75). Regarding immunofluorescence, the new scanner required longer preparation time (p = 0.001) with comparable scanning times and final file size (p = 0.169 and p = 0.177, respectively). Quality control showed differences in 3 quality features related to white background and blurriness (p < 0.001). No major discordances in the final diagnosis were recorded after comparing the report obtained with slides scanned using the two instruments, with only one case (4%) showing minor disagreement. CONCLUSION: The present report describes the experience of a hub nephropathology center adopting next generation digital pathology tools for the routine assessment of renal biopsies, highlighting the need for a complementary approach towards a philosophy of interoperability."

In cases where the number of training samples is limited, synthetic computer-generated data sets can be used to improve these methods. This requires the synthesis of cell shapes as well as corresponding microscopy images using generative models. To synthesize realistic living cell shapes, the shape representation used by the generative model should be able to accurately represent fine details and changes in topology, which are common in cells. These requirements are not met by 3D voxel masks, which are restricted in resolution, and polygon meshes, which do not easily model processes like cell growth and mitosis. In this work, we propose to represent living cell shapes as level sets of signed distance functions (SDFs) which are estimated by neural networks. We optimize a fully-connected neural network to provide an implicit representation of the SDF value at any point in a 3D+time domain, conditioned on a learned latent code that is disentangled from the rotation of the cell shape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on cells that exhibit rapid deformations (Platynereis dumerilii), cells that grow and divide (C. elegans), and cells that have growing and branching filopodial protrusions (A549 human lung carcinoma cells). A quantitative evaluation using shape features and Dice similarity coefficients of real and synthetic cell shapes shows that our model can generate topologically plausible complex cell shapes in 3D+time with high similarity to real living cell shapes. Finally, we show how microscopy images of living cells that correspond to our generated cell shapes can be synthesized using an image-to-image model."

In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) methods have been shown to perform well on segmentation tasks but DL methods generally require a large amount of pixel-wise annotated data. Pixel-wise annotation sometimes requires expert's knowledge and time which is laborious and costly to obtain. In this paper, we present a consistency based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that can help mitigate this challenge by exploiting a large amount of unlabelled data for model training thus alleviating the need for a large annotated dataset. However, SSL models might also be susceptible to changing context and features perturbations exhibiting poor generalisation due to the limited training data. We propose an SSL method that learns robust features from both labelled and unlabelled images by enforcing consistency against varying contexts and feature perturbations. The proposed method incorporates context-aware consistency by contrasting pairs of overlapping images in a pixel-wise manner from changing contexts resulting in robust and context invariant features. We show that cross-consistency training makes the encoder features invariant to different perturbations and improves the prediction confidence. Finally, entropy minimisation is employed to further boost the confidence of the final prediction maps from unlabelled data. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on two publicly available large datasets (BCSS and MoNuSeg) and show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

HiPS uses deep learning to accurately map cellular and tissue structures to measure epithelial, stromal, immune, and spatial interaction features. It was developed using a population-level cohort from the Cancer Prevention Study-II and validated using data from three independent cohorts, including the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer trial, Cancer Prevention Study-3, and The Cancer Genome Atlas. HiPS consistently outperformed pathologists in predicting survival outcomes, independent of tumor-node-metastasis stage and pertinent variables.

And the traditional data feature extraction technology has been gradually replaced by the feature extraction technology based on convolutional neural network which helps to realize the automatic recognition and classification of pathological images. In this paper, a novel method based on deep learning and wavelet transform is proposed to classify the pathological images of breast cancer. Firstly, the image flip technique is used to expand the data set, then the two-level wavelet decomposition and reconfiguration technology is used to sharpen and enhance the pathological images. Secondly, the processed data set is divided into the training set and the test set according to 8:2 and 7:3, and the YOLOv8 network model is selected to perform the eight classification tasks of breast cancer pathological images. Finally, the classification accuracy of the proposed method is compared with the classification accuracy obtained by YOLOv8 for the original BreaKHis dataset, and it is found that the algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of images with different magnifications, which proves the effectiveness of combining two-level wavelet decomposition and reconfiguration with YOLOv8 network model."

CellOrganizer is an open-source system for using microscope images to learn statistical models of the structure of cell components and how those components are organized relative to each other. Such models capture the statistical variation in the organization of cellular components by jointly modeling the distributions of their number, shape, and spatial distributions. These models can be created for different cell types or conditions and compared to reflect differences in their spatial organizations. The models are also generative, in that they can be used to synthesize new cell instances reflecting what a model learned and to provide well-structured cell geometries that can be used for biochemical simulations."

ST platforms, like the 10x Visium technology investigated herein, therefore produce in a single experiment simultaneously thousands of RNA readouts, captured by an array of micrometer scale spots under the histological section. Therefore, a central challenge of analyzing ST experiments consists of analyzing the gene expression morphology of all spots to delineate clusters of similar cell mixtures, which are then compared to each other to identify up- or down-regulated marker genes. Moreover, another level of complexity in ST experiments, compared to traditional RNA-Seq, is imposed by staining the tissue section with protein markers of cells or cell components to identify spots providing relevant information afterward. The corresponding microscopy images need to be analyzed in addition to the RNA-Seq read mappings on the reference genome and transcriptome sequences. Focusing on the software suite provided by the Visium platform manufacturer, we break down the ST analysis pipeline into its four essential steps-the image analysis, the read alignment, the gene quantification, and the spot clustering-and compare results obtained when using reads from different subsets of spots and/or when employing alternative genome or transcriptome references. Our comparative analyses demonstrate the impact of spot selection and the choice of genome/transcriptome references on the analysis results when employing the manufacturer's pipeline."

As a convolutional neural network model requires a large amount of image data for training, active learning (AL) has been developed to produce efficient learning with a small amount of training data. However, existing studies have not specifically considered the characteristics of pathological data collected from the workplace. For various reasons, noisy patches can be selected instead of clean patches during AL, thereby reducing its efficiency. This study proposes an effective AL method for cancer pathology that works robustly on noisy datasets. METHODS: Our proposed method to develop a robust AL approach for noisy histopathology datasets consists of the following three steps: 1) training a loss prediction module, 2) collecting predicted loss values, and 3) sampling data for labeling. This proposed method calculates the amount of information in unlabeled data as predicted loss values and removes noisy data based on predicted loss values to reduce the rate at which noisy data are selected from the unlabeled dataset. We identified a suitable threshold for optimizing the efficiency of AL through sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We compared the results obtained with the identified threshold with those of existing representative AL methods. In the final iteration, the proposed method achieved a performance of 91.7% on the noisy dataset and 92.4% on the clean dataset, resulting in a performance reduction of less than 1%. Concomitantly, the noise selection ratio averaged only 2.93% on each iteration. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed AL method showed robust performance on datasets containing noisy data by avoiding data selection in predictive loss intervals where noisy data are likely to be distributed. The proposed method contributes to medical image analysis by screening data and producing a robust and effective classification model tailored for cancer pathology image processing in the workplace."

However, compared to traditional image segmentation tasks, the large size of tissues in pathology images requires a larger receptive field. While methods based on dilated convolutions or attention mechanisms can enhance the receptive field, they cannot capture long-range feature dependencies. Directly applying self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies results in intolerable computational complexity. To address these challenges, we introduce a channel and spatial self-attention (CS) Module designed for efficiently capturing both channel and spatial long-range feature dependencies in pancreatic cancer pathological images. Specifically, the channel and spatial self-attention module consists of an adaptive channel self-attention module and a window-shift spatial self-attention module. The adaptive channel self-attention module adaptively pools features to a fixed size to capture long-range feature dependencies. While the window-shift spatial self-attention module captures spatial long-range dependencies in a window-based manner. Additionally, we propose a re-weighted cross-entropy loss to mitigate the impact of long-tail distribution on performance. Our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art on both our Pancreatic Cancer Pathology Image (PCPI) dataset and the GlaS challenge dataset. The mDice and mIoU have achieved 73.93% and 59.42% in our PCPI dataset."

Assessment and treatment of pathological scars are based on cutaneous manifestations. A two-photon microscope (TPM) with the potential for real-time non-invasive assessment may help determine the under-surface pathophysiological conditions in vivo . This study used a portable handheld TPM to image epidermal cells and dermal collagen structures in pathological scars and normal skin in vivo to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in scar patients. METHODS: Fifteen patients with pathological scars and three healthy controls were recruited. Imaging was performed using a portable handheld TPM. Five indexes were extracted from two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) perspectives, including collagen depth, dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) contour ratio, thickness, orientation, and occupation (proportion of collagen fibers in the field of view) of collagen. Two depth-dependent indexes were computed through the 3D second harmonic generation image and three morphology-related indexes from the 2D images. We assessed index differences between scar and normal skin and changes before and after treatment. RESULTS: Pathological scars and normal skin differed markedly regarding the epidermal morphological structure and the spectral characteristics of collagen fibers. Five indexes were employed to distinguish between normal skin and scar tissue. Statistically significant differences were found in average depth ( t = 9.917, P <0.001), thickness ( t = 4.037, P <0.001), occupation ( t = 2.169, P <0.050), orientation of collagen ( t = 3.669, P <0.001), and the DEJ contour ratio ( t = 5.105, P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of portable handheld TPM can distinguish collagen from skin tissues; thus, it is more suitable for scar imaging than reflectance confocal microscopy. Thus, a TPM may be an auxiliary tool for scar treatment selection and assessing treatment efficacy."

These include overfitting, exploding/vanishing gradients and other inefficiencies which are exacerbated by class imbalances and can affect the overall accuracy of a model. There is a need to develop semi-supervised models that can reduce the need for large, balanced, manually annotated datasets so that researchers can easily employ neural networks for experimental analysis. In this work, Iterative Pseudo Balancing (IPB) is introduced to classify stem cell microscopy images while performing on the fly dataset balancing using a student-teacher meta-pseudo-label framework. In addition, multi-scale patches of multi-label images are incorporated into the network training to provide previously inaccessible image features with both local and global information for effective and efficient learning. The combination of these inputs is shown to increase the classification accuracy of the proposed deep neural network by 3[Formula: see text] over baseline, which is determined to be statistically significant. This work represents a novel use of pseudo-labeling for data limited settings, which are common in biological image datasets, and highlights the importance of the exhaustive use of available image features for improving performance of semi-supervised networks.

Epub 2023 Dec 12.,Sun K,Med Biol Eng Comput,2024,2023/12/12,,,10.1007/s11517-023-02970-4,"Breast cancer pathological image segmentation (BCPIS) holds significant value in assisting physicians with quantifying tumor regions and providing treatment guidance. However, achieving fine-grained semantic segmentation remains a major challenge for this technology. The complex and diverse morphologies of breast cancer tissue structures result in high costs for manual annotation, thereby limiting the sample size and annotation quality of the dataset. These practical issues have a significant impact on the segmentation performance. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a semi-supervised learning model based on classification-guided segmentation. The model first utilizes a multi-scale convolutional network to extract rich semantic information and then employs a multi-expert cross-layer joint learning strategy, integrating a small number of labeled samples to iteratively provide the model with class-generated multi-cue pseudo-labels and real labels. Given the complexity of the breast cancer samples and the limited sample quantity, an innovative approach of augmenting additional unlabeled data was adopted to overcome this limitation. Experimental results demonstrate that, although the proposed model falls slightly behind supervised segmentation models, it still exhibits significant progress and innovation. The semi-supervised model in this study achieves outstanding performance, with an IoU (Intersection over Union) value of 71.53%. Compared to other semi-supervised methods, the model developed in this study demonstrates a performance advantage of approximately 3%. Furthermore, the research findings indicate a significant correlation between the classification and segmentation tasks in breast cancer pathological images, and the guidance of a multi-expert system can significantly enhance the fine-grained effects of semi-supervised semantic segmentation."

The fully-supervised nuclei detector requires a large number of nuclei annotations on high-resolution digital images, which is time-consuming and needs human annotators with professional knowledge. In recent years, weakly-supervised learning has attracted significant attention in reducing the labeling burden. However, detecting dense nuclei of complex crowded distribution and diverse appearances remains a challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a novel point-supervised dense nuclei detection framework that introduces position-based anchor optimization to complete morphology-based pseudo-label supervision. Specifically, we first generate cellular-level pseudo labels (CPL) for the detection head via a morphology-based mechanism, which can help to build a baseline point-supervised detection network. Then, considering the crowded distribution of the dense nuclei, we propose a mechanism called Position-based Anchor-quality Estimation (PAE), which utilizes the positional deviation between an anchor and its corresponding point label to suppress low-quality detections far from each nucleus. Finally, to better handle the diverse appearances of nuclei, an Adaptive Anchor Selector (AAS) operation is proposed to automatically select positive and negative anchors according to morphological and positional statistical characteristics of nuclei. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, MO and Lizard, using ResNet50 and PVTv2 as backbones. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior capacity compared with other state-of-the-art methods. In particularly, in dense nuclei scenarios, our method can achieve 95.1% performance of the fully-supervised approach. The code is available at https://github.com/NucleiDet/DenseNucleiDet."

CA is subdivided into four fields (CA1-CA3, plus CA3h/hilus of the dentate gyrus) with specific pyramidal cell morphology and connections. Work in non-human mammals has shown that hippocampal connectivity is precisely patterned both in the laminar and longitudinal axes. One of the main handicaps in the study of neuropathological semiology in the human hippocampus is the lack of clear laminar and longitudinal borders. The aim of this study was to explore a histochemical segmentation of the adult human hippocampus, integrating field (medio-lateral), laminar, and anteroposterior longitudinal patterning. We provide criteria for head-body-tail field and subfield parcellation of the human hippocampus based on immunodetection of Rabphilin3a (Rph3a), Purkinje-cell protein 4 (PCP4), Chromogranin A and Regulation of G protein signaling-14 (RGS-14). Notably, Rph3a and PCP4 allow to identify the border between CA3 and CA2, while Chromogranin A and RGS-14 give specific staining of CA2. We also provide novel histological data about the composition of human-specific regions of the anterior and posterior hippocampus. The data are given with stereotaxic coordinates along the longitudinal axis. This study provides novel insights for a detailed region-specific parcellation of the human hippocampus useful for human brain imaging and neuropathology."

The main limitation of Deep Learning (DL) to address this task is the scarcity of expert annotations. Crowdsourcing (CR) has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the individual (expert) annotation cost by distributing the labeling effort among a group of (non-expert) annotators. Extracting knowledge in this scenario is challenging, as it involves noisy annotations. Jointly learning the underlying (expert) segmentation and the annotators' expertise is currently a commonly used approach. Unfortunately, this approach is frequently carried out by learning a different neural network for each annotator, which scales poorly when the number of annotators grows. For this reason, this strategy cannot be easily applied to real-world CPATH segmentation. This paper proposes a new family of methods for CR segmentation of histopathological images. Our approach consists of two coupled networks: a segmentation network (for learning the expert segmentation) and an annotator network (for learning the annotators' expertise). We propose to estimate the annotators' behavior with only one network that receives the annotator ID as input, achieving scalability on the number of annotators. Our family is composed of three different models for the annotator network. Within this family, we propose a novel modeling of the annotator network in the CR segmentation literature, which considers the global features of the image. We validate our methods on a real-world dataset of Triple Negative Breast Cancer images labeled by several medical students. Our new CR modeling achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.7827, outperforming the well-known STAPLE (0.7039) and being competitive with the supervised method with expert labels (0.7723).

Specifically, we present a self-supervised pre-training model for hyperspectral images to serve downstream segmentation tasks. Secondly, we design a dual-stream U-Net-based network to extract features from different modal images. To promote information exchange between spatial information in RGB images and spectral information in hyperspectral images, we customize the cross-attention mechanism between the two networks. Furthermore, we use an intermediate agent in this mechanism to improve computational efficiency. Finally, we add a distillation loss to align predicted results for both branches, improving network generalization. Experimental results show that our CrossU-Net achieves accuracy and Dice of 96.53% and 91.62%, respectively, for GPL lesion segmentation, providing a promising spectral research approach for the localization and subsequent quantitative analysis of pathological features in early diagnosis."

Yet, the foundational principles guiding FARS lend themselves seamlessly to broader applications, including tumor and cancer diagnostics. FARS capitalizes on the untapped potential of transitioning from bounding box labels to richer semantic segmentation labels, enabling a more refined examination of microscopy slides. With the integration of adversarial training and the Color Domain Aware Fourier Domain Adaptation (F2DA), the model ensures consistent feature extraction across diverse microscopy configurations.

However, inherent bidimensionality limits histological procedures' effectiveness in identifying these changes. Our study applies a 3D virtual histology method based on X-ray phase-contrast microtomography (PhC mu CT), performed at a synchrotron facility, to investigate breast tissue samples including different types of lesions, namely intraductal papilloma, micropapillary intracystic carcinoma, and invasive lobular carcinoma. One-to-one comparisons of X-ray and histological images explore the clinical potential of 3D X-ray virtual histology. Results show that PhC mu CT technique provides high spatial resolution and soft tissue sensitivity, while being non-destructive, not requiring a dedicated sample processing and being compatible with conventional histology. PhC mu CT can enhance the visualization of morphological characteristics such as stromal tissue, fibrovascular core, terminal duct lobular unit, stromal/epithelium interface, basement membrane, and adipocytes. Despite not reaching the (sub) cellular level, the three-dimensionality of PhC mu CT images allows to depict in-depth alterations of the breast tissues, potentially revealing pathologically relevant details missed by a single histological section. Compared to serial sectioning, PhC mu CT allows the virtual investigation of the sample volume along any orientation, possibly guiding the pathologist in the choice of the most suitable cutting plane. Overall, PhC mu CT virtual histology holds great promise as a tool adding to conventional histology for improving efficiency, accessibility, and diagnostic accuracy of pathological evaluation."

Specifically, we combine different pooling methods to automatically select local regions of key growth patterns such as lung adenocarcinoma cells, enhancing the model's focus on local information. Additionally, we employ an interactive fusion approach to concentrate feature information within the same dimension and across dimensions, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments have shown that under the condition of maintaining equal computational expenses, the accuracy of DIEANet with ResNet34 as the backbone reaches 88.19%, with an AUC of 96.61%, MCC of 81.71%, and Kappa of 81.16%. Compared to seven other attention mechanisms, it achieves state-of-the-art objective metrics. Additionally, it aligns more closely with the visual attention of pathology experts under subjective visual assessment."

Human somatic cells may contain up to seven histone H1 variants, although their functional heterogeneity is not fully understood. Here, we have profiled the differential nuclear distribution of the somatic H1 repertoire in human cells through imaging techniques including super-resolution microscopy. H1 variants exhibit characteristic distribution patterns in both interphase and mitosis. H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are universally enriched at the nuclear periphery in all cell lines analyzed and co-localize with compacted DNA. H1.0 shows a less pronounced peripheral localization, with apparent variability among different cell lines. On the other hand, H1.4 and H1X are distributed throughout the nucleus, being H1X universally enriched in high-GC regions and abundant in the nucleoli. Interestingly, H1.4 and H1.0 show a more peripheral distribution in cell lines lacking H1.3 and H1.5. The differential distribution patterns of H1 suggest specific functionalities in organizing lamina-associated domains or nucleolar activity, which is further supported by a distinct response of H1X or phosphorylated H1.4 to the inhibition of ribosomal DNA transcription. Moreover, H1 variants depletion affects chromatin structure in a variant-specific manner. Concretely, H1.2 knock-down, either alone or combined, triggers a global chromatin decompaction. Overall, imaging has allowed us to distinguish H1 variants distribution beyond the segregation in two groups denoted by previous ChIP-Seq determinations. Our results support H1 variants heterogeneity and suggest that variant-specific functionality can be shared between different cell types."

Core to this approach is the need to generate reliable cell segmentations and classifications necessary for accurate quantitative analysis. Deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. However, current CNNs are prone to produce noisy cell segmentations and classifications, which is a significant barrier to constructing accurate single-cell lineages. To address this, we developed a novel algorithm called Single Cell Track (SC-Track), which employs a hierarchical probabilistic cache cascade model based on biological observations of cell division and movement dynamics. Our results show that SC-Track performs better than a panel of publicly available cell trackers on a diverse set of cell segmentation types. This cell-tracking performance was achieved without any parameter adjustments, making SC-Track an excellent generalized algorithm that can maintain robust cell-tracking performance in varying cell segmentation qualities, cell morphological appearances and imaging conditions. Furthermore, SC-Track is equipped with a cell class correction function to improve the accuracy of cell classifications in multiclass cell segmentation time series. These features together make SC-Track a robust cell-tracking algorithm that works well with noisy cell instance segmentation and classification predictions from CNNs to generate accurate single-cell lineages and classifications."

Prism structure plays a key role in the excellent mechanical performance of dental enamel during millions of chewing cycles without significant remodeling. Thus, quantitative understanding of prism architecture is of utmost importance for biomechanical materials design. To characterize enamel prism orientation quantitatively, a novel image processing method has been developed. Our method is based on scanning electron microscopy images of etched enamel surface and consists of an ellipse fitting procedure, which provides a numerical approximation of prism shape and orientation in the studied cross section. The obtained analytical data allow to construct color coded orientation maps, which provide quick and useful insight into the microstructure of enamel. Besides striking visualization, orientation maps allow to extract and plot the rich information on the azimuthal and inclination angles of the prisms as function of location. Numerical data on prism arrangement can be analyzed using statistical tools over large areas, which paves the way towards quantifying comparative investigation of prism arrangement either in dentistry research or evolution biology. The application of the method is demonstrated for a distal-mesial cross-section of sound human tooth enamel. HIGHLIGHTS: Scanning electron microscopy images of etched enamel surface are analyzed using ellipse fitting. Geometrical parameters of the fitted ellipses provide numerical data of thousands of prisms. Prism arrangement is visualized on color coded orientation maps and analyzed using statistical tools."

Epub 2024 Jan 10.,Zhang W,Cytometry A,2024,2023/12/19,,,10.1002/cyto.a.24819,"In biomedicine, the automatic processing of medical microscope images plays a key role in the subsequent analysis and diagnosis. Cell or nucleus segmentation is one of the most challenging tasks for microscope image processing. Due to the frequently occurred overlapping, few segmentation methods can achieve satisfactory segmentation accuracy yet. In this paper, we propose an approach to separate the overlapped cells or nuclei based on the outer Canny edges and morphological erosion. The threshold selection is first used to segment the foreground and background of cell or nucleus images. For each binary connected domain in the segmentation image, an intersection based edge selection method is proposed to choose the outer Canny edges of the overlapped cells or nuclei. The outer Canny edges are used to generate a binary cell or nucleus image that is then used to compute the cell or nucleus seeds by the proposed morphological erosion method. The nuclei of the Human U2OS cells, the mouse NIH3T3 cells and the synthetic cells are used for evaluating our proposed approach. The quantitative quantification accuracy is computed by the Dice score and 95.53% is achieved by the proposed approach. Both the quantitative and the qualitative comparisons show that the accuracy of the proposed approach is better than those of the area constrained morphological erosion (ACME) method, the iterative erosion (IE) method, the morphology and watershed (MW) method, the Generalized Laplacian of Gaussian filters (GLGF) method and ellipse fitting (EF) method in separating the cells or nuclei in three publicly available datasets."

These biases decrease the robustness of machine learning models exposed to out-of-domain data. To address this issue, we introduce a comprehensive histopathology image dataset named PathoLogy Images of Scanners and Mobile phones (PLISM). The dataset consisted of 46 human tissue types stained using 13 hematoxylin and eosin conditions and captured using 13 imaging devices. Precisely aligned image patches from different domains allowed for an accurate evaluation of color and texture properties in each domain. Variation in PLISM was assessed and found to be significantly diverse across various domains, particularly between whole-slide images and smartphones. Furthermore, we assessed the improvement in domain shift using a convolutional neural network pre-trained on PLISM. PLISM is a valuable resource that facilitates the precise evaluation of domain shifts in digital pathology and makes significant contributions towards the development of robust machine learning models that can effectively address challenges of domain shift in histological image analysis."

Image stitching involves two main steps: pairwise registration and global alignment. Most of the computational load and the accuracy of the stitching algorithm depend on the pairwise registration method. Therefore, choosing an efficient, accurate, robust, and fast pairwise registration method is crucial in the whole slide imaging technique. This paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of different pairwise registration techniques in terms of execution time and quality. These techniques included feature-based methods such as Harris, Shi-Thomasi, FAST, ORB, BRISK, SURF, SIFT, KAZE, MSER, and deep learning-based SuperPoint features. Additionally, region-based methods were analyzed, which were based on the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and the combination of phase correlation and NCC. Investigations have been conducted on microscopy images from different modalities such as bright-field, phase-contrast, and fluorescence. The feature-based methods were highly robust to uneven illumination in tiles. Moreover, some features were found to be more accurate and faster than region-based methods, with the SURF features identified as the most effective technique. This study provides valuable insights into the selection of the most efficient and accurate pairwise registration method for creating whole slide images, which is essential for the advancement of computational pathology and biology."

We address these challenges by representing spatial transcriptomics data as generalized functions encoding position and high-dimensional feature (gene, cell type) identity. We map onto low-dimensional atlas ontologies by modeling regions as homogeneous random fields with unknown transcriptomic feature distribution. We solve simultaneously for the minimizing geodesic diffeomorphism of coordinates through LDDMM and for these latent feature densities. We map tissue-scale mouse brain atlases to gene-based and cell-based transcriptomics data from MERFISH and BARseq technologies and to histopathology and cross-species atlases to illustrate integration of diverse molecular and cellular datasets into a single coordinate system as a means of comparison and further atlas construction."

This demand is particularly pronounced in fields such as computational pathology due to the diverse nature of the tissue. Cross-modal retrieval aims to identify a common latent space where different modalities, such as image-text pairs, exhibit close alignment. The primary challenge, however, often lies in the representation of tissue features. While language models can be trained relatively easily, visual models frequently struggle due to the scarcity of labeled data. To address this issue, the innovative concept of harmonization has been introduced, extending the learning scheme distillation without supervision, known as DINO. The harmonization of scale refines the DINO paradigm through a novel patching approach, overcoming the complexities posed by gigapixel whole slide images in digital pathology. Experiments conducted on diverse datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly enhances cross-modal retrieval in tissue imaging. Moreover, it exhibits vast potential for other fields that rely on gigapixel imaging."

Using high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM), digital volume data of eight samples of each skin region were produced. Virtual three-dimensional (3D) models of the dermally located SHCs were created, and their 3D tortuosity (tau) values were determined. Dermal SHCs were identified in all 24 finger samples and in 1 lip sample. Beneath a field of 2 x 2 mm2, an average of four were located in the nail bed, three in the dermis of the thumb pad, and one in the dermis of the nail fold corner. Only a single dermal SHC was found in one lip sample. No SHCs were observed in the dermis of the other samples. The tau values of the SHCs ranged from 1.11 to 10. Building on these values, a classification system was designed, which distinguishes four SHC classes. The dermal distribution of the SHCs of different classes was similar in all specimens."

This study aimed to achieve optimum visualization of the anatomical corridors of these fibers using Photoshop filters. METHODS: Four postmortem brain hemispheres were dissected in accordance with the method proposed by Klingler and Ludwig. Dissections were performed under a surgical microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) at 4x and 40x magnification. All dissections were documented at each stage using a professional digital camera (Canon EOS 600D) with a macro 100 mm lens (Canon), ring-flash attachment (Canon), and professional tripod (Manfrotto 808 C4). We aimed to improve the visual quality of the images by avoiding monotone using various the features and filters in Photoshop. RESULTS: SLF-2 originates from the angular gyrus (Brodmann area [BA] 39) in the right hemisphere and has been observed to project fibers from BA7 and BA19 and toward BA8, 9, 10, and 46. Further, these fibers traverse from the depths of BA40, 2, 3, 1, and 6 as they progress. SLF-2 also projects fibers from the supramarginal gyrus in the left hemisphere. SLF-3 lies between the supramarginal gyrus and the inferior frontal lobe in both the right and left hemispheres. CONCLUSIONS: The visual descriptions of the dissections were enriched after using Photoshop to avoid monotony. Increasing the visual quality with Photoshop features enable us to gain a better understanding of these pathways. Additionally, it facilitates the comprehension of the symptoms associated with pathology. We hope these results will further aid in reducing the occurrence of postoperative complications."

This task is challenging for algorithms and human experts alike, with deterioration of algorithmic performance under shifts in image representations. Considerable covariate shifts occur when assessment is performed on different tumor types, images are acquired using different digitization devices, or specimens are produced in different laboratories. This observation motivated the inception of the 2022 challenge on MItosis Domain Generalization (MIDOG 2022). The challenge provided annotated histologic tumor images from six different domains and evaluated the algorithmic approaches for mitotic figure detection provided by nine challenge participants on ten independent domains. Ground truth for mitotic figure detection was established in two ways: a three-expert majority vote and an independent, immunohistochemistry-assisted set of labels. This work represents an overview of the challenge tasks, the algorithmic strategies employed by the participants, and potential factors contributing to their success. With an F(1) score of 0.764 for the top-performing team, we summarize that domain generalization across various tumor domains is possible with today's deep learning-based recognition pipelines. However, we also found that domain characteristics not present in the training set (feline as new species, spindle cell shape as new morphology and a new scanner) led to small but significant decreases in performance. When assessed against the immunohistochemistry-assisted reference standard, all methods resulted in reduced recall scores, with only minor changes in the order of participants in the ranking."

Unfortunately, categorizing cells and delineating their boundaries for training deep networks is an expensive process that requires skilled biologists. This paper presents a novel self-supervised Dual-Loss Adaptive Masked Autoencoder (DAMA) for learning rich features from multiplexed immunofluorescence brain images. DAMA's objective function minimizes the conditional entropy in pixel-level reconstruction and feature-level regression. Unlike existing self-supervised learning methods based on a random image masking strategy, DAMA employs a novel adaptive mask sampling strategy to maximize mutual information and effectively learn brain cell data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to develop a self-supervised learning method for multiplexed immunofluorescence brain images. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that DAMA features enable superior cell detection, segmentation, and classification performance without requiring many annotations. In addition, to examine the generalizability of DAMA, we also experimented on TissueNet, a multiplexed imaging dataset comprised of two-channel fluorescence images from six distinct tissue types, captured using six different imaging platforms.

METHODS: We scanned 180 consecutive bone marrow needle aspirates smears using the ""Metafer4 VSlide"" whole slide imaging (WSI) digital scanning system. We evaluated the statistical comparability and the risk of bias of the microscopic readings with those performed on the screen on the digitized medullary images. RESULTS: The evaluation of cellularity on the screen was equivalent, with a higher frequency of ""normal"" than the analysis of digital preparations. The means and medians of the percentage values obtained on the different cell populations with the microscopic and digital reading were comparable as the main categories are concerned, with an average difference equal to 0 for the neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytic series, at -0.2% for the total myeloid cells, at 1.2% for the erythroid series, at -0.4% for the lymphocytes and at -0.4% for the blasts. Dysplastic features were consistently identified in 69/71 cell lineages. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that screen evaluation of digitized bone marrow needle aspirates provides quantitative and qualitative results comparable to traditional microscopic analysis of the corresponding slide smears. Digital images offer significant benefits in reducing the workload of experienced operators, reproducibility and sharing of observations, and image preservation. Even in routine diagnostic activities, their use does not alter the quality of the results obtained in evaluating bone marrow needle aspirates."

These irregular nuclei are significant for assessing tissue repair in immunotherapy, a process involving neovascularization and fibroblast proliferation. Proper segmentation of these nuclei is vital for evaluating immunotherapy's efficacy, as it provides insights into pathological features. However, the challenge lies in the pronounced curvature variations of these non-convex nuclei, making their segmentation more difficult than that of regular nuclei. In this work, we introduce an undefined task to segment nuclei with both regular and irregular morphology, namely multi-shape nuclei segmentation. We propose a proposal-based method to perform multi-shape nuclei segmentation. By leveraging the two-stage structure of the proposal-based method, a powerful refinement module with high computational costs can be selectively deployed only in local regions, improving segmentation accuracy without compromising computational efficiency. We introduce a novel self-attention module to refine features in proposals for the sake of effectiveness and efficiency in the second stage. The self-attention module improves segmentation performance by capturing long-range dependencies to assist in distinguishing the foreground from the background. In this process, similar features get high attention weights while dissimilar ones get low attention weights. In the first stage, we introduce a residual attention module and a semantic-aware module to accurately predict candidate proposals. The two modules capture more interpretable features and introduce additional supervision through semantic-aware loss. In addition, we construct a dataset with a proportion of non-convex nuclei compared with existing nuclei datasets, namely the multi-shape nuclei (MsN) dataset. Our MSNSegNet method demonstrates notable improvements across various metrics compared to the second-highest-scoring methods. For all nuclei, the Dice score improved by approximately 1.66 % , AJI by about 2.15 % , and Diceobj by roughly 0.65 % . For non-convex nuclei, which are crucial in clinical applications, our method's AJI improved significantly by approximately 3.86 % and Diceobj by around 2.54 % . These enhancements underscore the effectiveness of our approach on multi-shape nuclei segmentation, particularly in challenging scenarios involving irregularly shaped nuclei."

Epub 2024 Feb 27.,Yücel Z,Med Biol Eng Comput,2024,2024/02/27,,,10.1007/s11517-024-03045-8,"Early detection is critical for successfully diagnosing cancer, and timely analysis of diagnostic tests is increasingly important. In the context of neuroendocrine tumors, the Ki-67 proliferation index serves as a fundamental biomarker, aiding pathologists in grading and diagnosing these tumors based on histopathological images. The appropriate treatment plan for the patient is determined based on the tumor grade. An artificial intelligence-based method is proposed to aid pathologists in the automated calculation and grading of the Ki-67 proliferation index. The proposed system first performs preprocessing to enhance image quality. Then, segmentation process is performed using the U-Net architecture, which is a deep learning algorithm, to separate the nuclei from the background. The identified nuclei are then evaluated as Ki-67 positive or negative based on basic color space information and other features. The Ki-67 proliferation index is then calculated, and the neuroendocrine tumor is graded accordingly. The proposed system's performance was evaluated on a dataset obtained from the Department of Pathology at Meram Faculty of Medicine Hospital, Necmettin Erbakan University. The results of the pathologist and the proposed system were compared, and the proposed system was found to have an accuracy of 95% in tumor grading when compared to the pathologist's report."

Epub 2024 Mar 8.,Muro S,BJU Int,2024,2024/03/08,,,10.1111/bju.16307,"OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the male urethral muscular structure and its relationship with the anorectal canal muscles, as establishing an anatomical foundation for urethral function will contribute to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary incontinence. METHODS: Eight male cadavers were used. Using a multifaceted approach, we performed macroscopic anatomical examination, histological analysis of wide-range serial sectioning and immunostaining, and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from histological sections. In the macroscopic anatomical examination, pelvic halves were meticulously dissected in layers from the medial aspect. In the histological analysis, the tissue, including the urethra and anorectal canal, was serially sectioned in the horizontal plane. The muscular structures were reconstructed and visualised in 3D. RESULTS: The membranous portion of the urethra had three muscle layers: the longitudinal and circular muscles (smooth muscle) and the external urethral sphincter (skeletal muscle). The circular muscle was connected posteriorly to the longitudinal rectal muscle. The external urethral sphincter had a horseshoe shape, with its posterior ends continuing to the external anal sphincter, forming a 3D ring-like sphincter. CONCLUSION: This study revealed skeletal and smooth muscle connections between the male urethra and anorectal canal, enabling urethral compression and closure. These anatomical muscle connections suggest a functional linkage between them."

Epub 2024 Apr 24.,Chen X,Comput Biol Med,2024,2024/04/28,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108500,"Vaginitis is a common disease among women and has a high recurrence rate. The primary diagnosis method is fluorescence microscopic inspection, but manual inspection is inefficient and can lead to false detection or missed detection. Automatic cell identification and localization in microscopic images are necessary. For vaginitis diagnosis, clue cells and trichomonas are two important indicators and are difficult to be detected because of the different scales and image characteristics. This study proposes a Multi-Scale Perceptual YOLO (MSP-YOLO) with super-resolution reconstruction branch to meet the detection requirements of clue cells and trichomonas. Based on the scales and image characteristics of clue cells and trichomonas, we employed a super-resolution reconstruction branch to the detection network. This branch guides the detection branch to focus on subtle feature differences. Simultaneously, we proposed an attention-based feature fusion module that is injected with dilated convolutional group. This module makes the network pay attention to the non-centered features of the large target clue cells, which contributes to the enhancement of detection sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed detection network MSP-YOLO can improve sensitivity without compromising specificity. For clue cell and trichomoniasis detection, the proposed network achieved sensitivities of 0.706 and 0.910, respectively, which were 0.218 and 0.051 higher than those of the baseline model. In this study, the characteristics of the super-resolution reconstruction task are used to guide the network to effectively extract and process image features. The novel proposed network has an increased sensitivity, which makes it possible to detect vaginitis automatically."

Epub 2024 May 4.,Kumar A,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2024,2024/05/09,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108207,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer (LC) has a high fatality rate that continuously affects human lives all over the world. Early detection of LC prolongs human life and helps to prevent the disease. Histopathological inspection is a common method to diagnose LC. Visual inspection of histopathological diagnosis necessitates more inspection time, and the decision depends on the subjective perception of clinicians. Usually, machine learning techniques mostly depend on traditional feature extraction which is labor-intensive and may not be appropriate for enormous data. In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture is proposed for the more effective classification of lung tissue subtypes using histopathological images. METHODS: Authors have utilized the first-time nonlocal mean (NLM) filter to suppress the effect of noise from histopathological images. NLM filter efficiently eliminated noise while preserving the edges of images. Then, the obtained denoised images are given as input to the proposed multi-headed lung cancer classification convolutional neural network (ML3CNet). Furthermore, the model quantization technique is utilized to reduce the size of the proposed model for the storage of the data. Reduction in model size requires less memory and speeds up data processing. RESULTS: The effectiveness of the proposed model is compared with the other existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed ML3CNet achieved an average classification accuracy of 99.72%, sensitivity of 99.66%, precision of 99.64%, specificity of 99.84%, F-1 score of 0.9965, and area under the curve of 0.9978. The quantized accuracy of 98.92% is attained by the proposed model. To validate the applicability of the proposed ML3CNet, it has also been tested on the colon cancer dataset. CONCLUSION: The findings reveal that the proposed approach can be beneficial to automatically classify LC subtypes that might assist healthcare workers in making decisions more precisely. The proposed model can be implemented on the hardware using Raspberry Pi for practical realization."
38282291,Frequency shifts of free water signals from compact bone: Simulations and measurements using a UTE-FID sequence,"Fischer A, Martirosian P, Machann J, Fränkle B, Schick F.",Magn Reson Med. 2024 Jul;92(1):257-268. doi: 10.1002/mrm.30027. Epub 2024 Jan 28.,Fischer A,Magn Reson Med,2024,2024/01/29,,,10.1002/mrm.30027,PURPOSE: Free water in cortical bone is either contained in nearly cylindrical structures (mainly Haversian canals oriented parallel to the bone axis) or in more spherically shaped pores (lacunae). Those cavities have been reported to crucially influence bone quality and mechanical stability. Susceptibility differences between bone and water can lead to water frequency shifts dependent on the geometric characteristics. The purpose of this study is to calculate and measure the frequency distribution of the water signal in MRI in dependence of the microscopic bone geometry. METHODS: Finite element modeling and analytical approaches were performed to characterize the free water components of bone. The previously introduced UTE-FID technique providing spatially resolved FID-spectra was used to measure the frequency distribution pixel-wise for different orientations of the bone axis. RESULTS: The frequency difference between free water in spherical pores and in canals parallel to B(0) amounts up to approximately 100 Hz at 3T. Simulated resonance frequencies showed good agreement with the findings in UTE-FID spectra. The intensity ratio of the two signal components (parallel canals and spherical pores) was found to vary between periosteal and endosteal regions. CONCLUSION: Spatially resolved UTE-FID examinations allow the determination of the frequency distribution of signals from free water in cortical bone. This frequency distribution indicates the composition of the signal contributions from nearly spherical cavities and cylindrical canals which allows for further characterization of bone structure and status.

Epub 2024 Mar 3.,Faibis C,Microsc Res Tech,2024,2024/03/04,,,10.1002/jemt.24525,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer. It develops slowly as a polyp that can turn into a cancerous tumor. This study aimed to develop a decision-making algorithm of microscopic images using texture analysis that is orientation free, to be used for automated classification of normal and neoplastic (malignant or premalignant) colonic biopsies. Forty-nine colonic adenocarcinomas, 41 adenomas and a control group of adjacent normal colonic mucosa were included in the texture analysis. Radon transform followed by the Fast Fourier transform were applied to the images. Subsequently, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) transform was applied allowing the extraction of four textural variables (homogeneity, contrast, correlation, and entropy). For classification and prediction of the diagnosis, a statistical multivariate regression model and a neural network (NNET) model were used and compared. The statistical model provided a sensitivity of 71.3% and a specificity of 50% (Area under the ROC curve: 0.67) for classifying the neoplastic and the normal images, respectively. The NNET model was superior to the statistical model and produced a sensitivity of 97.9% and specificity of 88% (Area under the ROC curve: 0.92). To our knowledge, this is the first study that used a combination of Radon, FFT, and GLCM transformations in order to overcome the tissue orientation problem in texture analysis of microscopic images of colonic biopsies. The NNET classifier trained by the extracted textural features proved to be superior to the statistical classifier, thus predicting colonic neoplasia with high accuracy. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: We propose a novel decision-making algorithm of orientation invariant image texture analysis, fast and easily implemented for automated differentiation between benign and neoplastic epithelial tumors of the colon. This method can reduce the turnaround time allowing to prioritize the biopsies during their examination and diagnosis by the pathologist."
