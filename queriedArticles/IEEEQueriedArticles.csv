Investigation of diagnostic techniques for metal oxide surge arresters,"Gapless metal oxide surge arresters (MOSA) have been available in the market for many years since they were first introduced in the 1970's. The aim of this study is to investigate some reliable diagnostic techniques to assess the condition of a metal oxide surge arrester when subjected to severe lightning strikes in the field. A number of nondestructive and destructive diagnostic techniques for metal oxide surge arrester (MOSA) are discussed in this paper. The nondestructive techniques include the standard 1 mA reference voltage, lightning impulse discharge residual voltage and a number of modern diagnostics based on polarization methods: Return voltage and polarization/depolarization current measurements. In order to observe, analyze and correctly explain the degradation phenomena, a number of destructive techniques based on microstructure observation are also conducted. The techniques include optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectrometry. The single and multipulse currents of 8/20 mus wave shape were used to artificially degrade the MOSA. The before and after diagnostic results of the nondestructive and destructive techniques are presented and interpreted to understand the aging mechanism in MOSA. The importance of modern nondestructive electrical diagnostics based on polarization methods is validated by test results and is highlighted in detail in this paper. Finally the correlation of the results of different diagnostic techniques with each other and with the results of standard techniques is discussed",Surges;Arresters;Optical microscopy;Voltage;Lightning;Optical polarization;Degradation;Scanning electron microscopy;Measurement standards;Current measurement,ARTICLE,2005,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,10.1109/TDEI.2005.1394015
Micropatterned hydrogel surfaces for controlled cell adhesion,"Spatially resolved radiation from a scanning electron microscope can be used to create micro- and nanoscopic hydrogels from poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG] with an approach similar to the electron-beam patterning of polymeric photoresists. We show that the patterned features generated by electron-beam cross-linking swell when exposed to water. The extent of swelling depends on the incident electron dose. Because of the significance of PEG in biomaterials applications, we examined the adsorption of fibronectin and laminin onto the PEG microhydrogels using immunofluorescence optical microscopy. Undetectable levels of protein are observed for low dose patterns. The amount of adsorbed protein increases with the dose and reaches a maximum at the highest doses where swelling is not observed. As part of ongoing research on patterning surfaces to control neurite growth in the context of the inflammatory environment of a spinal cord injury, we are interested in how these gel surfaces interact with macrophages. We show that the number of adhered macrophages can be also controlled by the irradiation conditions. By spatially patterning combinations of low and high swelling gels, we show that macrophage adhesion can be confined to specific locations on the surface.",Adhesives;Optical microscopy;Proteins;Spatial resolution;Scanning electron microscopy;Polymers;Resists;Microhydro power;Immune system;Biomedical optical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,"Proceedings of the IEEE 31st Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference, 2005.",10.1109/NEBC.2005.1431899
Soft computing algorithms applied to the segmentation of nerve cell images,"Microscopic images of stained nerve cells are routinely analyzed during neuropathological research. Manual analysis relies heavily on operator knowledge, and therefore can be highly subjective. The process is also time consuming. This paper investigates the use of fuzzy C-means to automate the analysis of nerve cell images. Using fuzzy C-means clustering, nerve cells are detected in an image. The nerve cells are then classified into degrees of health based upon their physical characteristics. A fuzzy approach is taken in order to account for vagueness in the data. This ambiguity stems from both the nature of digital images and the nature of biological systems.",Image segmentation;Image analysis;Software systems;Clustering algorithms;Shape;Application software;Pattern recognition;Colored noise;Fuzzy systems;Iterative algorithms,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,"Sixth International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing and First ACIS International Workshop on Self-Assembling Wireless Network",10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.73
Continuous deposition of thermally co-evaporated YBCO/CeO/sub 2//Ni coated conductors,"By using a simple single-pass reel-to-reel system, we demonstrate a simple and robust in-situ route for the continuous deposition of 1-2 m long Coated Conductors (CC) consisting of 1 /spl mu/m thick superconducting YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7/ (YBCO) films deposited by thermal co-evaporation onto 100 nm thick CeO/sub 2/ buffered cube textured Ni tapes. The buffer layer was deposited by either e-beam or thermal evaporation using respectively ceria or metallic cerium. The structural and morphological properties of the samples were investigated by X-ray /spl thetav/-2/spl thetav/ Bragg-Brentano, and pole figure diffraction, Nomarsky optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis. The 123 composition was controlled during deposition by means of an atomic absorption system. The optimized buffer layer and YBCO layer are grown at 690/spl deg/C in respectively forming gas and oxygen partial pressures of 5/spl times/10/sup -5/ mbar. These conditions ensure the growth of dense and crack-free layers with good biaxial texture, as indicated by FWHM's values in the 5-7/spl deg/ range for both in- and out-of-plane orientations. Zero-resistance critical temperatures T/sub c/=86-87 K with transition widths /spl Delta/T/sub c/<3 K are reproducibly obtained. End-to-end critical current densities J/sub c/ at 77 K and self-field typically are in the 1.5-2.5 MA/cm/sup 2/ range, as measured by transport measurements. It is found that tape motion does not significantly affect these properties.",Yttrium barium copper oxide;Optical microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy;Conductive films;Superconducting films;Optical buffering;Buffer layers;Density measurement;Current measurement;Robustness;continuous deposition;thermal co-evaporation;YBCO,ARTICLE,2005,IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity,10.1109/TASC.2005.847685
Grain boundaries in multi-seeded melt-grown superconductors,"Future applications of high temperature superconductors require bulk materials of a complex shape. The multi-seeded-melt-growth process (MSMG) represents a promising technique for obtaining qualitatively well oriented bulk materials with different kinds of shape. In the MSMG process, several seeds are placed on a precursor pellet, from which the growth of the bulk starts. A certain problem of the MSMG process is that grain boundaries become inevitable when the growth fronts of two neighboring seeds collide. These grain boundaries are responsible for a reduction of the critical currents and pose a problem for high current applications. By polishing the sample step by step, the influence of the grain boundaries was investigated by scanning Hall probe measurements and by the magnetoscan technique. Additionally, optical microscopy and electron microscopy were employed to investigate the details of the microstructure.",Grain boundaries;Superconductivity;Optical microscopy;High temperature superconductors;Superconducting materials;Shape;Electron microscopy;Critical current;Hall effect devices;Superconducting magnets;Grain boundaries;Hall probe measurements;MSMG,ARTICLE,2005,IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity,10.1109/TASC.2005.848978
A computer-based system to analyze neuron images,"We present a system of analyzing microscopy neuron images and archiving image data and analyzed results. The system focuses on processing 3D neuron images and extracting features concerning dendrites and spines. To extract dendrite and spine features, we apply morphology analysis to identify dendrites at first. Based on detected dendrites, we use region-growing to detect spines, which are short protrusions attached to the dendrite. The system has been shown to help researchers to reduce time in analyzing neuron images.",Image analysis;Neurons;Data mining;Data analysis;Feature extraction;Optical microscopy;Image databases;Spatial databases;Pipelines;Image processing,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465563
Automated dynamic cellular analysis in high throughput drug screens,"To understand drug effects on cancer cells better, it is important to analyze cell nuclei dynamics from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy data. Existing methods, however, are rather limited in dealing with such time-lapse datasets while manual analysis is unreasonably time-consuming. We have therefore developed an automated system that can segment and track thousands of nuclei concurrently in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy data. Numerical nuclei features can be extracted based on our segmentation and tracking results. These features can be used for quantitative analysis of nuclei for high throughput drug screens.",Throughput;Drugs;Merging;Shape;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image analysis;Fluorescence;Rendering (computer graphics);Large-scale systems,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465564
Spectroscopic ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy studies of RF sputtered Cd/sub 1-x/Mn/sub x/Te films,"Automatic spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) with a 0.75 - 6.5 eV photon energy range was used together with atomic force microscopy to investigate surface optical and structural characteristics of as-deposited, annealed, and chloride treated Cd/sub 1-x/Mn/sub x/Te thin films. The E/sub 1/, E/sub 1/ + /spl Delta//sub 1/, and E/sub 2/ critical-point structures were clearly observed in the SE data for as-deposited samples. The variation of the pseudodielectric function for as-deposited samples was observed under different surface preparation and measurement conditions by in situ SE. The AFM images of the corresponding as-deposited samples revealed variations in surface morphology that were consistent with the SE results. For chloride treated samples, the pseudodielectric function was much different from that of as-deposited samples. This difference was due not only to oxidation of the surface, but also to a disruptive change of the bulk film under such annealing conditions.",Atomic force microscopy;Spectroscopy;Ellipsometry;Radio frequency;Surface morphology;Surface treatment;Atom optics;Optical microscopy;Optical films;Annealing,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,"Conference Record of the Thirty-first IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, 2005.",10.1109/PVSC.2005.1488174
Segmenting and tracking fluorescent cells in dynamic 3-D microscopy with coupled active surfaces,"Cell migrations and deformations play essential roles in biological processes, such as parasite invasion, immune response, embryonic development, and cancer. We describe a fully automatic segmentation and tracking method designed to enable quantitative analyses of cellular shape and motion from dynamic three-dimensional microscopy data. The method uses multiple active surfaces with or without edges, coupled by a penalty for overlaps, and a volume conservation constraint that improves outlining of cell/cell boundaries. Its main advantages are robustness to low signal-to-noise ratios and the ability to handle multiple cells that may touch, divide, enter, or leave the observation volume. We give quantitative validation results based on synthetic images and show two examples of applications to real biological data.",Fluorescence;Microscopy;Cells (biology);Biological processes;Immune system;Embryo;Cancer;Tracking;Design methodology;Shape;Active contours;cell biology;cell migration;deformable models;fluorescence;level sets;segmentation;three-dimensional (3-D);tracking,ARTICLE,2005,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2005.852790
Pro or Cons local vs. global imagery information for identifying cell migratory potential,"Cell migration is a complex process involving adhesion, anchorage and de-adhesion. It is also a reliable indicator of the outcome of cancer. Can a migratory cell behavior be reliably associated to a cell morphology? In the favourable case, it could become a visual indicator when coupled with image analyzis. In this work, microscopy images is much use to characterize the morphology of cells placed in various environments. Features were processed and cells were classified taking into account the biological expertise. Linking these results to experimental parameters and in vitro data, we proposed to evaluate the cell migratory potential. The results give the expert new insights into the most useful features and show the feasability of an automated inspection system.

Annealing Effect on the Formation of In(Ga)As Quantum Rings From InAs Quantum Dots,"The correlation between the In(Ga)As quantum rings (QRs) and their precursors InAs quantum dots (QDs) are studied by changing the annealing time after the deposition of a thin InAs layer on GaAs. The atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence (PL) are used to characterize the morphologies and electronic states of QDs and QRs. The longer annealing time tends to enlarge the QD size to high aspect ratio, group InAs islands into several different sizes, and red-shift the PL peak. The resultant QRs show the ridge-confined rings and the PL peaks of QRs blue-shift with increasing QD aspect ratio. It demonstrates an important way to tailor the electronics states of QRs.",Quantum dots;Annealing;Gallium arsenide;Atomic force microscopy;Molecular beam epitaxial growth;Optical microscopy;Atom optics;Temperature;Atomic layer deposition;Photoluminescence;Adatom migration;annealing time;elastic relaxation;quantum dots (QDs);quantum rings (QRs),ARTICLE,2008,IEEE Photonics Technology Letters,10.1109/LPT.2007.912481
"Rapid, localized synthesis of titanium-based nanoswords on MEMS","Herein, we report the discovery of a uniquely-shaped, titanium-based nanostructure called a ""nanosword,"" utilizing MEMS as the platform and using a rapid and localized induction heating system. The simple synthesis technique yields high-quality nanostructures with a rare shape that is broad and flat, tapering to a sharp tip with a curvature as low as 2 nm. Sans catalyst and self-sourced from an evaporated layer of titanium, they are synthesized in only 2-5 minutes by the selective heating of ring-shaped microstructures. Growth rates were observed to be 1- 2 mum/min and increases in both the nanosword quality and density were observed by increasing the synthesis temperature and source material volume, respectively. The resistivity averaged 0.192Omega-cm. Such high-quality, sharp-tipped nanostructures could be used in applications like nanoswitches, nanocantilevers, nanoprobes, or plasmonic applications such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and apertureless near-field scanning optical microscopy.",Micromechanical devices;Optical microscopy;Shape;Titanium;Heating;Microstructure;Temperature;Nanostructured materials;Optical materials;Conductivity,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 IEEE 21st International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems,10.1109/MEMSYS.2008.4443751
Reconstruction of Cellular Biological Structures from Optical Microscopy Data,"Developments in optical microscopy imaging have generated large high-resolution data sets that have spurred medical researchers to conduct investigations into mechanisms of disease, including cancer at cellular and subcellular levels. The work reported here demonstrates that a suitable methodology can be conceived that isolates modality-dependent effects from the larger segmentation task and that 3D reconstructions can be cognizant of shapes as evident in the available 2D planar images. In the current realization, a method based on active geodesic contours is first deployed to counter the ambiguity that exists in separating overlapping cells on the image plane. Later, another segmentation effort based on a variant of Voronoi tessellations improves the delineation of the cell boundaries using a Bayesian formulation. In the next stage, the cells are interpolated across the third dimension thereby mitigating the poor structural correlation that exists in that dimension. We deploy our methods on three separate data sets obtained from light, confocal, and phase-contrast microscopy and validate the results appropriately.",Optical microscopy;Biomedical optical imaging;Image reconstruction;Image segmentation;High-resolution imaging;Optical imaging;Biomedical imaging;Diseases;Cancer;Shape;Segmentation;Region growing;partitioning;Size and shape;Image Representation;Image Processing and Computer Vision;Image-based rendering;Segmentation;Region growing;partitioning;Size and shape;Image Representation;Image Processing and Computer Vision;Image-based rendering,ARTICLE,2008,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,10.1109/TVCG.2008.30

After briefly describing the laser machining system and principle of data processing, some objects are processed by CO2 laser (75W).

Titanium-based nanoswords: Synthesis and characterization,"In this work, we report the discovery of a novel, titanium-based nanostructure, a “nanosword,” that may be quickly and easily synthesized in bulk using an induction heating system. The nanoswords are high-quality, single-crystalline structures that are synthesized without catalysts. The self-sourcing, vapor-solid synthesis technique presented is quick, with synthesis occurring in as low as five minutes, and simple, necessitating only a thin-film of evaporated titanium. Using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, the observed thicknesses of the nanoswords were 200–700nm, widths were 20–60nm, and lengths were up to 5μm. The ends of the nanoswords taper at an angle of 78–82° to a sharp tip with radius of curvature as low as 2nm at an angle of 110– 114°. Strong peaks of titanium and oxygen were observed in the energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The reaction temperature was observed to influence the nanosword structure, with the best synthesis occurring at approximately 890°C. Three-point bend tests were performed using an atomic force microscope, and the average modulus of elasticity was measured to be 177GPa. The nanosword structures, with their unique shape, repeatable crystallinity, and simple synthesis technique may be used as field emitters, nanobioprobes, nanoswitches, or for plasmonic applications, such as apertureless near-field scanning optical microscopy tips or localized surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.",Titanium;Scanning electron microscopy;Transmission electron microscopy;Spectroscopy;Nanostructures;Atomic measurements;Atomic force microscopy;Force measurement;Optical microscopy;Transistors;Induction Heating;Metal Oxides;Nanoswords;Rapid Synthesis;Titania;Titanium-Based,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 3rd IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems,10.1109/NEMS.2008.4484491
Apoptosis-Inducing Effect of Caspase-3 Over-Expressed on Gastric Cancer Cell Line SGC7901,"To investigate the apoptosis-inducing effect of Caspases-3 expressed by constructed eukaryotic vector on gastric cancer cell line SGC7901.PCR was employed to amplify the sequences of both small and large subunits of Caspases-3. Its products were separately cloned into the Sma I site of pBluescript KS+ to generate both plasmids pBS/SS and pBS/LS. The small subunit fragment was excised from plasmid pBS/SS with BamH I and then inserted into the BamH I site of plasmid pBS/LS preceding that of the large subunit to yield plasmid pBS/Rev-Caspase-3. Rev-Caspase-3 cDNA was excised with Kpn I+Xba I and then subcloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (+) to construct Rev-Caspase-3 eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA/Rev-Caspase-3, which was used to transiently transfect SGC7901 cell line. Cell count, MTT assay and electron microscopy were used to confirm the antiproliferation and apoptosis-inducing effect of Rev-Caspase-3 expression on gastric cancer cells.Plasmid pBS/Rev-Caspase-3 and eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA/Rev-Caspase-3 were successfully constructed. SGC7901 cells were transiently transfected by either pcDNA/Rev-Caspase-3 or pcDNA3.1 (+) for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h respectively. Cell growth was measured by cell count and MTT assay. In cell count assay, the cell numbers were 1.8times106, 1.55times106, 2.0times106, and 3.1times106 in the experimental group and 2.5times106, 3.1times106, 4.0times106, and 5.7times106 in the control group at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h respectively. The growth of SGC7901 cells was suppressed by Rev-Caspase-3 in a time-dependent manner (P<0.05). The results of MTT assay were similar to that of cell count (P<0.05). The characteristics of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, crescent formation and margination were seen and more obvious with time in the given-experimental period in the experimental group, but not easily observed in the control group.The expression of Rev-Caspase-3 by the apoptosis of gastric cancer cell line SGC7901, which may exhibit a potential way in gastric cancer gene therapy.",Cancer;Oncological surgery;Hospitals;Application specific processors;Cardiology;Electron microscopy;Gene therapy;Amino acids;Biochemistry;Signal processing,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 2nd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/ICBBE.2008.106
Segmentation of Microscopic Images for Counting Leukocytes,"Counting of leukocytes in peripheral blood is commonly used in basic clinical diagnosis. The reliable approach to count leukocytes depends on morphological assessment of cellular materials under a light microscopy. Microscopic evaluation by medical technologists is a time-consuming and stuffy job. It is of interest to apply computer-aided analysis with image processing and pattern recognition, instead of human to count leukocytes. In this paper, a novel segmentation method is developed to count leukocytes by incorporating textural information. The proposed method integrates a non-decimated (or called shift invariant) complex wavelet transform into watershed segmentation, and uses information obtained by adaptive threshold segmentation to refine the result of watershed segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain satisfactory results in comparison with the judgments of medical technologists.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;White blood cells;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Clinical diagnosis;Materials reliability;Biological materials;Computer aided analysis;Image processing,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 2nd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/ICBBE.2008.985
Automated gland and nuclei segmentation for grading of prostate and breast cancer histopathology,"Automated detection and segmentation of nuclear and glandular structures is critical for classification and grading of prostate and breast cancer histopathology. In this paper, we present a methodology for automated detection and segmentation of structures of interest in digitized histopathology images. The scheme integrates image information from across three different scales: (1) low- level information based on pixel values, (2) high-level information based on relationships between pixels for object detection, and (3) domain-specific information based on relationships between histological structures. Low-level information is utilized by a Bayesian classifier to generate a likelihood that each pixel belongs to an object of interest. High-level information is extracted in two ways: (i) by a level-set algorithm, where a contour is evolved in the likelihood scenes generated by the Bayesian classifier to identify object boundaries, and (ii) by a template matching algorithm, where shape models are used to identify glands and nuclei from the low-level likelihood scenes. Structural constraints are imposed via domain- specific knowledge in order to verify whether the detected objects do indeed belong to structures of interest. In this paper we demonstrate the utility of our glandular and nuclear segmentation algorithm in accurate extraction of various morphological and nuclear features for automated grading of (a) prostate cancer, (b) breast cancer, and (c) distinguishing between cancerous and benign breast histology specimens. The efficacy of our segmentation algorithm is evaluated by comparing breast and prostate cancer grading and benign vs. cancer discrimination accuracies with corresponding accuracies obtained via manual detection and segmentation of glands and nuclei.",Glands;Breast cancer;Image segmentation;Cancer detection;Pixel;Object detection;Bayesian methods;Layout;Prostate cancer;Data mining;Prostate cancer;Breast cancer;Segmentation;Detection;Grading,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4540988
Color and texture based segmentation of molecular pathology images usING HSOMS,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, excluding skin cancer. It is diagnosed by histopathology interpretation of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections. Gland and nuclei distributions vary with the disease grade, and the morphological features vary with the advance of cancer. A tissue microarray with known disease stages can be used to enable efficient pathology slide image analysis. We focus on an intuitive approach for segmenting such images, using the Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (HSOM). Our approach introduces the use of unsupervised clustering using both color and texture features, and the use of unsupervised color merging outside of the HSOM framework. The HSOM was applied to segment 109 tissues composed of four tissue clusters: glands, epithelia, stroma, and nuclei. These segmentations were compared with the results of an EM Gaussian clustering algorithm. The proposed method confirms that the self-learning ability and adaptability of the HSOM, coupled with the information fusion mechanism of the hierarchical network, leads to superior segmentation results for tissue images.",Image segmentation;Pathology;Glands;Diseases;Prostate cancer;Skin cancer;Biological tissues;Image color analysis;Image texture analysis;Merging;Molecular pathology;Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H&E);Hierarchical selforganizing maps (HSOM);Color and texture segmentation;Feature extraction;Region merging;prostate cancer;Tissue microarray (TMA);Gleason score;Tumor staging;k-means clustering,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4540990
Multi-modal imaging of histological tissue sections,"Two common imaging modalities for histological sections are brightfield and fluorescence microscopy imaging. Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) based brightfield microscopy has been the traditional imaging technique for imaging morphology, while an epi-fluorescent microscope is used for immunofluorescent staining of specific proteins or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for genetic based analysis of DNA. Simultaneous imaging of both microscopy modalities has been difficult due to optical and chemical effects of the H&E dyes. We present a novel sequential imaging and registration technique that enables brightfield and fluorescent imaging on the same tissue section, hence combining the traditional anatomic pathology with the newly emerging field of molecular pathology. First the tissue is labeled with fluorescent biomarkers, and imaged through a fluorescence microscope, and then the tissue is re-labeled with H&E dyes, and imaged again with traditional brightfield. Our robust registration algorithms achieve 99.8% registration success rate on tissue micro array (TMA) sections.",Optical imaging;Fluorescence;Optical microscopy;Pathology;Morphology;Immune system;Proteins;Marine animals;Genetics;Image analysis;Image Registration;Brightfield Microscopy;Fluorescent Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4540989
Automated localization and quantification of protein multiplexes via multispectral fluorescence imaging,"We present a new system for automated localization and quantification of the expression of protein biomarkers in immunofluorescence (IF) microscopic images. The system includes a novel method for discriminating the biomarker signal from background, where signal may be the expression of any of the many biomarkers or counterstains used in IF. The method is based on supervised learning and represents the biomarker intensity threshold as a function of image background characteristics. The utility of the proposed system is demonstrated in predicting prostate cancer recurrence in patients undergoing prostatectomy. Specifically, features representing androgen receptor (AR) expression are shown to be statistically significantly associated with poor outcome in univariate analysis.

Unsupervised segmentation of cell nuclei using geometric models,Fluorescent microscopy of biological samples allows non-invasive screening of specific molecular events in-situ. This approach is useful for investigating intricate signalling pathways and in the drug discovery process. The large volumes of data involved in image analysis are a limiting factor. As manual image interpretation relies on expensive manpower automated analysis is a far more appropriate solution. In this paper we discuss our approach to achieve reliable automated segmentation of individual cell nuclei from wide field images taken of prostate cancer cells. We present a novel analysis routine to accurately identify cell nuclei based upon intensity clustering and morphological validation using a data derived geometric model. This approach is shown to consistently outperform the standard analysis technique using real data.,Solid modeling;Image analysis;Microscopy;Fluorescence;Cells (biology);Biological system modeling;Drugs;Image segmentation;Prostate cancer;Biological systems;Model-based segmentation;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Screening,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541099
Scoring histological sections through immunohistochemistry,"Immunohistochemical staining of biological samples provides a rapid protocol for visualizing various complexes and organelles. However, this method of sample staining is seldom used for direct quantitative analysis due to variations in sample fixations, ambiguities introduced by color composition, and the limited dynamic range of imaging in struments. We demonstrate that, through the decomposition of color signals, staining can be scored on a cell-by-cell basis. We applied our method to fibroblasts grown from histologically normal breast tissue biopsies obtained from two populations. Nuclear regions are initially segmented by a cascade of filters and geometric constraints. Subsequently, the strength of staining is quantified by a color decomposition model that is optimized by graph cut algorithm. By including color decomposition in the process, nuclear segmentation can be validated (corrected) for subsequent geometric representation. Finally, signal complexes are associated with each nuclear region following region-based Voronoi tessellation.",Immune system;Image color analysis;Protocols;Visualization;Image analysis;Dynamic range;Instruments;Fibroblasts;Breast tissue;Breast biopsy;Image Segmentation;Color Processing,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541003
Automatic cell segmentation from confocal microscopy images of the Arabidopsis root,"In vivo observation and tracking of cell division in the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem, by time-lapse confocal microscopy, is central to biology research. The research herein described is based on large amount of image data, which must be analyzed to determine the location and state of cells. The possibility of automating the process of cell detection/marking is an important step to provide research tools to the biologists in order to ease the search for a special event as cell division. This paper discusses an automatic cell segmentation method, which selects the best cell candidates from a starting watershed based image segmentation. The selection of individual cells is obtained using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, based on the shape and edge strength of the cells’ contour. The resulting segmentation is largely pruned of badly segmented cells, which can reduce the false positive detection of cell division.

Derived from deformable registration techniques, it does not solely rely on information present in the image, but uses a-priori information in terms of reference segmentations. The experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art feature based classifiers demonstrates the high performance in segmentation accuracy and the effectiveness of this approach. This serves as basis for processing high-resolution serial section datasets comprising several thousand images towards three-dimensional atlases of plant organs.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image reconstruction;Robustness;Biological system modeling;Rendering (computer graphics);Biological materials;Pixel;Deformable models;Genetics;Image segmentation;Image registration;Modeling;Biomedical microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541005
Automated grading of breast cancer histopathology using spectral clustering with textural and architectural image features,"In this paper we present a novel image analysis methodology for automatically distinguishing low and high grades of breast cancer from digitized histopathology. A set of over 3,400 image features, including textural and nuclear architecture based features, are extracted from a database of 48 breast biopsy tissue studies (30 cancerous and 18 benign images). Spectral clustering is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used (1) to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous images, and (2) to distinguish between images containing low and high grades of cancer. Classification is repeated using different subsets of features to compare their performance. The system achieves a 95.8% accuracy in distinguishing cancer from non-cancer using texture-based characteristics (Gabor filter features), and 93.3% accuracy in distinguishing high from low grades of cancer using architectural features. In addition, we investigate the underlying manifold structure on which the different grades of breast cancer lie as revealed through spectral clustering. The manifold shows a smooth spatial transition from low to high grade breast cancer.",Breast cancer;Breast tissue;Image texture analysis;Breast biopsy;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Gabor filters;Mammography;Diseases;Data visualization;Histopathology;Breast cancer;Image analysis;Automated grading,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541041
Detection of the dermis/epidermis boundary in reflectance confocal images using multi-scale classifier with adaptive texture features,"Reflectance confocal microscopy is an emerging modality for dermatology applications, especially in-situ and bedside detection of skin cancers. Work to date has concentrated on hardware development and validation by clinicians in comparison with standard histological staining. As this technology gains acceptance, the development of automated processing methods becomes more important. We concentrate here on detection of the dominant internal feature of the skin, the epidermis/dermis boundary, a complex corrugated 3-dimensional layer marked by optically subtle changes and features. We adopt a machine learning approach to this segmentation problem, using a hierarchical multi-scale classifier with sophisticated on-line feature selection, to minimize the required expert labeling and maximize the range of potential features in the face of high inter- and intra-subject variability and low optical contrast.

Morphological-based adaptive segmentation and quantification of cell assays in high content screening,"In fluorescence-labelled cell assays for high content screening applications, image processing software is necessary to have automatic algorithms for segmenting the cells individually and for quantifying their intensities, size/shape parameters, etc. Mathematical morphology is a non-linear image processing technique which is proven to be a very powerful tool in biomedical microscopy image analysis. This paper presents a morphological methodology based on connected filters, watershed transformation and granulometries for segmenting cells of different size, contrast, etc. In particular, the performance of the algorithms is illustrated with cell images from a toxicity assay in three-labels (Hoechst, EGFP, Phalloi'din) on nanodrops cell-on-chip format.",Image segmentation;Image processing;Fluorescence;Application software;Software algorithms;Shape;Morphology;Microscopy;Image analysis;Filters;quantitative cytology;mathematical morphology;watershed segmentation;multi-scale gradient;granulometry,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541007

Automated evaluation of HER-2/neu immunohistochemical expression in breast cancer using digital microscopy,"HER-2/neu (HER2) has been shown to be a valuable biomarker for breast cancer. However, inter-observer variability has been reported in the evaluation of HER2 with immunohistochemistry. It has been suggested that automated computer-based evaluation can provide a consistent and objective measure of HER2 expression. In this manuscript, we present an automated method for the quantitative assessment of HER2 using digital microscopy. The method employs imaging algorithms on whole slide images of tissue specimens for the extraction of two features describing HER2 membrane staining, namely membrane staining completeness and membrane staining intensity. A classifier was trained to merge the extracted features into an overall slide assessment score. Preliminary results showed good agreement with the provided truth. The developed automated method has the potential to be used as a computer aid for the immunohistochemical evaluation of HER2 expression with the objective of increasing observer reproducibility.",Breast cancer;Microscopy;Biomembranes;Immune system;Biomarkers;Medical treatment;Biomedical imaging;Clustering algorithms;Cells (biology);Feature extraction;microscopy imaging;immunohistochemistry;biomarker imaging;HER2/neu;computer aided analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541119
Microstructure preserving synthesis of biomedical images,"We present an approach for synthesizing biological tissue textures from existing tissue samples. At microscopic resolution, tissues are characterized by a spatial arrangement of nuclei, cytoplasm, red-blood cells (RBCs) and adipose components etc. We employ 2-point correlation functions (2-pcfs) to encode the geometrical aspects of component arrangements in the synthesis process. The 2-pcfs belong to a class of neighborhood density estimators and were recently introduced in microscopic image analysis. We provide examples of their application toward synthesis of histology-based tissue textures. We show that our methods retain properties such as component volume fractions, sizes and density in comparison to standard approaches.

A quantification framework for post-lesion neo-vascularization in retinal angiography,"We describe an image processing framework designed to detect and quantify the genesis of microscopic choroidal blood vessels. We used fluorescein angiography to monitor the dynamic of neo-vascularization of the retina after inducing lesions with a calibrated laser pulse. The angiogenesis can be revealed by an increase in the overall fluorescence level and/or diffusion size of the lesion. The proposed framework allows measuring both features from mis-aligned angiograms acquired with different gains and contrasts. It consists in aligning all the images, homogenizing their intensity characteristics and segmenting the lesions. In particular, we implemented a level set segmentation algorithm to delineate the diffusion area. We show that our framework allows detecting neo-vascularization when one of these features changes by less than 10%.",Retina;Angiography;Lesions;Image segmentation;Image processing;Process design;Microscopy;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging;Monitoring;Angiography;detection;registration;segmentation;level sets,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541282
Microassembly Fabrication of Tissue Engineering Scaffolds With Customized Design,"This paper presents a novel technique to fabricate scaffold/cell constructs for tissue engineering by robotic assembly of microscopic building blocks (of volume 0.50.50.2 and 60 thickness). In this way, it becomes possible to build scaffolds with freedom in the design of architecture, surface morphology, and chemistry. Biocompatible microparts with complex 3-D shapes were first designed and mass produced using MEMS techniques. Semi-automatic assembly was then realized using a robotic workstation with four degrees of freedom integrating a dedicated microgripper and two optical microscopes. Coarse movement of the gripper is determined by pattern matching in the microscopes images, while the operator controls fine positioning and accurate insertion of the microparts. Successful microassembly was demonstrated using SU-8 and acrylic resin microparts. Taking advantage of parts distortion and adhesion forces, which dominate at micro-level, the parts cleave together after assembly. In contrast to many current scaffold fabrication techniques, no heat, pressure, electrical effect, or toxic chemical reaction is involved, a critical condition for creating scaffolds with biological agents.",Microassembly;Fabrication;Tissue engineering;Robotic assembly;Grippers;Optical distortion;Optical microscopy;Surface morphology;Chemistry;Shape;Microassembly;microrobotics;scaffold;tissue engineering (TE),ARTICLE,2008,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,10.1109/TASE.2008.917011
Identification and Classification of Oral Cancer Using Machine Learning Techniques,"In recent time, oral cancer is one of the major health issues in the world [1] and it is most pervasive in the middle- and low-income country. Early detection process of this disease is much essential for beginning the treatment procedure for oral cancers. Convolutional Neural Network” (CNN) model is the primary process that assist to detect the cancer through datasets such as Common object in context, visual objects classed. Accordingly, CNN helps to build a framework for detecting the object. it also uses for the classification of the images. This disease detection process can be prevented by early treatment and can save many lives and as the symptoms are mild it is tough to differentiate from other minor diseases. A better screening process and advanced detection can cure cancer and decrease the rate of cancer. This particular study shed lights on the entire classification and identification process of oral cancer. There are two kinds of method such as automated classification and automated detection process of oral lesion that are based on the deep learning-based detection frame work and deep learning-based classification frame work. This study aims for the recognition of different types of oral cancers, especially buccal mucosa cancer (cancer in the inner cheek). Machine learning algorithms and deep learning [10] processes can help in the accurate detection of oral cancers as well as buccal mucosa cancer. There are several elements need to be properly implemented for the success of the machine learning process. In this study CNN model and VGG-16 used for the identification and detection process. The data used for the process often accommodates many unfavorable factors, such as noise, blurry pictures or angle of click, that are supposed to be drawn out before the processing. Histopathological and normal camera images are used in the screening process, and data preprocessing before the screening process should be done. On the other hand, feature extraction, data cleaning, data normalization, data transformation and selection. This processed data is used as the final data set and enhances the screening process. This study aims for accurate data, so the “Convolutional Neural Network” (CNN) model, the method of machine learning [1] and the deep learning approach is used in this study. Biopsy images, histopathological images and camera images for cancerous and non-cancerous lesions are used separately in the model for better results. This model provided the most accurate results with the help of a transfer learning approach with hyperparameter tuning. A sum of 164 histopathological and camera images were used for the model. From this study it has been seen that the model provides accurate and best outcomes from datasets.

Attention-based Mask R-CNN for Microvascular Segmentation,"The normal functioning of human organs and tissues depends on the spatial organization, specialization, and interaction between cells. With a total of 37 trillion cells in the human body, determining their functions and relationships is highly challenging. The Vascular Coordinate Common Framework (VCCF) is widely used for cell mapping, but it is limited by a lack of knowledge about the microvascular system. Therefore, we propose a novel framework called Attention-based Mask R-CNN for Microvascular Segmentation to achieve automated segmentation of microvascular arrangements. In terms of structure, our model replaces the original fully connected layers with the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) as the segmentation head network and integrates feature maps from different levels. To enhance performance, we introduce RoI (Region of Interest) feature alignment, employing techniques such as bilinear interpolation to accurately align features within the RoI region. Furthermore, to better focus on the regions of interest, we introduce an attention mechanism specifically designed for Human Vasculature, which improves the segmentation accuracy of critical areas. We train our model using 2D PAS-stained histological images of healthy human kidney tissue sections. Experimental results demonstrate the superior segmentation outcomes of our approach for microvascular structures, including capillaries, arterioles, and venules.",Image segmentation;Interpolation;Head;Organizations;Biological systems;Kidney;Medical diagnostic imaging;Instance Segmentation;Medical Imaging;Mask R-CNN;Attention,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"2023 7th International Conference on Electrical, Mechanical and Computer Engineering (ICEMCE)",10.1109/ICEMCE60359.2023.10490963
Heterogeneous Laplace Distribution Noise Background Modeling for Sperm Detection in Microscopic Images,"Semen quality assessment is a very important tool for the timely detection and treatment of infertility disorders. Many artificial intelligence methods for sperm image analysis have emerged in recent years. Sperm detection in sperm microscopy is the first step in semen quality assessment. However, the acquisition of sperm electron microscopy images can produce a variety of different background lighting situations. The performance of established methods is susceptible to changes in background illumination. Therefore, a sperm detection method with heterogeneous Laplacian distribution noise background modeling (HLDNBM) is proposed. In this paper the method uses background illumination surface fitting to eliminate the effect of illumination in a single sperm image, and realizes the segmentation of sperm head and sperm tail with different grayscale by upper and lower segmentation threshold surfaces to achieve complete sperm image segmentation and multi-target detection in a single image. This method effectively avoids the degradation of target detection performance caused by sudden changes in illumination in other background modeling methods. Moreover, this method shows strong adaptability for images with different lighting backgrounds, and is friendly to small datasets as well. The experimental results show that the accuracy and sensitivity of the algorithm for sperm detection in images with different grayscale characteristics are very promising, with high universality and robustness.",Image segmentation;Head;Noise;Fitting;Lighting;Tail;Gray-scale;Sperm detection;Heterogeneous Laplace background modeling;Multi-target detection;Background illumination surface,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 9th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),10.1109/ICCC59590.2023.10507353

The trapping of a red blood cell is realized by a fiber-optic tweezers system. The optical force on a red blood cell increases with the viscosity coefficient of the surrounding medium. On this basis, the viscosity coefficients of the glycerol solutions with different concentrations are measured successfully. The sample volume of the blood solutions is less than 1 μL.

Morphology-Based Machine Learning Mechanism for Unsupervised Framework Prediction Using Statistical Segmentation on Blood Cancer,"White blood cells are a component of the immune system that defends the body from pathogens. The most typical blood malignancy that can be fatal is leukaemia. It happens because the bone marrow produces a lot of immature WBCs, which kill healthy cells. It is essential to detect the morphology of the cells that are immature because it can bring down the number of people requiring treatment. Techniques based on Deep-learning (DL) models-based segmentation and classifications have recently been invented but they still have certain drawbacks.The data used to detect leukaemia is first pre processed, then segmented and the features are extracted and finally classified. Recent deep learning approaches and difficulties in detecting leukaemia are described in this article.

A New Graph Autoencoder-Based Consensus-Guided Model for scRNA-seq Cell Type Detection,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is famous for providing a microscopic view to help capture cellular heterogeneity. This characteristic has advanced the field of genomics by enabling the delicate differentiation of cell types. However, the properties of single-cell datasets, such as high dropout events, noise, and high dimensionality, are still a research challenge in the single-cell field. To utilize single-cell data more efficiently and to better explore the heterogeneity among cells, a new graph autoencoder (GAE)-based consensus-guided model (scGAC) is proposed in this article. The data are preprocessed into multiple top-level feature datasets. Then, feature learning is performed by using GAEs to generate new feature matrices, followed by similarity learning based on distance fusion methods. The learned similarity matrices are fed back to the GAEs to guide their feature learning process. Finally, the abovementioned steps are iterated continuously to integrate the final consistent similarity matrix and perform other related downstream analyses. The scGAC model can accurately identify critical features and effectively preserve the internal structure of the data. This can further improve the accuracy of cell type identification.",Feature extraction;Representation learning;Genetic algorithms;Sequential analysis;Optimization;Data models;Mathematical models;Distance fusion;graph autoencoder (GAE);integration algorithm;single-cell RNA-seq,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3190289
Cross-Domain Nuclei Detection in Histopathology Images Using Graph-Based Nuclei Feature Alignment,"As powerful tools deep neural networks have been successfully adopted for nuclei detection in histopathology images, whereas require the same probability distribution between training and testing data. However, domain shift among histopathology images widely exists in real-world applications and severely deteriorates the detection performance of deep neural networks. Despite encouraging results of existing domain adaptation methods, there remain challenges for cross-domain nuclei detection task. First, in view of the tiny size of nuclei, it is actually very difficult to obtain sufficient nuclei features, thus leading to a negative influence for feature alignment. Second, due to unavailable annotations in target domain, some extracted features contain background pixels and are thereby indiscriminative, which can largely confuse the alignment procedure. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose an end-to-end graph-based nuclei feature alignment (GNFA) method for boosting cross-domain nuclei detection. Concretely, sufficient nuclei features are generated from nuclei graph convolutional network (NGCN) by aggregating information of adjacent nuclei upon construction of nuclei graph for successful alignment. In addition, importance learning module (ILM) is designed to further select discriminative nuclei features for mitigating negative influence of background pixels in target domain during alignment. By utilizing sufficient and discriminative node features generated from GNFA, our method can successfully perform feature alignment and effectively alleviate domain shift problem for nuclei detection. Extensive experiments of multiple adaptation scenarios reveal that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain nuclei detection compared with existing domain adaptation methods.",Feature extraction;Histopathology;Task analysis;Bioinformatics;Image analysis;Convolutional neural networks;Annotations;Nuclei detection;domain adaptation;histopathology image analysis;graph convolutional network,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3280958
ERDUnet: An Efficient Residual Double-Coding Unet for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation is widely used in clinical diagnosis, and methods based on convolutional neural networks have been able to achieve high accuracy. However, it is still difficult to extract global context features, and the parameters are too large to be clinically applied. In this regard, we propose a novel network structure to improve the traditional encoder-decoder network model, which saves parameters while maintaining segmentation accuracy. We improve the feature extraction efficiency by constructing an encoder module that can simultaneously extract local features and global continuity information. A novel attention module is designed to optimize segmentation boundary regions while improving training efficiency. The feature transfer structure of the decoding part is also improved, which fully integrates the features of different levels to restore the spatial resolution more finely. We evaluate our model on seven different medical segmentation datasets, the 2018 Data Science Bowl Challenge (DSBC2018), the 2018 Lesion Boundary Segmentation Challenge (ISIC2018), the Gland Segmentation in Colon Histology Images Challenge (GlaS), Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-Instrument and Polypgen.

MS-DRT: A Multilevel and Multiscale Branch Learning Scheme for Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery,"The state detection of mechanical equipment is one of the important application fields of intelligent diagnosis. In this article, a multiscale dense residual network is developed to solve the problem of inefficient diagnosis of mechanical equipment in complex operating environments. The model improves the performance of the model from three aspects: pixel level, feature level, and decision level. At the pixel level, the introduction of data input frameworks with different granularities reduces the limitation of traditional models that only extract fault features on a single time scale, and enriches the utilization of state information of mechanical equipment. At the feature level, multiscale dense residual units are used to perform layer-by-layer explicit amplification and densification learning of global and local features. Make the model learn the fault information of different levels and depths to the maximum extent. In addition, the residual connection of interval sampling is used to correct the coding abnormal behavior to stabilize the diagnostic performance of the model. At the decision level, the original feature decision-making mode is changed, and the proposed regional mean strategy can efficiently aggregate multiscale features. The expression demands of each feature of model learning are considered. Through the state recognition of different mechanical equipment, it is identified that the model has excellent generalization ability. Finally, the general relationship between spectrum characteristics and filter parameters is explored to obtain a microscopic representation that the deep learning model extracts fault signal features.",Feature extraction;Convolution;Fault diagnosis;Kernel;Data models;Fans;Vibrations;Deep learning;fault diagnosis;multilevel decision;multiscale branching structure;rotating machinery,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,10.1109/TII.2023.3295426
Domain-Centroid-Guided Progressive Teacher-Based Knowledge Distillation for Source-Free Domain Adaptation of Histopathological Images,"Deep neural networks are commonly used for histopathology image analysis. However, such data-driven models are sensitive to style variances across scanners and suffer a significant performance degradation as a result. Although the network performance can be improved by using domain adaptation methods, the source dataset required to perform the adaptation process is generally unavailable. This study shows that the performance degradation of deep neural networks when applied to histopathology images is the result partly of the wide distribution of the features generated when inferring the features of the target model using the feature centers of the source model. To address this problem, a teacher–student framework, designated as domain-centroid-guided progressive teacher-based knowledge distillation (DCGP-KD), is proposed which aims to learn compact target features in order to provide more accurate pseudo labels for the target model without the need for the original source dataset. In the proposed framework, the class-wise feature centers of the source data are progressively adapted to the distribution of the target data, and compact target features are then generated by gathering the features based on their class-wise centers. A strategy is additionally proposed to prevent catastrophic forgetting during the progressive adaption process. Finally, a prediction consistency loss function is introduced to improve the robustness of the target dataset. The feasibility of the proposed framework is demonstrated experimentally for the illustrative case of the tumor classification of histopathological images with staining variations. The results show that DCGP-KD provides a promising assistive tool for pathologists in various histopathological analysis tasks.",Adaptation models;Feature extraction;Data models;Analytical models;Image color analysis;Task analysis;Histopathology;Histopathology image;knowledge distillation;progressive teacher–student adaption;source-free domain adaptation,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,10.1109/TAI.2023.3305331
Nucleus-Aware Self-Supervised Pretraining Using Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation for Histopathology Images,"Self-supervised pretraining attempts to enhance model performance by obtaining effective features from unlabeled data, and has demonstrated its effectiveness in the field of histopathology images. Despite its success, few works concentrate on the extraction of nucleus-level information, which is essential for pathologic analysis. In this work, we propose a novel nucleus-aware self-supervised pretraining framework for histopathology images. The framework aims to capture the nuclear morphology and distribution information through unpaired image-to-image translation between histopathology images and pseudo mask images. The generation process is modulated by both conditional and stochastic style representations, ensuring the reality and diversity of the generated histopathology images for pretraining. Further, an instance segmentation guided strategy is employed to capture instance-level information. The experiments on 7 datasets show that the proposed pretraining method outperforms supervised ones on Kather classification, multiple instance learning, and 5 dense-prediction tasks with the transfer learning protocol, and yields superior results than other self-supervised approaches on 8 semi-supervised tasks.

Wasserstein HOG: Local Directionality Extraction via Optimal Transport,"Directionally sensitive radiomic features including the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) have been shown to provide objective and quantitative measures for predicting disease outcomes in multiple cancers. However, radiomic features are sensitive to imaging variabilities including acquisition differences, imaging artifacts and noise, making them impractical for using in the clinic to inform patient care. We treat the problem of extracting robust local directionality features by mapping via optimal transport a given local image patch to an iso-intense patch of its mean. We decompose the transport map into sub-work costs each transporting in different directions. To test our approach, we evaluated the ability of the proposed approach to quantify tumor heterogeneity from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brain glioblastoma multiforme, computed tomography (CT) scans of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as longitudinal CT scans in lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. By considering the entropy difference of the extracted local directionality within tumor regions, we found that patients with higher entropy in their images, had significantly worse overall survival for all three datasets, which indicates that tumors that have images exhibiting flows in many directions may be more malignant. This may seem to reflect high tumor histologic grade or disorganization. Furthermore, by comparing the changes in entropy longitudinally using two imaging time points, we found patients with reduction in entropy from baseline CT are associated with longer overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.95, 95% confidence interval of 1.4-2.8,  ${p",Feature extraction;Computed tomography;Tumors;Entropy;Cancer;Radiomics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Optimal transport;MRI;CT;radiomic features;imaging processing,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2023.3325295
Center-Focused Affinity Loss for Class Imbalance Histology Image Classification,"Early-stage cancer diagnosis potentially improves the chances of survival for many cancer patients worldwide. Manual examination of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is a time-consuming task for analyzing tumor-microenvironment. To overcome this limitation, the conjunction of deep learning with computational pathology has been proposed to assist pathologists in efficiently prognosing the cancerous spread. Nevertheless, the existing deep learning methods are ill-equipped to handle fine-grained histopathology datasets. This is because these models are constrained via conventional softmax loss function, which cannot expose them to learn distinct representational embeddings of the similarly textured WSIs containing an imbalanced data distribution. To address this problem, we propose a novel center-focused affinity loss (CFAL) function that exhibits 1) constructing uniformly distributed class prototypes in the feature space, 2) penalizing difficult samples, 3) minimizing intra-class variations, and 4) placing greater emphasis on learning minority class features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed CFAL loss function on two publicly available breast and colon cancer datasets having varying levels of imbalanced classes. The proposed CFAL function shows better discrimination abilities as compared to the popular loss functions such as ArcFace, CosFace, and Focal loss. Moreover, it outperforms several SOTA methods for histology image classification across both datasets.",Histopathology;Cancer;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Image classification;Deep learning;Training;Data imbalance learning;fine-grained classification;histology image classification;supervised clustering;and whole slide image analysis,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3336372
Neural Graph Refinement for Robust Recognition of Nuclei Communities in Histopathological Landscape,"Accurate classification of nuclei communities is an important step towards timely treating the cancer spread. Graph theory provides an elegant way to represent and analyze nuclei communities within the histopathological landscape in order to perform tissue phenotyping and tumor profiling tasks. Many researchers have worked on recognizing nuclei regions within the histology images in order to grade cancerous progression. However, due to the high structural similarities between nuclei communities, defining a model that can accurately differentiate between nuclei pathological patterns still needs to be solved. To surmount this challenge, we present a novel approach, dubbed neural graph refinement, that enhances the capabilities of existing models to perform nuclei recognition tasks by employing graph representational learning and broadcasting processes. Based on the physical interaction of the nuclei, we first construct a fully connected graph in which nodes represent nuclei and adjacent nodes are connected to each other via an undirected edge. For each edge and node pair, appearance and geometric features are computed and are then utilized for generating the neural graph embeddings. These embeddings are used for diffusing contextual information to the neighboring nodes, all along a path traversing the whole graph to infer global information over an entire nuclei network and predict pathologically meaningful communities. Through rigorous evaluation of the proposed scheme across four public datasets, we showcase that learning such communities through neural graph refinement produces better results that outperform state-of-the-art methods.",Histopathology;Feature extraction;Cancer;Image edge detection;Task analysis;Monitoring;Image segmentation;Nuclei communities;graph representational learning;histology images;colorectal cancer,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2023.3337666
CAWM: Class-Aware Weight Map for Improved Semi-Supervised Nuclei Segmentation,"Due to the rich histopathological information of nuclei in whole slide images, nuclei segmentation becomes essential for medical analysis. Since collecting sufficient pixel-wise annotations for supervised training of nuclei segmentation networks is challenging, semi-supervised nuclei segmentation methods have been extensively studied. In particular, many of them use pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled images for training the segmentation model. In this Letter, we propose a new pseudo-label handling method for semi-supervised nuclei segmentation. Specifically, based on our observation that nuclear features within the same image share high similarities, we define confidence maps for pseudo-labels and use them to adapt consistency regularization and contrastive loss measures. From extensive experiments on three public datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other semi-supervised training methods.",Image segmentation;Training;Pathology;Medical diagnostic imaging;Feature extraction;Annotations;Loss measurement;Mean-teacher model;nuclei segmentation;pseudo-label;semi-supervised segmentation,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,10.1109/LSP.2023.3342719
Histopathological Cancer Detection Using Intra-Domain Transfer Learning and Ensemble Learning,"Cancer is a leading global cause of death. Histopathology image analysis is widely recognized as the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, playing a crucial role in early detection and reducing mortality rates. However, this diagnostic task is performed manually by pathologists, leading to high human errors and variabilities due to the huge number of images to screen and tissue complexities. With the emergence of deep learning, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in computer-aided diagnosis, there is a growing interest from the medical community to automate the labor-intensive manual image screening. Despite its promising performance, deep learning models still encounter challenges when it comes to extracting comprehensive histopathological features for optimal results. To tackle this issue, our study introduces deep learning models based on intra-domain transfer learning and ensemble learning. We evaluated these models on public histopathology datasets, including Gastric Histopathology Sub-size Image Database (GasHisSDB), Chaoyang colorectal, and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (CPTAC-CCRCC). Our models achieved state-of-the-art accuracy: 99.78% on GasHisSDB, 85.69% on Chaoyang, and 99.17% on CPTAC-CCRCC. These results highlight our models’ ability to extract rich features and perform well on low-resolution histopathology images. Thus, our models have the potential to assist pathologists, reduce their workload, and enhance patient survival rates.",Histopathology;Cancer;Transfer learning;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Task analysis;Ensemble learning;Detection algorithms;Convolutional neural networks;Cancer detection;convolutional neural network;deep learning;ensemble model;histopathology;transfer learning,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3343465
Lymphocyte Detection Method Based on Improved YOLOv5,"To address the limitations of traditional burdensome and time-consuming manual diagnosis of Sjogren’s syndrome, this study proposes and implements an improved version of YOLOv5s algorithm, named YOLOv5s-MSS. Using YOLOv5s-MSS, we are able to detect lymphocytic infiltrative lesions in pathological images and provide assistance for pathological diagnosis. Given the small size of lymphocytes and the difficulty in distinguishing them, we made four improvements to the YOLOv5s model. Firstly, we replace the original CIOU loss function with the Focal-SIOU loss function to accelerate model convergence and improve the detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the multi-head self-attention module into the backbone to enhance the model’s ability to capture long range dependencies and overcome the challenges posed by complex background. Furthermore, we introduce the Shuffle Attention module into the neck, which enhances the model’s ability to fuse features from both spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we remove the 1/32 downsampling section in the neck and the corresponding large object detection head. This not only enhances accuracy but also reduces parameters and model complexity. Experimental results show that YOLOv5s-MSS achieves a mAP, Precision, and Recall of 93.2%, 87.2%, and 89%, representing increases of 2.9%, 2.6%, and 2.8% compared to the original YOLOv5s model. Additionally, YOLOv5s-MSS reduces the parameters by 28.2%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and value of YOLOv5s-MSS for lymphocyte detection.",YOLO;Pathology;Neck;Feature extraction;Solid modeling;Training;Lymphatic system;Attention mechanism;focal-SIOU;lymphocytes detection;multi-head self-attention;YOLOv5,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3347451
Improved Water Strider Algorithm With Convolutional Autoencoder for Lung and Colon Cancer Detection on Histopathological Images,"Lung and colon cancers are deadly diseases that can develop concurrently in organs and undesirably affect human life in some special cases. The detection of these cancers from histopathological images poses a complex challenge in medical diagnostics. Advanced image processing techniques, including deep learning algorithms, offer a solution by analyzing intricate patterns and structures in histopathological slides. The integration of artificial intelligence in histopathological analysis not only improves the proficiency of cancer detection but also holds the potential to increase prognostic assessments, eventually contributing to effective treatment strategies for patients with lung and colon cancers. This manuscript presents an Improved Water Strider Algorithm with Convolutional Autoencoder for Lung and Colon Cancer Detection (IWSACAE-LCCD) on HIs. The major aim of the IWSACAE-LCCD technique aims to detect lung and colon cancer. For noise removal process, median filtering (MF) approach can be used. Besides, deep convolutional neural network based MobileNetv2 model can be applied as a feature extractor with IWSA based hyperparameter optimizer. Finally, convolutional autoencoder (CAE) model can be applied to detect the presence of lung and colon cancer. To enhance the detection results of the IWSACAE-LCCD technique, a series of simulations were performed. The obtained results highlighted that the IWSACAE-LCCD technique outperforms other approaches in terms of different measures.",Cancer;Feature extraction;Colon;Lung;Cancer detection;Medical diagnostic imaging;Convolutional neural networks;Biomedical image processing;Histopathology;Machine learning;Medical image analysis;histopathological images;cancer detection;machine learning;deep learning,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3346894
Discriminative Dictionary Learning Using Penalized Rank-1 Approximation for Breast Cancer Classification With Imbalanced Dataset,"In histopathological image analysis, the feature extraction task for classification proves to be demanding. This difficulty arises from the assortment of histological features appropriate for individual problems and the intricate presence of diverse geometric structures. The method proposed in this study leverages dictionary learning and sparse coding techniques to create priors tailored to specific targets, which is essential for classification purposes. Our approach introduces Penalized Sequential Discriminative Dictionary Learning (PSDDL), designed to integrate histopathological image features by acquiring structured, class-specific dictionaries. Initially, PSDDL constructs a dictionary from the input data, incorporating label information for each class. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm introduces a penalty and regularization term to amplify the efficacy of the acquired dictionary. Furthermore, the proposed method also tackles the class imbalance in the dataset by leveraging dictionary learning. Mainly, under-sampling is performed on the dataset, and the number of samples of fewer classes is kept for all categories and passed to the dictionary learning algorithm. Extensive experimental results highlight a notable enhancement in classification performance. The proposed structured discriminative dictionary learning technique consistently produces improved accuracies compared to other contemporary methods for classifying the BreakHis breast cancer dataset. Integrating class-specific information into the process of dictionary learning paves the way for enriching the interpretive capabilities of machine learning models while delving deeper into our comprehension of the complex and intricate structures inherent in biological tissues.",Machine learning;Biomedical imaging;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Training;Breast cancer;Task analysis;Image analysis;Breast cancer;cancer diagnosis;dictionary learning;histopathological image analysis;image processing;sparse representation,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3347339
Corrosion Response of AM350 to Irradiated CFC-11 in the Heat Redistribution System (HRS) for Europa Clipper,"Europa Clipper is a NASA-JPL mission to create a radiation tolerant spacecraft that will perform a detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter’s moon, Europa. As part of an initiative to investigate ""icy worlds"" to find locations in the galaxy that have suitable conditions for life, spacecraft with significant radiation resistance must be designed to withstand the harsh Jovian environment, and therefore require rigorous testing of traditional spacecraft materials under new radiation extremes. Among the critical systems on Europa Clipper, the Heat Redistribution System (HRS) is comprised of multiple pumps, fluid movement devices, and mechanisms to move heat to and from components using a trichlorofluoromethane (CFC11) working fluid. From a materials standpoint, a primary concern is the potential for CFC-11 radiolysis bi-products and adventitious water to exacerbate the corrosion of ferrous alloys. In particular, within the HRS, the bellows accumulator stores and flows the fluid to parts of the spacecraft that require heat transfer, and the internal edge-welded bellows are constructed from AM350 stainless steel. Because this ferrous alloy was selected based on heritage designs from non-Jovian environments at relatively low radiation conditions, the effects of CFC-11 radiolysis products on long-term material stability were unknown.In this work, we aimed to understand the impact of CFC-11 radiolysis bi-products and adventitious water on the corrosion of AM350 employed in the bellows accumulator in the HRS. Configuration-specific samples of the material were completely submerged in either irradiated or non-irradiated CFC-11; samples in irradiated CFC-11 were then further exposed to radiation levels commensurate to those observed on the Europa Clipper mission via a Co60 gamma radiation source, and compared directly with non-irradiated freon and freon-absent controls over specific time intervals (5 days, 4 weeks, 2 months, 4 months). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy, confocal microscopy, metallurgical analysis of cross-sections, deionized (DI) water rinse analysis for metals and halides, and water content measurements were used to characterize the extent of corrosion of irradiated samples at each time period. Notably, relative to non-irradiated freon and freon-absent controls, AM350 samples clearly exhibited surface-level morphological features (i.e., pitting) in irradiated freon consistent with corrosion mechanisms. Deionized (DI) water rinse analysis for metals and halides corroborated microscopic observation of pitting on AM350 samples, showing an increased iron and chloride content with radiation exposure. If it is deemed necessary to mitigate corrosion of AM350 in the accumulator bellows, future work aims to test a possible getter system in the HRS to facilitate the removal of water and chloride from irradiated CFC-11, and ultimately improve HRS designs for extreme radiation environments for both fly-by and landed missions to Europa (Europa Clipper, Europa Lander), Enceladus (Enceladus Orbilander), and beyond.",Bellows;Scanning electron microscopy;Fluids;Optical microscopy;Corrosion;Saturn;Welding,INPROCEEDINGS,2024,2024 IEEE Aerospace Conference,10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521060
Advancing Oncology Diagnostics: AI-Enabled Early Detection of Lung Cancer Through Hybrid Histological Image Analysis,"Against the backdrop of the pervasive global challenge of cancer, with particular emphasis on lung cancer (LC), this study centers its investigation on the critical realm of early detection leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) within the domain of histological image analysis. Through the fusion of DenseNet201 with color histogram techniques, a novel hybrid feature set emerges, engineered to elevate classification accuracy. The comprehensive evaluation encompasses eight diverse machine learning (ML) algorithms, spanning from K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to Support Vector Machines (SVM), including notable contenders such as LightGBM (LGBM), CatBoost, XGBoost, decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and multinomial naive Bayes (MultinomialNB).

Automated Detection of Cell Nuclei in Histopathology Slide Images: A Comprehensive Approach for Diagnostic Support,"Histopathology slide images serve as microscopic representations of tissue samples vital for disease diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. This paper proposes an approach for automated detection of cell nuclei in histopathology slide images, aiming to assist pathologists in their diagnostic processes. The method involves a sequence of image processing steps, including resizing, grayscale conversion, noise removal, adaptive thresholding, object removal, and hole filling for image segmentation. A morphological opening is applied to eliminate small structures, followed by a Circular Hough Transform for nucleus detection with specific radii and sensitivity settings. The Watershed transform, using detected nuclei as markers, enhances the visualization of irregular shapes. Promising results are demonstrated in the detection of nuclei in colon, adrenal, and thyroid cells, offering potential support to pathologists in diagnosis and evaluation.

Multimodal Siamese Model for Breast Cancer Survival Prediction,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers, and accurate survival prediction can help doctors make appropriate treatment decisions for patients, thereby improving patient survival rates. To enhance the performance of survival prediction for breast cancer patients, a multimodal siamese model is proposed. The model utilizes a Siamese-RegNet to extract representative features, which not only considers the relationship between pathological patches but also extracts survival-related features. Moreover, The proposed model takes both pathological images and clinical data as multimodal input, which is essential to survival prediction and can improve predictive performance. The experimental results on the public dataset TCGA-BRCA and external test dataset GMUCH-BRCA demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a better concordance index (C-index) of 0.756 and 0.567, respectively.",Pathology;Correlation;Medical services;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;breast cancer;survival prediction;multimodal data;deep learning;Siamese network,INPROCEEDINGS,2024,"2024 4th International Conference on Neural Networks, Information and Communication (NNICE)",10.1109/NNICE61279.2024.10498910
Effective Categorization of Lung Abnormalities using Squeezenet Features and Machine Learning Models,"Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related fatalities in the developed countries. This is due to the changes in lifestyle of the peple and also it is clinically evident only after progressing to advanced stages. Therefore, early detection of lung cancer is essential for patient survival. X-ray, computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging approaches are used to detect the lung cancer. In this study, it is aimed to develop CAD system to classify the different types of lung cancers using histopathological images. Deep learning techniques are widely used techniques in the medical image classification. Results show that logistic regression is found to achieve an accuracy of 96% in differentiating the tumor cells. High value of 94% for MCC clearly indicates that the features extracted using squeezenet features has the ability to categorize abnormality. SVM with RBF kernel displays better peformance in identifying the categories of tumor with an accuracy of 89.8%. k-NN model with by distance weights is found to show comparatively high peformance in detecting the abnormalities in the images with accuracy and AUC values of 98.4% and 99.8% respectively.

Histopathology Image Analysis Utilizes Homology-Based Feature Extraction for Accurate Diagnosis of Various Lung Diseases,"Histopathology image analysis is pivotal for diagnosing lung diseases, providing critical insights into tissue abnormalities for accurate medical assessments. Despite its significance, challenges arise from interpretational subjectivity and handling diverse tissue types, limiting its widespread application. The lung and colon histopathology dataset, comprising 25,000 color images, serves as a valuable resource in comprehensive medical research, offering diverse samples for detailed analysis and diagnosis. The proposed method introduces innovation by leveraging homology-based image processing for feature extraction, integrating the Unsharp Masking method in preprocessing. Classification through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ensures a thorough and accurate analysis of histopathological images in lung disease diagnosis.

Cross-Station Continual Aurora Image Classification,"The existing deep learning-based methods have shown great potential for the aurora image classification problem. However, there are many differences in the morphology and distribution patterns of aurora images from different observation stations, and the differences between Antarctic and Arctic aurora images are particularly obvious. Currently, there are 76 research stations in 31 countries in Antarctica and more than 100 land-based stations in the Arctic. In the face of the difference in morphology and distribution patterns between Antarctic and Arctic auroras, the current popular methods cannot maintain a consistent classification ability. At the same time, it is important to effectively use both historical and real-time information to enable continual learning of aurora classification models to take full advantage of the high temporal resolution of streaming aurora image data. In this article, a cross-station continual (CSC) aurora image classification framework is proposed to tackle these problems. To simulate a cross-station aurora image data stream, aurora images from three observation stations located in the Antarctic and the Arctic were selected and split into mini-batches in a chronological order to form the cross-station streaming (CSS) aurora image dataset. Based on the vision transformer (ViT) model, the CSC framework sequentially learns the semantic representation of streaming aurora data by learning dynamic prompts in the prompt bank selected by the average cosine distance. For the cross-station aurora discrepancy phenomenon, a local–global enhancement (LGE) module is designed, by organically combining the local and global semantics of aurora images to reduce the microscopic intraclass similarity and macroscopic interclass confusion. Extensive experiments conducted on the CSS dataset show that the proposed method can achieve efficient continual learning of streaming aurora data and a competitive classification accuracy under the condition of joint training of data from multiple observation stations.",Magnetosphere;Ion radiation effects;Task analysis;Streaming media;Image classification;Deep learning;Training;Aurora classification;continual learning;cross station;local–global semantic enhancement;streaming data,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,10.1109/TGRS.2024.3387943
A Novel Digitized Microscopic Images of ZN-Stained Sputum Smear and Its Classification Based on IUATLD Grades,"Microscopic detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) from mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN)-stained sputum samples is a crucial step in the detection of TB (tuberculosis) disease. Pathologists encounter many challenges that may result in incorrect diagnoses, such as the heterogeneous shape and irregular appearance of MTB, low-quality ZN staining, and errors in in scanning each of the field of view (FoV) using a conventional microscope. Additionally, multiple manual observations may cause fatigue that leads to human error. Several studies have created microscopic imaging databases of sputum samples, aiding researchers in creating computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for tuberculosis, which is a promising method that offers timely, reliable, and repeatable assistance. Nevertheless, the implementation of CAD systems for TB diagnosis remains an area of ongoing research and development owing to the lack of microscopic image datasets of sputum samples, which represent whole-slide imaging (WSI) that follows the WHO (World Health Organization) regulations. To address this issue, this study developed a novel digitized microscopic image from sputum smear samples of Indonesian patients in the WSI that conform to the WHO regulation. These images are collected as a Microscopic Imaging Database of Tuberculosis Indonesia (MIDTI).

Classification of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Based on Combination of GLCM and L*a*b* on Colposcopy Image Using Machine Learning,"Colposcopy can potentially improve diagnostic ca-pabilities to guide cervical biopsies, contributing to improved cervical cancer screening. The previous study compared diagnostic accuracy in histologic CIN between senior and junior col-poscopists, the senior colposcopists showing higher sensitivity but lower specificity than the junior. This research has significantly contributed to categorizing CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3 by utilizing features extracted from GLCM and L*a*b* color spaces, using machine learning techniques to aid cervical pre-cancer diagnosis. Three machine learning tools were random forest, decision tree, and extra trees. The results of this study have shown that the extra tress classifier has the best performance value by using six GLCM features: contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, dissimilarity, asm, and one L*a*b* feature, namely median_1. The performance results have improved to 0.98 accuracy, 0.97 sensitivity, and 0.98 specificity. Processing CIN1 data on GLCM features took an average of 20.70 s and L*a*b* for 21.74 s. The processing of CIN2 data on GLCM features is 27.57 s, and L*a*b* is 27.37 s. The processing of CIN3 data on GLCM is 31.22 s, and L*a*b* is 31.38 s. In aggregate, the lowest average processing time using the GLCM features was 26.20 s. Based on the testing results, this research produces an FNR of 0.015, which indicates that this research in the future, when applied to medical care, has a slight possibility of diagnostic errors.

An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Integrated System for Automatic Detection of Dengue From Images of Blood Smears Using Transfer Learning,"Dengue fever is a rapidly increasing mosquito-borne ailment spread by the virus DENV in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. It is a significant public health problem and accounts for many deaths globally. Implementing more effective methods that can more accurately detect dengue cases is challenging. The theme of this digital pathology-associated research is automatic dengue detection from peripheral blood smears (PBS) employing deep learning (DL) techniques. In recent years, DL has been significantly employed for automated computer-assisted diagnosis of various diseases from medical images. This paper explores pre-trained convolution neural networks (CNNs) for automatic dengue fever detection. Transfer learning (TL) is executed on three state-of-the-art CNNs – ResNet50, MobileNetV3Small, and MobileNetV3Large, to customize the models for differentiating the dengue-infected blood smears from the healthy ones. The dataset used to design and test the models contains 100x magnified dengue-infected and healthy control digital microscopic PBS images. The models are validated with a 5-fold cross-validation framework and tested on unseen data. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), is eventually applied to the models to allow visualization of the precise regions on the smears most instrumental in making the predictions. While all three transferred pre-trained CNN models performed well (above 98% overall classification accuracy), MobileNetV3Small is the recommended model for this classification problem due to its significantly less computationally demanding characteristics. Transferred pre-trained CNN based on MobileNetV3Small yielded Accuracy, Recall, Specificity, Precision, F1 Score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.982 ± 0.011, 0.973 ± 0.027, 0.99 ± 0.013, 0.989 ± 0.015, 0.981 ± 0.012 and 0.982 ± 0.012 respectively, averaged over the five folds on the unseen dataset.

Gland Segmentation Via Dual Encoders and Boundary-Enhanced Attention,"Accurate and automated gland segmentation on pathological images can assist pathologists in diagnosing the malignancy of colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, due to various gland shapes, severe deformation of malignant glands, and overlapping adhesions between glands. Gland segmentation has always been very challenging. To address these problems, we propose a DEA model. This model consists of two branches: the backbone encoding and decoding network and the local semantic extraction network. The backbone encoding and decoding network extracts advanced Semantic features, uses the proposed feature decoder to restore feature space information, and then enhances the boundary features of the gland through boundary enhancement attention. The local semantic extraction network uses the pre-trained DeepLabv3+ as a Local semantic-guided encoder to realize the extraction of edge features.

LightGBM: A Leading Force in Breast Cancer Diagnosis Through Machine Learning and Image Processing,"The early diagnosis of breast cancer (BC), a prominent global cause of mortality, necessitates the development of innovative diagnostic strategies. This study leverages machine learning (ML) and advanced image processing techniques to analyze histopathology images, thereby augmenting the capabilities for BC diagnosis. A robust feature extraction (FE) pipeline is developed, integrating techniques such as color histogram analysis, contour FE, hu moments, and haralick texture features. Ten ML algorithms, including LightGBM (LGBM), CatBoost, and XGBoost, are systematically evaluated across varying magnifications of the BreakHis dataset to assess their diagnostic performance. The research introduces a novel approach by combining distinct FE techniques, enhancing the model’s ability to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues with exceptional accuracy. These integrated techniques significantly elevate BC diagnostic accuracy and reliability, holding the potential to positively impact patient outcomes and healthcare systems. Notably, the combination of the FE pipeline and LGBM achieves the highest accuracy, reported in two forms: before augmentation accuracies (0.9598 for  $40 \times $ , 0.9516 for  $100 \times $ , 0.9652 for  $200 \times $ , 0.9535 for  $400 \times $ , and 0.9570 for all magnifications combined) and after augmentation accuracies (0.9949 for  $40 \times $ , 0.9870 for  $100 \times $ , 0.9987 for  $200 \times $ , and 0.9918 for  $400 \times $ ) for the classification of magnification histopathological images. Moreover, the study highlights the crucial role of augmentation in further refining classification accuracy. Extending its applicability, the proposed method is also successfully applied to the classification of lung colon cancer images (LC25000 dataset), achieving an impressive accuracy of 0.9983. The model demonstrates its effectiveness and adaptability as a compelling method for histopathological image classification.

"DRD-UNet, a UNet-Like Architecture for Multi-Class Breast Cancer Semantic Segmentation","Staining of histological slides with Hematoxylin and Eosin is widely used in clinical and laboratory settings as these dyes reveal nuclear structures as well as cytoplasm and collagen. For cancer diagnosis, these slides are used to recognize tissues and morphological changes. Tissue semantic segmentation is therefore important and at the same time a challenging and time-consuming task. This paper describes a UNet-like deep learning architecture called DRD-UNet, which adds a novel processing block called DRD (Dilation, Residual, and Dense block) to a UNet architecture. DRD is formed by the combination of dilated convolutions (D), residual connections (R), and dense layers (D).

Improving Medical Experience With Lung Histopathological Image Classification for Smart Healthcare,"With the rapid development of smart healthcare, digital histopathological images are playing an increasingly important role in disease diagnosis. Due to factors such as diverse pathological information and individual patient differences in histopathological images, the differences of intra-class sample in may be greater than the differences in inter-class sample. Additionally, collecting a large number of labeled images is very difficult. This study proposes semi-supervised dictionary pair learning (SSDPL) algorithm with local graph embedding and discriminant coding for lung histopathological image classification. All samples are used to train the synthesis-analysis dictionary pair in semi-supervised learning. Based on the graph structure of the neighborhood, a local graph embedding term is constructed. Considering the geometric neighborhood topological relationships between samples for each class, the local structural information can be accurately represented to the analysis dictionary, so the coding coefficients corresponding to samples with high similarity can maintain a high degree of similarity. Based on mean coefficient matrices, the discriminant coding term is introduced to improve the separability of each class.

Softmax-Driven Active Shape Model for Segmenting Crowded Objects in Digital Pathology Images,"Automated segmentation of histological structures in microscopy images is a crucial step in computer-aided diagnosis framework. However, this task remains a challenging problem due to issues like overlapping and touching objects, shape variation, and background complexity. In this work, we present a novel and effective approach for instance segmentation through the synergistic combination of two deep learning networks (detection and segmentation models) with active shape models. Our method, called softmax-driven active shape model (SD-ASM), uses information from deep neural networks to initialize and evolve a dynamic deformable model. The detection module enables treatment of individual objects separately, while the segmentation map precisely outlines boundaries. We conducted extensive tests using various state-of-the-art architectures on two standard datasets for segmenting crowded objects like cell nuclei - MoNuSeg and CoNIC. The proposed SD-ASM consistently outperformed reference methods, achieving up to 8.93% higher Aggregated Jaccard Index (AJI) and 9.84% increase in Panoptic Quality (PQ) score compared to segmentation networks alone. To emphasize versatility, we also applied SD-ASMs to segment hepatic steatosis and renal tubules, where individual structure identification is critical. Once again, integration of SD-ASM with deep models enhanced segmentation accuracy beyond prior works by up to 6.2% in AJI and 38% decrease in Hausdorff Distance. The proposed approach demonstrates effectiveness in accurately segmenting touching objects across multiple clinical scenarios.",Image segmentation;Instance segmentation;Deep learning;Active shape model;Task analysis;Image color analysis;Digital systems;Shape measurement;Pathology;Computer aided diagnosis;Histopathology;Microscopy;Biomedical imaging;Digital pathology;deep learning;hybrid frameworks;nuclei instance segmentation;active shape models,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3369916
Breast Cancer Histopathology Images Classification Through Multi-View Augmented Contrastive Learning and Pre-Learning Knowledge Distillation,"Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women, and accurate classification of benign and malignant breast cancer histopathology images is critical for diagnosis and treatment. Knowledge distillation techniques have recently received considerable attention for enabling cost-effective image classification of breast cancer histopathology images. However, there are still challenges, including the inefficient extraction of global and local features from breast cancer histopathology images by the teacher network, and the over-prioritization of feature fusion within the same encoder layer, which tends to neglect valuable information from adjacent encoder layers during knowledge extraction. To address these challenges, we propose a method that combines multi-view augmented contrastive learning and pre-learning knowledge distillation. Multi-view augmented contrastive learning improves the ability of the teacher network to extract global and local features. Pre-learning knowledge distillation merges features from adjacent encoder layers of the teacher network, reducing feature loss between these layers. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in classifying histopathology images of benign and malignant breast cancer, achieving excellent results on the BreakHis dataset. These results confirm our method as an effective tool for the classification of benign and malignant breast cancer histopathology images.",Breast cancer;Histopathology;Feature extraction;Self-supervised learning;Computational modeling;Knowledge transfer;Knowledge representation;Knowledge discovery;Contrast resolution;Image classification;Biomedical imaging;Knowledge distillation;contrastive learning;breast cancer histopathology image;global feature;local feature,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3366185
RotU-Net: An Innovative U-Net With Local Rotation for Medical Image Segmentation,"In recent years, both convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformers have demonstrated impressive feature extraction capabilities in the field of medical image segmentation. A common approach is to utilize a combination of CNN and transformer encoders to efficiently learn both local and global features, making them widely adopted techniques in semantic segmentation of medical images. However, challenges remain due to the limited sample size of medical image datasets and the intricate foreground edge information in these images. These challenges make it difficult for models to capture key structures and information related to foreground edge details, especially when trained on smaller datasets. To address these issues, we propose a U-Net-based model called “Rotate U-Net” (RotU-Net). Our model design is inspired by the successful U-Net architecture, which is characterized by direct connections between encoders and decoders, and skipping connections at multiple resolutions. Meanwhile, we propose weight rotator as a feature extraction module, which enhances network to discriminate edge information in the foreground region by computing partial element correlations to improve the network to focus on the foreground region while reducing redundant information in the features. Finally, we have validated RotU-Net on the Synapse Multi-Organ Segmentation Dataset (Synapse) and the Segmentation of Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cells in Microscopic Images (SegPC). The experimental results show that RotU-Net with a very small number of parameters achieves impressive performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of RotU-Net.",Transformers;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Decoding;Convolutional neural networks;Medical diagnostic imaging;Spatial resolution;Biomedical image processing;Weight measurement;Medical image segmentation;U-Net;weight rotation,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3363410
Discriminative Dictionary Learning Using Penalized Rank-1 Approximation for Breast Cancer Classification With Imbalanced Dataset,"In histopathological image analysis, the feature extraction task for classification proves to be demanding. This difficulty arises from the assortment of histological features appropriate for individual problems and the intricate presence of diverse geometric structures. The method proposed in this study leverages dictionary learning and sparse coding techniques to create priors tailored to specific targets, which is essential for classification purposes. Our approach introduces Penalized Sequential Discriminative Dictionary Learning (PSDDL), designed to integrate histopathological image features by acquiring structured, class-specific dictionaries. Initially, PSDDL constructs a dictionary from the input data, incorporating label information for each class. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm introduces a penalty and regularization term to amplify the efficacy of the acquired dictionary. Furthermore, the proposed method also tackles the class imbalance in the dataset by leveraging dictionary learning. Mainly, under-sampling is performed on the dataset, and the number of samples of fewer classes is kept for all categories and passed to the dictionary learning algorithm. Extensive experimental results highlight a notable enhancement in classification performance. The proposed structured discriminative dictionary learning technique consistently produces improved accuracies compared to other contemporary methods for classifying the BreakHis breast cancer dataset. Integrating class-specific information into the process of dictionary learning paves the way for enriching the interpretive capabilities of machine learning models while delving deeper into our comprehension of the complex and intricate structures inherent in biological tissues.",Machine learning;Biomedical imaging;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Training;Breast cancer;Task analysis;Image analysis;Breast cancer;cancer diagnosis;dictionary learning;histopathological image analysis;image processing;sparse representation,ARTICLE,2024,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3347339
Roundness curve for classification of cell phase on microscopic image,"Object shape recognition is important for cell microscopic image. Previous works have used circularity to describe the shape feature for different objects. In this paper, we propose an alternative shape feature, roundness curve, to represent the shape of object and classify cell microscopic image. The roundness curve is extracted based on the central projection method. Cell images are first segmented by applying the mathematical morphology method to binary images, which are converted from original microscopic images. Then, centroid of each object is calculated. The centroid projects radials to acquire projection value in pre-defined directions. The roundness curve in an orthogonal coordinate system is set up with the projection values and their indices on its two axes respectively.

Wall-adherent cells segmentation based on cross-entropy and watershed transform,"The microscopic image processing technology is a new solving approach to segment and count wall-adherent cells in anti-virus experiment in vitro. But the segmentation is very stubborn because of the cells’ multiformity.This paper presents a segmentation strategy based on cross-entropy and watershed transform to segment and count the wall-adherent cells. Firstly, Top-Hat transform is used to enhance the original cells microscopic image. Suppose the conditional distributions of object and background are modeled with normal distributions, maximum between-class cross-entropy threshold segments the image into binary one. Then morphological filters reduce the burrs and holes in binary image and watershed transform further segments the cells by sigle-pixel wide edges. Finally, the cells are counted by labeling them.The experiments show that this strategy is effective, simply and strongly adaptive to lighting.

Gene Signature Selection for Cancer Prediction Using an Integrated Approach of Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machine,"Classification of tumor types based on genomic information is essential for improving future cancer diagnosis and drug development. Since DNA microarray studies produce a large amount of data, effective analytical methods have to be developed to sort out whether specific cancer samples have distinctive features of gene expression over normal samples or other types of cancer samples. In this paper, an integrated approach of support vector machine (SVM) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for this purpose. The proposed approach can simultaneously optimize the feature subset and the classifier through a common solution coding mechanism. As an illustration, the proposed approach is applied in searching the combinational gene signatures for predicting histologic response to chemotherapy of osteosarcoma patients, which is the most common malignant bone tumor in children. Cross-validation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods in terms of classification accuracy. Further validation using an independent dataset shows misclassification of only one of fourteen patient samples suggesting that the selected gene signatures can reflect the chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.",Support vector machines;Classification algorithms;Optimization;Tumors;Cancer;Genetic algorithms;Surgery,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence),10.1109/CEC.2008.4630802
A non-invasive diffuse reflectance optical spectroscopic imaging system to characterize tissue,"Optical Imaging i.e., medical imaging with light radiation is gaining importance especially for early detection of cancer. The functional state of tissue can influence its optical properties. Functional optical imaging capitalizes on the changing optical properties of tissue by using light to measure physiological changes. The basis for this imaging method arise from the differences in the spectra obtained from the normal and diseased tissue owing to the multiple physiological change associated with increased vasculature, cellularity, oxygen consumption and edema in tumour. The proposed non-invasive technique can distinguish healthy from pathological tissue based on their microscopic morphology and the variations in their diffuse reflectance spectra. This measurement allows quantitative assessment of certain physiological parameters which leads to non-invasive cancer diagnosis. An optical fiber spectroscopic imaging system is set up for this purpose, which is safe, portable and very affordable relative to other imaging modalities. The method involves exposure of skin surface to white light produced by an incandescent source. The back scattered photons emerging from various layers of tissue are detected by spectrometer resulting in tissue surface emission profile.

Multi-feature contour evolution for automatic live cell segmentation in time lapse imagery,"Cell boundary segmentation in live cell image sequences is the first step towards quantitative analysis of cell motion and behavior. The time lapse microscopy imaging produces large volumes of image sequence collections which requires fast and robust automatic segmentation of cell boundaries to utilize further automated tools such as cell tracking to quantify and classify cell behavior. This paper presents a methodology that is based on utilizing the temporal context of the cell image sequences to accurately delineate the boundaries of non-homogeneous cells. A novel flux tensor-based detection of moving cells provides initial localization that is further refined by a multi-feature level set-based method using an efficient additive operator splitting scheme.

In the last years, the possibility of patterning the Porous Silicon (PSi) with photolithographic processes has been investigated in silicon micromachining. Unfortunately, the masking process of PSi by using standard photoresist presents remarkable difficulties since the low resistance of the polymer to the electrochemical process. The PSi localized laser oxidation process is a good and cheaper alternative to the traditional photolithographic method to realize micropatterned structures.

Improving renal cell carcinoma classification by automatic region of interest selection,"In this paper, we present an improved automated system for classification of pathological image data of renal cell carcinoma. The task of analyzing tissue biopsies, generally performed manually by expert pathologists, is extremely challenging due to the variability in the tissue morphology, the preparation of tissue specimen, and the image acquisition process. Due to the complexity of this task and heterogeneity of patient tissue, this process suffers from inter-observer and intra-observer variability. In continuation of our previous work, which proposed a knowledge-based automated system, we observe that real life clinical biopsy images which contain necrotic regions and glands significantly degrade the classification process. Following the pathologistpsilas technique of focusing on selected region of interest (ROI), we propose a simple ROI selection process which automatically rejects the glands and necrotic regions thereby improving the classification accuracy.

Using spiral intensity profile to quantify head and neck cancer,"During the analysis of microscopy images, researchers locate regions of interest (ROI) and extract relevant information within it. Identifying the ROI is mostly done manually and subjectively by pathologists. Computer algorithms could help in reducing their workload and improve reproducibility. In particular, we want to assess the validity of the folic acid receptor as a biomarker for head and neck cancer. We are only interested in folic acid receptors appearing in cancerous tissue. Therefore, the first step is to segment images into cancerous and noncancerous regions. We propose to use a spiral intensity profile for segmentation of light microscopy images. Many algorithms identify objects in an image by considering pixel intensity and spatial information separately. Our algorithm integrates intensity and spatial information by considering the change, or profile, of pixel intensity in a spiral fashion. Using a spiral intensity profile can also perform segmentation at different scales from cancer regions to nuclei cluster to individual nuclei. We compared our algorithm with manually segmented image and obtained a specificity of 83.7% and sensitivity of 61.1%. Spiral intensity profiles can be used as a feature to improve other segmentation algorithms.

Comparision of sol-gel and sputtering method properties of TiO2 thin film ultraviolet sensor,"The objective of this paper is to realize a UV sensor with an Al/TiO2/ITO structure and the high quality TiO2 thin films were grown on ITO substrates prepared by sputtering and the sol-gel method at 300degC. The proposed UV device adopted metal semiconductor metal (MSM) light-dependent resistor has characteristics of varying film thickness, and high photo-electric and stability. The photo-electric measurements show that thin film thickness could remarkably influence the photo-electric properties of the TiO2 electrodes. In the sputtering method, film is produced 300 nm with high quality crystal and strong photoelectric activity, showing the largest photo-current. With the sol-gel method, film is produced at 50 nm showing the largest photo-current. The UV photo response of sputtered TiO2 film and sol-gel TiO2 film were about 0.14 mAW-1 and 0.06 mAW-1 respectively. In this study, the crystal quality, optical and electrical properties of these high quality TiO2 thin films were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical absorption and I-V measurements.",Sputtering;Optical films;Thin film sensors;Indium tin oxide;Semiconductor thin films;Semiconductor films;Electron optics;Optical sensors;Optical microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,"SENSORS, 2008 IEEE",10.1109/ICSENS.2008.4716446
Fabrication of a reflective mirror within wide incidence angles for mid-infrared wavelength,"One-dimensional (1-D) photonic crystal with photonic band-gap based on porous silicon is fabricated with alternative etching currents during anodization. The microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the optical reflectance spectra by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A band-gap centered at 6 microns with a bandwidth of 3 microns has been successfully obtained. The prepared multilayer structure can reflect mid-infrared within a wide incidence angle up to 50deg. After proper oxidation process, its thermal properties can be improved significantly, and meanwhile the band-gap only slightly shifts to that centered at 5.7 microns.

Clustering initiated multiphase active contours and robust separation of nuclei groups for tissue segmentation,"Computer assisted or automated histological grading of tissue biopsies for clinical cancer care is a long-studied but challenging problem. It requires sophisticated algorithms for image segmentation, tissue architecture characterization, global texture feature extraction, and high-dimensional clustering and classification algorithms. Currently there are no automatic image-based grading systems for quantitative pathology of cancer tissues. We describe a novel approach for tissue segmentation using fuzzy spatial clustering, vector-based multiphase level set active contours and nuclei detection using an iterative kernel voting scheme that is robust even in the case of clumped touching nuclei. Early results show that we can reach a 91% detection rate compared to manual ground truth of cell nuclei centers across a range of prostate cancer grades.",Active contours;Robustness;Image segmentation;Cancer;Clustering algorithms;Biopsy;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Iterative algorithms,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition,10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761744

In this context, we have developed an automated framework comprising robust cell segmentation using coupled shape-constrained active contours and efficient endosome extraction using an isotropic undecimated wavelet transform.

Atomic force microscopy probing for biomechanical characterization of living cells,"The mechanical characterization of cells is important in understanding cellular behavior. A micro-robotic system such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be adapted to measure the mechanical behaviors of cells due to its high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. AFM probing experiments on cells were performed with conical tips and sphere-particle-attached tips; the results were analyzed to characterize the mechanical properties of cells. We developed novel finite element (FE) models that include the topological information of cells and AFM tips. We applied these models and a conventional linear elastic model, the Hertz-Sneddon model, to the cell response analysis. Our analysis showed that the conventional linear elastic model has limitations in analyzing large deformations resulting from the substrate. The FE model can accurately estimate the mechanical properties of cells with property coherences, regardless of the geometric effects.

Study of surface roughness of CsI:Tl crystals treated by various abrasives,"The study of the surface roughness of CsI:Tl scintillators processed by abrasives with different grain size was performed to obtain the optical characteristics that are important for simulation of light collection processes in scintillators. The degree of roughness of the surface was studied qualitatively by optical microscopy and quantitatively by measuring light scattering indicatrices at different angles of incident light on the samples. Micrographs of the sample surfaces, obtained by means of optical microscopy, allowed the estimation of the typical roughness for each abrasive. The micro-facet slope distribution functions were extracted from the measured light scattering indicatrices. It was found that these functions depend only on the grain size of abrasive. For the same abrasive, the micro-facet slope distribution functions do not depend on the incident light angle which is a good demonstration of the reliability of the results. Micro-facet slope distributions obtained for CsI:Tl can be used for the simulation of light collection processes in different scintillators with similar hardness and elastic properties.",Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface treatment;Crystals;Abrasives;Optical microscopy;Grain size;Optical scattering;Light scattering;Distribution functions,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record,10.1109/NSSMIC.2008.4774601

Microstructure and mechanical properties of Sn-Ag-xNi composite solder,"SnPb solder joints are an essential part for microelectronic packages manufacturing industrial for a long time. In recent year, environmental concerns and RoHS (Restriction of Use of Hazardous Substances) has demanded elimination of lead from electronics products by July 1, 2006. However, base on increasing pressures to achieve environmentally friendly electronic materials and processes, and indeed, growing governmental regulations around the word, the drive is strong to use lead-free solders in electronic assemblies. Among the various lead-free solder alloys, eutectic Sn-Ag solder has attracted particular interest. Composite solders offer improved the mechanical property as compared to non-composite solder. Ni reinforcement particles were incorporated to the Sn-Ag solder paste to formed composite solder. In this study, composite solders were prepared by mechanically added Ni reinforcement particles with 0.5, 1, and 3 wt% into the Sn- Ag solder paste were studies. The microstructure of Sn-Ag-xNi composite solder alloy and with Cu substrate joints were evaluated by means of optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD peaks of Sn-Ag-xNi were observed for different x values of Ni concentration. That shows the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the prepared Sn-Ag-xNi solder, indicating that the Ag3Sn and a few Ni3Sn4 were random mixed with the Sn-3.5Ag solder. The microstructure of Ni reinforcement addition will suppress the beta-Sn grain coarsened and an intermetallic compound of (Ni,Cu) 3Sn4 particle was dispersed throughout the eutectic matrix. The reaction between the molten composite solder and Cu substrate resulted in the formation of two IMCs, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the interface and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 in the matrix and nearby interface of solder joints. Additionally, the intermetallic compound layer of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound will be thickened with increasing Ni content. The top morphology of IMCs was also characterized after the solder was selectively etched away. The IMCs on the Sn-Ag-xNi/Cu showed long rod-like shape. The experimental results reveal that the addition small amount of Ni reinforcement particles to the molten Sn-Ag solder will increase the tensile strength in the as-soldered specimens. For Ni added less than 1 wt% that presence of dimple-like structure on the fracture surfaces in the solder matrix which is suggested a ductile failure mode. For Ni additions exceed 1 wt%, the failure mode changes from ductile fracture to brittle fracture, and the specimens fail adjacent the interface of the solder matrix and the IMC layer.",Microstructure;Mechanical factors;Optical microscopy;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Lead;Scanning electron microscopy;Soldering;X-ray diffraction;Optical diffraction;X-ray scattering,INPROCEEDINGS,2008,2008 International Conference on Electronic Materials and Packaging,10.1109/EMAP.2008.4784257

A Novel Cell Segmentation Method and Cell Phase Identification Using Markov Model,"Optical microscopy is becoming an important technique in drug discovery and life science research. The approaches used to analyze optical microscopy images are generally classified into two categories: automatic and manual approaches. However, the existing automatic systems are rather limited in dealing with large volume of time-lapse microscopy images because of the complexity of cell behaviors and morphological variance. On the other hand, manual approaches are very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an effective automated, quantitative analysis system that can be used to segment, track, and quantize cell cycle behaviors of a large population of cells nuclei effectively and efficiently. We use adaptive thresholding and watershed algorithm for cell nuclei segmentation followed by a fragment merging method that combines two scoring models based on trend and no trend features. Using the context information of time-lapse data, the phases of cell nuclei are identified accurately via a Markov model. Experimental results show that the proposed system is effective for nuclei segmentation and phase identification.",Image segmentation;Bioinformatics;Biomedical imaging;Image analysis;Merging;Hospitals;Drugs;Optical microscopy;Fluorescence;Radiology;Cell phase identification;continuous Markov model;nuclei segmentation;time-lapse fluorescence microscopy;tracking,ARTICLE,2009,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,10.1109/TITB.2008.2007098

Web-Based Multilayer Viewing Interface for Knee Cartilage,"Many adults suffer from osteoarthritis (OA) with the majority of people over 65 showing radiographic evidence of the disease. To carry out effective diagnosis and treatment, it is necessary to understand the progression of cartilage loss and study the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Hence, it is important to have accurate, fast diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, we describe a Web-based user interface that enables the direct viewing of 2-D and 3-D image data from the visceral and tissue levels of the biological continuum (i.e., the continuum comprising systems, viscera, tissue, cells, proteins, and genes)-while preserving geometric integrity. This is achieved despite the fact that the data are from different modalities (i.e., magnetic resonance (MR) and light microscopy). The user interface was tested using image data acquired from a study of articular cartilage thickness in the porcine knee. The interface allows the clinician to view both MR and light microscopy images in an integrated manner-with the information linked geometrically.",Nonhomogeneous media;Knee;Bone diseases;User interfaces;Biological tissues;Osteoarthritis;Diagnostic radiography;Viscera;Cells (biology);Proteins;Cartilage wear;multimodality;visualization interface,ARTICLE,2009,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,10.1109/TITB.2008.2007667
Automatic Classification for Pathological Prostate Images Based on Fractal Analysis,"Accurate grading for prostatic carcinoma in pathological images is important to prognosis and treatment planning. Since human grading is always time-consuming and subjective, this paper presents a computer-aided system to automatically grade pathological images according to Gleason grading system which is the most widespread method for histological grading of prostate tissues. We proposed two feature extraction methods based on fractal dimension to analyze variations of intensity and texture complexity in regions of interest. Each image can be classified into an appropriate grade by using Bayesian, k-NN, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, respectively. Leave-one-out and k-fold cross-validation procedures were used to estimate the correct classification rates (CCR). Experimental results show that 91.2%, 93.7%, and 93.7% CCR can be achieved by Bayesian, k-NN, and SVM classifiers, respectively, for a set of 205 pathological prostate images. If our fractal-based feature set is optimized by the sequential floating forward selection method, the CCR can be promoted up to 94.6%, 94.2%, and 94.6%, respectively, using each of the above three classifiers. Experimental results also show that our feature set is better than the feature sets extracted from multiwavelets, Gabor filters, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix methods because it has a much smaller size and still keeps the most powerful discriminating capability in grading prostate images.",Pathology;Fractals;Image analysis;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Feature extraction;Bayesian methods;Path planning;Humans;Image texture analysis;Classification;fractal dimension;Gleason grading;prostatic carcinoma;prostate image,ARTICLE,2009,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2009.2012704
Automated Quantitative Assessment of HER-2/neu Immunohistochemical Expression in Breast Cancer,"The expression of the HER-2/neu (HER2) gene, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, has been shown to be a valuable prognostic indicator for breast cancer. However, interobserver variability has been reported in the evaluation of HER2 with immunohistochemistry. It has been suggested that automated computer-based evaluation can provide a consistent and objective evaluation of HER2 expression. In this manuscript, we present an automated method for the quantitative assessment of HER2 using digital microscopy. The method processes microscopy images from tissue slides with a multistage algorithm, including steps of color pixel classification, nuclei segmentation, and cell membrane modeling, and extracts quantitative, continuous measures of cell membrane staining intensity and completeness. A minimum cluster distance classifier merges the features to classify the slides into HER2 categories. An evaluation based on agreement analysis with pathologist-derived HER2 scores, showed good agreement with the provided truth. Agreement varied within the different classes with highest agreement (up to 90%) for positive (3+) slides, and lowest agreement (72%-78%) for equivocal (2+) slides which contained ambiguous scoring. The developed automated method has the potential to be used as a computer aid for the immunohistochemical evaluation of HER2 expression with the objective of increasing observer reproducibility.",Breast cancer;Microscopy;Cells (biology);Biomembranes;Epidermis;Clustering algorithms;Color;Pixel;Image segmentation;Nuclear measurements;Biomarker;breast cancer;computer-aided immunohistochemistry;digital microscopy;HER2/neu;pathology,ARTICLE,2009,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2009.2012901
Assisted Diagnosis of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN),"This paper introduces an automated computer- assisted system for the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) using ultra-large cervical histological digital slides. The system contains two parts: the segmentation of squamous epithelium and the diagnosis of CIN. For the segmentation, to reduce processing time, a multiresolution method is developed. The squamous epithelium layer is first segmented at a low (2X) resolution. The boundaries are further fine tuned at a higher (20X) resolution. The block-based segmentation method uses robust texture feature vectors in combination with support vector machines (SVMs) to perform classification. Medical rules are finally applied. In testing, segmentation using 31 digital slides achieves 94.25% accuracy. For the diagnosis of CIN, changes in nuclei structure and morphology along lines perpendicular to the main axis of the squamous epithelium are quantified and classified. Using multi-category SVM, perpendicular lines are classified into Normal, CIN I, CIN II, and CIN III. The robustness of the system in term of regional diagnosis is measured against pathologists' diagnoses and inter-observer variability between two pathologists is considered. Initial results suggest that the system has potential as a tool both to assist in pathologists' diagnoses, and in training.",Neoplasms;Cancer;Pathology;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Support vector machines;Robustness;Support vector machine classification;Microscopy;Signal resolution;Cervical cancer;CIN;diagnosis;digital pathology;digital slide;image processing;SVM,ARTICLE,2009,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing,10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2011157
Blind Decomposition of Transmission Light Microscopic Hyperspectral Cube Using Sparse Representation,"In this paper, we address the problem of fully automated decomposition of hyperspectral images for transmission light microscopy. The hyperspectral images are decomposed into spectrally homogeneous compounds. The resulting compounds are described by their spectral characteristics and optical density. We present the multiplicative physical model of image formation in transmission light microscopy, justify reduction of a hyperspectral image decomposition problem to a blind source separation problem, and provide method for hyperspectral restoration of separated compounds. In our approach, dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) is followed by a blind source separation (BSS) algorithm. The BSS method is based on sparsifying transformation of observed images and relative Newton optimization procedure. The presented method was verified on hyperspectral images of biological tissues. The method was compared to the existing approach based on nonnegative matrix factorization. Experiments showed that the presented method is faster and better separates the biological compounds from imaging artifacts.

Synthesis of Polystyrene Thin Films by Means of an Atmospheric-Pressure Plasma Torch and a Dielectric Barrier Discharge,"In this paper, the deposition and characterization of plasma-polymerized polystyrene (pp-PS) using PECVD under atmospheric pressure on a variety of substrates was investigated. An atmospheric RF plasma torch and an HF dielectric-barrier-discharge (DBD) system were used to deposit thin pp-PS coatings on PTFE, HDPE, stainless steel, glass, and silicon wafer. The styrene vapor was carried by Ar or He. The pp-PS films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), water contact angle (WCA), static secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SSIMS), and optical microscopy, and the plasma phase was studied by optical-emission spectroscopy. The major features that characterize PS are present in the FTIR, SSIMS, and XPS spectra of our films, although some differences are observed between pp-PS and their conventionally polymerized counterparts: oxygenation, branching, degree of cross-linking, and unsaturation. According to the WCA and XPS results, the films deposited by the RF plasma torch (placed in a Plexiglass chamber) are more oxygenated than those deposited by DBD, which is operated under a much more controlled atmosphere. A comparison of the chemical structure of the deposited coatings (branching, cross-linking) as a function of the nature of the carrier gas was established by FTIR: pp-PS synthesized in the presence of Ar (for both processes) exhibit more branching and a higher degree of cross-linking than pp-PS synthesized with He as the main plasma gas. The optical microscopy points out a diversity of structures that depend on the nature of the substrate and the plasma parameters.",Dielectric thin films;Atmospheric-pressure plasmas;Optical films;Mass spectroscopy;Optical microscopy;Dielectric substrates;Infrared spectra;Radio frequency;Plasma x-ray sources;Coatings;Plasma CVD;plasma materials-processing applications;plasmas;plastics,ARTICLE,2009,IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science,10.1109/TPS.2009.2014165
"Study on HepG-2 apoptosis induced by saponins isolated from asparagus and the effects on the activities of Caspase-3,8,9","To study the effect of saponins of asparagus on apoptosis and the variations of Caspase-8, 9, 3 activity in the process of asparagus induced apoptosis in HepG-2. Cell was administrated with different concentrations of asparagus at different time, the apoptosis rate was determined by FCM with AV-PI staining, the morphology was observed by electron microscopy, caspase-8,9,3 activities was measured by kit. Experiments showed that saponins of asparagus inhibited cell growth. At 72 h, the apoptosis rate increased with concentrations markedly. Apoptotic morphology was observed. After Asparagus officinalis saponin of different concentrations have been acting on HepG-2 cells for 24 h and 48 h, the activity of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 was significantly increased compared with that in the negative control, which suggesting that the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells by Asparagus officinalis saponin may be related to its activating caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3. From the experimental results, it can also be seen that the activity of Caspase-8 is high at 24 h, and the activities of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 is high at 48 h, which suggesting that, in inducing apoptosis in HepG-2 cells, Asparagus officinalis saponin first activates the starter caspases, or caspase-8 and caspase-9, and the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in turn leads to the caspase cascade, resulting in the activation of caspase-3. As an executor caspase, caspase-3 eventually leads to cell apoptosis.",Business;Electronic equipment testing;Biological materials;Biomedical materials;Conducting materials;Cells (biology);Helium;Morphology;Humans;Cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering,10.1109/ICCME.2009.4906584
Optical Fourier processing microscope to quantify subcellular structure and dynamics,"Fundamental biological processes, such as cell death, involve time-dependent dynamic alterations in the morphology and organization of organelles. Since organelles are at the limit of optical image resolution, electron microscopy (EM) remains the method of choice to assess subcellular structure. However, sample fixation precludes analysis of time dependent processes within the same specimen with EM, and the use of high magnification with nanoscale resolution often results in the analysis of a few limited fields of view. To address these limitations and assess morphological change over large fields of view with sub-wavelength sensitivity in unstained living cells, we demonstrate a microscope for optical processing with high spatial frequency resolution. We use a digital micromirror device as a Fourier spatial filter to implement two-dimensional Gabor-like filters that can characterize particle size, orientation and aspect ratio. Quantitative object maps that encode these local morphological parameters are generated. We demonstrate the nanoscale sensitivity of this technique to object structure using periodic phase masks and spheres, and show how the size, aspect ratio and orientation of finite objects may be assessed in situ with our approach. In contrast to digital image processing, the sensitivity of our method to local morphological change is determined by frequency resolution in the Fourier plane, and is gained through a trade-off with spatial resolution in the image, therefore making it independent of image blurring or camera pixel size. Applications include rapid throughput analysis of non-spherical scatterers, such as mitochondria, within living cells.",Optical microscopy;Optical filters;Optical scattering;Spatial resolution;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical sensors;Electron optics;Image resolution;Nanobioscience;Frequency,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering,10.1109/ICCME.2009.4906681
Simultaneous morphology and molecular imaging of colon cancer,"The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of imaging colon cancers using multi-modal optical imaging system combining optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI). This system enables simultaneous imaging of tissue morphology and molecular information at high resolution (10-20 mum) over a 3-5 mm field-of-view.

Compressive confocal microscopy,"In this paper, a new framework for confocal microscopy based on the novel theory of compressive sensing is proposed. Unlike wide field microscopy or conventional parallel beam confocal imaging systems that use charge-coupled devices (CCD) as acquisition devices in addition to complex mechanical scanning system, the proposed compressive confocal microscopy is a kind of parallel beam confocal imaging system which exploits the rich theory of compressive sensing by using a single pixel detector and a digital micromirror device (DMD) to capture linear projections of the in-focus image. With the proposed system, confocal imaging of high optical sectioning ability can be achieved at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. Theoretical analysis, simulations and experimental results are shown to demonstrate the characteristics and potential of the proposed approach.",Image coding;Optical imaging;Optical microscopy;Image sampling;Pixel;Optical sensors;Detectors;Image reconstruction;Micromirrors;Biomedical optical imaging;confocal imaging;compressive sensing;programmable array microscopy;SBHE;DMD,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,"2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing",10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959612
Nanoshell build-up onto non-fixed human red blood cells through the layer-by-layer self-assembly technique for their immunocamouflage,"In this study, non-fixed red blood cells (RBCs) were coated with a polymeric shell via the layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique for their potential application in medical blood transfusion. The polymeric shell is achieved through the alternate adsorption of two oppositely charged polymers; chitosan-graft-phosphorylcholine (CH-PC) and alginate (ALG). The process of film formation was followed by measuring the zeta potential revealing a charge alternation upon the addition of the polyelectrolytes. The integrity of the coated RBCs was assessed with optical microscopy demonstrating similar shapes to uncoated RBCs. Moreover, the percentage of released hemoglobin and adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) in the supernatant were measured and compared to the non-coated RBCs. The results showed that the layers built on the RBCs demonstrated no changes in cellular morphology and integrity. Most importantly, an agglutination test was performed to assess antibodies interaction with coated RBCs. They showed no aggregation suggesting a decrease in antibody recognition of coated RBCs. In summary, a system of two different polymers is successfully able to protect the cells from hemolysis and prevent recognition by the antibodies. This would offer a great opportunity for producing universal RBCs.",Humans;Red blood cells;Self-assembly;Immune system;Optical films;Optical microscopy;Polymer films;Current measurement;Charge measurement;Biomedical optical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE 35th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference,10.1109/NEBC.2009.4967675
A novel overlapping mice macrophages images segmentation method,"Aiming at the overlapping phenomenon that exists among the cells in the actual mice macrophages image, this paper presents the method of image segmentation based on Otsu threshold and watershed of distance transform. The image is first segmented by Otsu threshold algorithm. Then erosion and dilation morphological operators are used to get rid of noises. Finally, the watershed algorithm based on distance transform is carried out to segment the image.

Keynote lecture 5: “Cellular dynamism during force propagation revealed by live cell interferometry”,"Cancer and many other diseases are characterized by changes in cell morphology, motion and mechanical rigidity. However, in live-cell-cytology stimulus-induced morphologic changes typically take 10–30 minutes to detect. Here, we employ live-cell-interferometry (LCI) to visualize the instantaneous response of a whole cell to mechanical stimulation, and we detect cytoskeletal remodeling behavior within 200 seconds. This behavior involved small, rapid changes in cell content and miniscule changes in shape, which would be difficult to detect with conventional or phase contrast microscopy alone, and is beyond the dynamic capability of AFM. We demonstrate that LCI provides a rapid, quantitative reconstruction of the cell body with no labeling that is highly complementary to traditional microscopy and flow cytometry, which require cell surface marker detection and/or destructive cell fixation for labeling.",Pathology;Pediatrics;Biochemistry;Cancer;Immune system;Hospitals;Atomic force microscopy;Labeling;Systems engineering and theory;Interferometry,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 4th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems,10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068785
The histological grading of HCC using fusion images,"The histological grading of Hepatocellular Carcinoma is essential to prognosis and treatment planning. Providing a quantitative analysis by machine vision is desired for a determination of the grading result. However, the cells on the biopsy are not all in the some depth of focus under the microscope. Some cells in the images captured by machine may become a blur with a small variance of focus. These cells may not be segmented from images or segmented into a undesized shape and thus affect the grading results. Consequently, an ldquoall-in-focus imagerdquo is very useful to the grading of Hepatocellular Carcinoma performed by the machine. In this paper, we proposed an image fusion approach based on the wavelet-based focus measure to fuse two images with different depth of focus into one image, which contains much more in-depth focus cells. In our experiments, we demonstrated that the fused images not only provide clear appearance of cells but also higher accuracy of grading than original images.",Focusing;Microscopy;Image analysis;Biopsy;Shape;Pathology;Image segmentation;Image fusion;Fuses;Computational intelligence;HCC biopsy image;image fusion;HCC grading;focus measure,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications,10.1109/CIMSA.2009.5069944
The influence of the Pb-free solder alloy composition and processing parameters on thermal fatigue performance of a ceramic chip resistor,"This paper presents the results of a thermal fatigue study of a 2512 ceramic chip resistor assembled with various Pb free solders including SnCu, SAC105, SAC205, SAC305, and SAC405. The test matrix also includes some limited evaluations with other variables such as cooling rate (solidification rate), thermal preconditioning and nitrogen (inert) reflow atmosphere. The matrix also includes a SnPb eutectic control cells. The resistor test vehicle provides an expedient and self-consistent method for evaluating the relative fatigue performance of the various alloys. A study of the as-assembled solder joints was conducted to characterize the microstructure of the solder joints with varying silver content. Thermal fatigue was evaluated using an accelerated temperature cycle of 0/100degC with dwell times of 10 and 60 minutes. The test results show a direct relationship between characteristic fatigue life and Ag content, with the higher Ag content alloys outperforming those with the lowest Ag content. As might be anticipated, there also was a consistent inverse relationship between fatigue life and dwell time for the Pb free solders. The failure analysis and microstructural evolution is characterized with optical metallography and scanning electron microscopy and the fatigue reliability of the Pb free solders is discussed in terms of the microstructures.",Thermal resistance;Fatigue;Ceramics;Resistors;Soldering;Microstructure;Optical microscopy;Assembly;Testing;Cooling,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 59th Electronic Components and Technology Conference,10.1109/ECTC.2009.5074048
Segmentation of the effective area of images of renal biopsy samples,"Diagnosis and monitoring of kidney diseases and transplants is supported by microscopic analysis of needle-core biopsy samples. The current methods of analysis allow for inconsistencies, bias, and inaccuracies. We propose image processing methods for automatic segmentation of the effective biopsy area (cortex and medulla) from digital images of renal biopsy samples. The methods include opening-by-reconstruction, a morphological closing operation, and morphological erosion. The results are compared to 100 randomly selected images manually marked by an experienced renal pathologist. Comparative measures indicate that the automatically detected region of interest closely matches the ground truth; the mean distance to the closest point was 5.46 plusmn 3.92 mum (6 plusmn 4.31 pixels) and the true-positive fraction was 98.25 plusmn 1.77%.",Image segmentation;Biopsy;Microscopy;Gray-scale;Medical treatment;Digital images;Monitoring;Diseases;Pixel;Surgery;needle-core renal biopsy;histopathology;image segmentation;opening-by-reconstruction,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering,10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090101
Mathematical analysis of colon glands for cancer diagnosis,"Neoplastic diseases including cancer cause organizational changes in tissues. Histopathological examination, which is routinely used for the diagnosis and grading of these diseases, relies on pathologists to identify such tissue changes under a microscope. However, as this examination mainly relies on the visual interpretation of pathologists, it may lead to a considerable amount of subjectivity. To reduce the subjectivity level, it is proposed to use computational methods that provide objective measures. These methods quantify the tissue changes associated with disease by defining features on tissue images. In this paper, colon glands are mathematically analyzed making use of different feature extraction approaches. In this analysis, morphological, intensity-based, and textural features are investigated and glands are classified using these features. Working on the images of 108 colon tissues of 36 patients, our experiments demonstrate that this classification leads to promising results for differentiating normal glands from the cancerous ones.",Cancer;Mathematical analysis;Colon;Glands;Diseases;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Image texture analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE 17th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference,10.1109/SIU.2009.5136462
Preliminary results of cell image segmentation using dynamic force estimation on a static vane,"This paper presents a novel method for cell image segmentation. The approach is based on the application of dynamic force estimation on a static vane (DFESV) to medical image processing problems. The other processes in the approach include smoothing filter using anisotropic diffusion, thresholding using Otsu's algorithm, morphology operation, marking boundary segment, angle image operator, and angle relation merging. Microscopic images from breast cancer tissue are used for evaluation of the approach.

Acoustic imaging of thick biological tissue,"Up to now, biomedical imaging with ultrasound for observing a cellular tissue structure has been limited to very thinly sliced tissue at very high ultrasonic frequencies, i.e., 1 GHz. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic study to use a 150 to 200 MHz frequency range for thickly sliced biological tissue. A mechanical scanning reflection acoustic microscope (SAM) was used for obtaining horizontal cross-sectional images (C-scans) showing cellular structures. In the study, sectioned specimens of human breast cancer and tissues from the small intestine were prepared and examined. Some accessories for biomedical application were integrated into our SAM (Sonix HS-1000 and Olympus UH-3), which operated in pulse-wave and tone-burst wave modes, respectively. We found that the frequency 100 to 200 MHz provides optimal balance between resolution and penetration depth for examining the thickly sliced specimens. The images obtained with the lens focused at different depths revealed cellular structures whose morphology was very similar to that seen in the thinly sectioned specimens with optical and scanning acoustic microscopy. The SAM operation in the pulse-echo mode permits the imaging of tissue structure at the surface, and it also opens up the potential for attenuation imaging representing reflection from the substrate behind the thick specimen. We present such images of breast cancer proving the method's applicability to overall tumor detection. SAM with a high-frequency tone-burst ultrasonic wave reveals details of tissue structure, and both methods may serve as additional diagnostic tools in a hospital environment.",Acoustic imaging;Biological tissues;Ultrasonic imaging;Frequency;Optical reflection;Acoustic reflection;Breast cancer;Optical attenuators;Optical microscopy;Optical imaging,ARTICLE,2009,"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control",10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1191
Observations and models for needle-tissue interactions,"The asymmetry of a bevel-tip needle results in the needle naturally bending when it is inserted into soft tissue. In this study we present a mechanics-based model that calculates the deflection of the needle embedded in an elastic medium. Microscopic observations for several needle-gel interactions were used to characterize the interactions at the bevel tip and along the needle shaft. The model design was guided by microscopic observations of several needle-gel interactions. The energy-based model formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters such as rupture toughness, nonlinear material elasticity, and interaction stiffness, and needle geometric and material properties. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in macroscopic experimental studies of a robot-driven needle interacting with different kinds of gels.

Bioreactivity of Beijing Outdoor Ambient Particulates,"Ambient particulates play an important role in human health; numerous studies have related ambient particulates levels with adverse health outcomes, primarily respiratory-related, in the general population. The health effect is closely correlated with properties of ambient particulates, toxicology mechanism is studied on the molecular level by means of molecular biology method mostly, the vitro plasmid assay together with FESEM (Field emission scanning electron microscopy) and ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) were employed to investigate the physico-chemical characteristics and the bioreactivity of ambient particulates in Beijing air. It was found that the TD20 (toxic dose of particulate matter causing 20% of plasmid DNA damage) of Beijing ambient particulates can be as low as 28 mug.m-1 and as high as >1000 mug.m-1.

Coarse-to-Fine Particle Segmentation in Microscopic Urinary Images,"This paper presents a coarse-to-fine particle segmentation strategy to extract particles from microscopic urinary images within two stages, coarse stage and fine stage. In coarse stage, to locate particles in a wide range of images including the low contrast, the unevenly illuminated, etc, we develop 4-direction variance mapping followed by an adaptive thresholding method. Within this stage, particles are well located, but their contours fail to exactly represent their shapes and clumped particle clusters are not divided. In fine stage, combined with Canny edges, we extract desired particle contours, then an effective local maxima search algorithm based on distance map successfully separates clumped particle clusters into individual particles. Our strategy is easy for implementation and its effectiveness is verified by large-scale experiments.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Clustering algorithms;Cells (biology);Image edge detection;Lighting;Blood;Level set;Morphology;Shape,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162520

The growth index of spleen and bursa of Fabricius were detected and the structures of them were observed by optical microscope and transmission electron microscope. The results showed that (1) the growth index of spleen and bursa of Fabricius of aluminum toxical group was significant lower than the control group in chickens (P<0.01) and the growth index had dose-effect relationships with AlCl3.

Spleen presented changes of apoptotic morphology and germinal center of bursal nodule hyperplasyed in high dose group. (3) In the fact of ultrastructurally, low dose group had no apparently pathological changes. In middle and high dose groups, karyolemma broken, mitochondria swelled, cristae fragmentated or disappeared, rough endoplasmic reticulum dilated, cisternas widen, confluenced vacuole and presented typical mark shape of apoptosis in lymphocyte of spleen; karyolemma broken, caryolysised, myelin bodys appeared, the number of organelles within intracytoplasm decreased significantly in lymphocyte of bursa of Fabricius.

Mathematical Morphology Based Enhancement for Chromosome Images,"Chromosome images were acquired by microscopic imaging of metaphase or prophase cells on specimen slides. Digitized chromosome images usually suffer from poor image quality, particularly lack of contrast and presence of shading and artifacts. So these images must be enhanced. This paper presented an enhancement algorithm for chromosome images based on mathematical morphology. Firstly, the top-hat transform and bot-hat transform were used to improve the contrast of the images. Then, the iterative threshold segment, closing operation and opening operation were operated on the result respectively. The final result was obtained by the and operation being operated on the two results. To validate the effect of this algorithm, the Canny edge detection operator was used to detect the edges of chromosomes in the original images and those being enhanced by this algorithm respectively. The experiment proved that the algorithm can improve the contrast of the image effectively and also can remove noise of the image.",Morphology;Biological cells;Iterative algorithms;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Pixel;Microscopy;Cells (biology);Image quality;Data analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5163030
Normobaric Hypoxia-induced Brain Damage and Mechanism in Wistar Rat,"To evaluate normobaric hypoxia-induced brain damage and discuss the mechanism in wistar rat brain injury, the water content of brain , brain infarction area ratio , the level of lactic acid and Na+-K+-ATPase activity were detected. The expression of HIF-lalpha was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. Histopathological changes of brain in rat model due to hypoxia were investigated using hematoxylin and eosin stain (HE). Results showed that the levels of lactic acid were positively correlated with the degree of hypoxia which caused a concentration-dependent decrease in total Na+-K+- ATPase activity. Compared with the control group, brain water content of rat model had significant difference under serious hypoxia condition. Brain infarction ratio increased sharply when lactic acid level increased and Na+-K+-ATPase activity decreased obviously. Histopathological examination confirmed that there was a necrotic feature in one single hippocampal gyrus neuron cell. HIF-lalpha (hypoxia induced factor-lalpha) was induced by hypoxia at 6% 02. Expression of HIF-lalpha enhanced the hypoxia adaptation capability of the rat model through regulating the expression of multiple genes.

Studies on Inhibition of Juglone on Sarcoma 180 in Mice,"To study the anti-tumor effect and mechanism of juglone on the mice xenotransplant model of sarcoma 180 in vivo. S180 tumor-bearing mice were set up to investigate the effects of juglone on tumor growth. After HE staining, the pathomorphologic changes of tumor cells were observed by optical microscope. The ultrastructural changes of tumor cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to observe the apoptosis rate and cell cycle arrest in S180 cells. The experimental results showed that the tumor inhibition rate at the dosage of 2, 4 and 8 mumol/kg of juglone was 29.04%, 37.33%, 52.66% respectively. The tumor weight of all dose groups of juglone were lower significantly than that in blank control group (P<0.01). Under the optical microscope, the necrosis degree of the tumor cells increased significantly as the concentration of juglone increased compared with the blank control group. The typical morphological changes of apoptosis were observed, such as chromatin condensation, margination against nuclear envelope and formation of apoptotic bodies by transmission electron microscopy. The subdiploid peak was found and the apoptosis rate of juglone at the dosage of 2, 4 and 8 mumol/kg was 5.58plusmn0.63%, 6.66plusmn0.85%, 10.27plusmn1.05% respectively. The percentage of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle was decreased, whereas the amount of cells in the G2/M phase was increased.

An integrated approach of particle swarm optimization and support vector machine for gene signature selection and cancer prediction,"To improve cancer diagnosis and drug development, the classification of tumor types based on genomic information is important. As DNA microarray studies produce a large amount of data, expression data are highly redundant and noisy, and most genes are believed to be uninformative with respect to the studied classes. Only a fraction of genes may present distinct profiles for different classes of samples. Classification tools to deal with these issues are thus important. These tools should learn to robustly identify a subset of informative genes embedded in a large dataset that is contaminated with high dimensional noises. In this paper, an integrated approach of support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for this purpose. The proposed approach can simultaneously optimize the selection of feature subset and the classifier through a common solution coding mechanism. As an illustration, the proposed approach is applied to search the combinational gene signatures for predicting histologic response to chemotherapy of osteosarcoma patients. Cross-validation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods in terms of classification accuracy. Further validation using an independent dataset shows misclassification of only one out of fourteen patient samples, suggesting that the selected gene signatures can reflect the chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.",Particle swarm optimization;Support vector machines;Cancer;Support vector machine classification;Drugs;Neoplasms;Genomics;Bioinformatics;DNA;Noise robustness,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178827
Self organizing maps for class discovery in the quantitative colocalization analysis feature space,"Quantitative colocalization analysis in fluorescent microscopy imaging is a promising procedure used to perform functional protein analysis.

Second, we use the PCA/KLT to un-correlate the data in the hyperplane; and Third, SOM network is trained to find and visualize the clusters (classes) in the data.

Micro demultiplexer fabricated by self-assembly of microspheres on a patterned substrate,"To demonstrate light-path manipulation in arbitrary shapes, we fabricated coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) having a 90deg-corner structure on a lithographically patterned substrate using a simple self-organization process. The spectra of propagation light within the CROWs were directly measured by guide-collection-mode near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) techniques. The spectra revealed that the propagation light through the CROWs has a larger relative intensity of transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization mode than that of transverse-electric (TE) one, whereas Mie theory predicts the intensities of both to be nearly equal. The most plausible cause of the lower intensity in the TE modes is that light leaks out to, and is absorbed by, the patterned Si substrate, because the observable TE light in our setup goes around the microspheres in the vertical plane.",Self-assembly;Optical resonators;Optical waveguides;Optical refraction;Optical variables control;Optical propagation;High speed optical techniques;Optical coupling;Optical microscopy;Wiring;Whispering-gallery modes;CROWs;microsphere;self-assembly;NSOM;patterned substrate,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks,10.1109/ICTON.2009.5185158

Superfocusing on a dielectric-metal-dielectric apertureless scanning near-field optical microscope probe,Scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) is an important tool for measurements of nanostructures as well as chemical and biosensing applications. A key parameter defining its usefulness is its resolution which depends of the geometrical size of SNOM probes and signal throughput in aperture tips and signal enhancement in apertureless ones. We analyse nanofocusing properties of an apertureless probe in the form of a dielectric tapered fiber with metal apertureless coating and a novel dielectric nanocladding. The new outer nanocladding gives an ability to tune resonant enhancement wavelengths within a wide spectral range by choice of cladding permittivity. The investigation is performed using body-of-revolution finite-difference time-domain simulations. A silica core of diameter decreasing from 2 mum to 5 nm at the apex is covered with a 40 nm thick Ag layer and has a 5 nm dielectric cladding. Internal illumination with a radially polarized Laguerre-Gauss beam guided in fiber is used. We find that with an increase of the refractive index of nanocladdings the maximum enhancement occurs for increasingly longer wavelengths.,Optical microscopy;Probes;Biomedical optical imaging;Geometrical optics;Optical refraction;Optical variables control;Optical fiber polarization;Dielectric measurements;Nanostructures;Chemicals;SNOM;surface plasmon;plasmonics;FDTD;apertureless SNOM probes,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 11th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks,10.1109/ICTON.2009.5185070
Investigation of micrometre scale parabolic mirrors for use as single atom quantum registers,"Arrays of refractive microlenses, with diameters on the order of hundreds of micrometres, have been the subject of much research in the applied physics community. Recently, arrays of optical dipole traps, with 50 mum separation, each containing on the order of 100 laser cooled atoms, have been created. This state-of- the-art experiment, combining microfabrication and atom physics, has been proposed as the basis for a quantum simulator. Refractive microscopic elements are constrained by certain limitations that will hinder their development to smaller scales. This paper presents engineered, reflective, parabolic micromirrors, with diameters of 10 mum, that provide many of the features of microlenses but simultaneously circumvent chromatic and spherical aberrations as well as scaling issues of the lens arrays. Optical interrogation of the focal plane of the mirror array is achieved using a modified confocal microscope.

Specifically, the marker is switched between a bright and a dark state (on or off) to detect the emission of adjacent features sequentially in time. The first viable concept of this kind was Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy where the diameter of the region (focal spot) in which the molecule can be in the fluorescent state follows d=lambda(2n sin alpharadic1+I/Is).I is the intensity that drives a fluorophore from the bright fluorescent state to the dark ground state by stimulated emission. Is depends (inversely) on the lifetime of the states. For I/Israrrinfin, it follows that drarr0, meaning that the resolution can be molecular . Altogether, far-field optical 'nanoscopy' is a fascinating development in optics with high relevance to the many areas of sciences, in particular the life sciences.",Stimulated emission;Biomedical optical imaging;Nanobioscience;Optical microscopy;Fluorescence;Optical diffraction;Image resolution;Chemistry;Apertures;Lenses,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,CLEO/Europe - EQEC 2009 - European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and the European Quantum Electronics Conference,10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2009.5191624
Balls hierarchy: Image segmentation by graph spanner,We propose a novel approach for solving the image segmentation and grouping problem. Our approach focuses on color and regional proximity relations in the image data. We treat image pixels as nodes in the graph so that proximity relations among both pixel's color and position are kept in geometric spanners. Geometric spanners for both color and position are created in hierarchical data structure so-called balls hierarchy. Balls hierarchy creates a multiresolution hierarchical subgraph that reflects a great deal about the original graph while maintaining all the existing proximity information in the image. We show that balls hierarchy can be used for image segmentation and grouping problems. We have applied our novel approach to several exemplary images such as histopathologic images and found results encouraging.,Image segmentation;Pixel;Data structures;Bismuth;Color;Kinetic theory;Computer science;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Image resolution;Image query system;image segmentation;graph spanner;balls hierarchy,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193097
Localizing the dermis/epidermis boundary in reflectance confocal microscopy images with a hybrid classification algorithm,"Confocal reflectance microscopy is an emerging modality, for dermatology applications, especially for in-situ and bedside detection of skin cancers. As this technology gains acceptance, automated processing methods become increasingly important to develop. Since the dominant internal feature of the skin is the epidermis/dermis boundary, it has been chosen as the initial target for this development. This boundary is a complex corrugated 3D layer marked by optically subtle changes and features. Indeed, even trained clinicians in an attempt at validation of our early work, were unable to precisely and reliably locate the boundary within optical resolution. Thus here we propose to detect two boundaries, a lower boundary for the epidermis and an upper boundary for the dermis thus trapping the epidermis/dermis boundary. We use a novel combined segmentation/classification approach applied to z-sequences of tiles in the 3D stack. The approach employs a sequential classification on texture features, selected via on-line feature selection, to minimize the labeling required and to cope with high inter- and intra-subject variability and low optical contrast. Initial results indicate the ability of our approach to find these two boundaries successfully for most of the z-sequences from the stack.",Dermis;Epidermis;Reflectivity;Microscopy;Classification algorithms;Skin;Image segmentation;Cancer;Surface morphology;Biomedical optical imaging;Confocal Microscopy;locally smooth SVM;sequence segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193308
Automatic markup of neural cell membranes using boosted decision stumps,"To better understand the central nervous system, neurobiologists need to reconstruct the underlying neural circuitry from electron microscopy images. One of the necessary tasks is to segment the individual neurons. For this purpose, we propose a supervised learning approach to detect the cell membranes. The classifier was trained using AdaBoost, on local and context features. The features were selected to highlight the line characteristics of cell membranes. It is shown that using features from context positions allows for more information to be utilized in the classification. Together with the nonlinear discrimination ability of the AdaBoost classifier, this results in clearly noticeable improvements over previously used methods.",Cells (biology);Biomembranes;Neurons;Image segmentation;Image reconstruction;Circuits;Transmission electron microscopy;Central nervous system;Electron microscopy;Machine learning algorithms;Serial-section TEM;cell membrane detection;AdaBoost;Segmentation;Machine Learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193233
Evaluation of level set-based histology image segmentation using geometric region criteria,"There is a great deal of interest in developing automated histological grading of tissue biopsies. Current approaches involve sophisticated algorithms for image segmentation, tissue architecture characterization, global texture feature extraction, and high-dimensional clustering and classification algorithms. Although overall image classification accuracy is measured, there has been very little attention paid to the quantitative assessment of the image segmentation stage (glandular structure characterization stage) to provide feedback to the segmentation process. We describe a robust approach for tissue segmentation combining spatial clustering with multiphase vector level set active contours to extract nuclei, lumen and epithelial cytoplasm.

Integrating multi-scale blob/curvilinear detector techniques and multi-level sets for automated segmentation of stem cell images,"Studies of differentiation abilities of stem cells have been attracting a lot of attention over the last years. Microscopy can be used to record details of the differentiation process of stem cells under different perturbations and is an important tool for studying stem cell differentiation. Since it is infeasible to quantitatively analyze a huge amount of image data manually, automated image analysis systems are urgently needed. However, the complicated morphological appearances of stem cells are challenging to the existing segmentation methods. Herein, we propose a new, automated scheme for stem cell segmentation. This scheme first uses the multi-scale blob and curvilinear structure detectors to delineate the skeletons of stem cells quickly and then segment out stem cells by refining the skeletons to the cell boundaries using multi-level sets. The initial experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",Detectors;Image segmentation;Stem cells;Hospitals;Biomedical imaging;Embryo;Active contours;Biomedical informatics;Radiology;Image analysis;stem cell differentiation;blob detection;curvilinear structure detection;cell segmentation;level set,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193318
Tissue level segmentation and tracking of biological structures in microscopic images based on density maps,"During embryogenesis, cells coordinate to form geometric arrangements. These arrangements are initially noticed as stereotypic clumps of cells that further divide to form a rigorous structure with a high density of cells. In this work, we explore density-based segmentation and tracking of cellular structures as observed in microscopy images. Using a new modified form of the Mumford-Shah energy functional, we derived a variational level-set for density-based segmentation. The novelty of the work lies in evolving an initialized contour that represents a salient structure on density maps to automatically generate novel cell structures upon convergence.

Energy minimization methods for cell motion correction and intracellular analysis in live-cell fluorescence microscopy,"The ultimate aim of many live-cell fluorescence microscopy imaging experiments is the quantitative analysis of the spatial structure and temporal behavior of intracellular objects. This requires finding the precise geometrical correspondence between the time frames for each individual cell and performing intracellular segmentation. In a previous paper we have developed a powerful multi-level-set based algorithm for automated cell segmentation and tracking of many cells in time-lapse images. In this paper, we propose approaches to exploit the output of this algorithm for the subsequent tasks of cell motion correction and intracellular segmentation. Both tasks are formulated as energy minimization problems and are solved efficiently and effectively by distance-transform and graph-cut based algorithms. The potential of the proposed approaches for intracellular analysis is demonstrated by successful experiments on biological image data showing PCNA-foci and nucleoli in HeLa cells.",Minimization methods;Motion analysis;Fluorescence;Image segmentation;Level set;Image analysis;Optical microscopy;Optical imaging;Evolution (biology);Shape;Fluorescence microscopy;cell segmentation;cell tracking;level sets;intracellular analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193255
A new method for characterization of coronary plaque composition via IVUS images,"IVUS-derived virtual histology (VH) permits the assessment of atherosclerotic plaque morphology by using radiofrequency analysis of ultrasound signals. However, it requires the acquisition to be ECG-gated, which is a major limitation of VH. Indeed, its computation can only be performed once per cardiac cycle, which significantly decreases the longitudinal resolution of VH. To overcome this limitation, the introduction of an image-based plaque characterization is of great importance. Current IVUS image processing techniques do not allow adequate identification of the coronary artery plaques. This can be improved by defining appropriate features for the different kinds of plaques. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method based on Run-length algorithm is presented and used for improving the automated characterization of the plaques within the IVUS images. The proposed feature extraction method is applied to 200 IVUS images obtained from five patients. As a result an accuracy rate of 77% was achieved. Comparing this to the accuracy rates of 75% and 71% obtained using co-occurrence and local binary pattern methods respectively indicates the superior performance of the proposed feature extraction method.",Feature extraction;Gray-scale;Biomedical engineering;Radio frequency;Image resolution;Signal processing;Signal analysis;Ultrasonic imaging;Signal resolution;Arteries;IVUS;virtual histology;plaque characterization;texture analysis;support vector machine,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193167
Feature extraction from cancer images using local phase congruency: A reliable source of image descriptors,"The (semi-) automatic detection of significant (feature) points is a key task in in vivo assessment of cancer staging and progression. However, this is a challenging task due to the relatively poor signal-to-noise, limited resolution and variable intensity of medical images. We propose to use phase congruence (PC), the Morrone and Owens (1987) feature model, to extract local descriptors. We overcome the limitations of the currently accepted PC measure, estimate PC without using an image energy weighting factor. We show that: (i) relative phase values from a single scale are not equivalent to phase values from PC, and should not be used to assess local image structure; and (ii) our approach results in higher specificity to features of interest, and lower sensitivity to noise, as demonstrated in in vitro microscopy (e.g. tumour microvessels) and in vivo pre-clinical pancreatic cancer images.",Feature extraction;In vivo;Cancer detection;Computer vision;Energy resolution;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Biomedical imaging;Current measurement;Energy measurement;phase congruency;feature extraction;monogenic signal;microscopy;pancreatic cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193281

The shading zone problem in geodesic voting and its solutions for the segmentation of tree structures. Application to the segmentation of Microglia extensions,"This paper presents a new method to segment thin tree structures, which are for example present in microglia extensions and cardiac or cerebral blood vessels. The minimal path method allows the segmentation of tubular structures between two points chosen by the user. A feature potential function is defined on the image domain. This corresponds to geodesic paths relatively to the metric weighted by the potential. We propose here to compute geodesics from a set of end points scattered in the image to a given source point. The target structure corresponds to image points with a high geodesic density. The geodesic density is defined at each pixel of the image as the number of geodesics that pass over this pixel. Since the potential takes low values on the tree structure, geodesics will locate preferably on this structure and thus the geodesic density should be high. The segmentation results depend on the distribution of the end points in the image. When only the image border is used to perform geodesic voting, the obtained geodesic density is contrasted and easy to use for image segmentation. However, when the tree to segment is complex a shading problem appears: some contours of the image can have a null density since geodesic have a better way around this region. To deal with this problem we propose several different strategies: we use several source points for the propagation by Fast Marching; a set of characteristic points or an adaptive set of points in the image or make successive segmentation in the shading zones. Numerical results on synthetic and microscopic images are presented.",Voting;Tree data structures;Image segmentation;Data mining;Microscopy;Biomedical imaging;Geophysics computing;Pixel;Level set;Blood vessels,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops,10.1109/CVPRW.2009.5204046
Multiphase geometric couplings for the segmentation of neural processes,"The ability to constrain the geometry of deformable models for image segmentation can be useful when information about the expected shape or positioning of the objects in a scene is known a priori. An example of this occurs when segmenting neural cross sections in electron microscopy. Such images often contain multiple nested boundaries separating regions of homogeneous intensities. For these applications, multiphase level sets provide a partitioning framework that allows for the segmentation of multiple deformable objects by combining several level set functions. Although there has been much effort in the study of statistical shape priors that can be used to constrain the geometry of each partition, none of these methods allow for the direct modeling of geometric arrangements of partitions. In this paper, we show how to define elastic couplings between multiple level set functions to model ribbon-like partitions. We build such couplings using dynamic force fields that can depend on the image content and relative location and shape of the level set functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows a direct way of geometrically constraining multiphase level sets for image segmentation. We demonstrate the robustness of our method by comparing it with previous level set segmentation methods.",Image segmentation;Level set;Deformable models;Shape;Layout;Solid modeling;Information geometry;Biomedical imaging;Biomembranes;Computer science,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206524
Automated classfication of particles in urinary sediment,"The particles in urinary microscopic images are hard to classify because of noisy background and strong variability of objects in shape and texture. In order to overcome these difficulties, firstly, a new method of texture feature extraction using the distance mapping based on a set of local grayvalue invariants is introduced and the feature is robust to the shift and rotation. Secondly, we reduce the high dimensional feature into a lower dimensional space using PCA. Thirdly, a multiclass SVM is applied to classify 5 categories of particles after trained them reasonably.

Automatic detecting and recognition of casts in urine sediment images,"The appearance of cast cells in urine sediment is an essential sign of serious renal or urinary tract diseases. However, due to uneven illumination, low contrast against the background and complicated components of the microscopic urine sediment images, detection and recognition of cast cells in former study can not be considered sufficient. In this paper, an efficient approach for casts detecting and recognition in urine sediment images is proposed. It consists of three stages: Firstly, 4-direction variance mapping image is acquired from gray scale image. Secondly, we obtain binary image by applying an improved adaptive bi-threshold segmentation algorithm to the above mapping image. In the last stage, five texture and shape characteristics of casts are extracted from both gray scale image and binary image. Based on these characteristics, we develop an decision-tree classifier to distinguish casts from other particles in the image. Experimental results show that our method produces satisfactory segmentation, achieves an easy-implemented, time-saving classifier and has improved recognition performance.",Image recognition;Sediments;Image segmentation;Pattern recognition;Image analysis;Microscopy;Wavelet analysis;Pattern analysis;Diseases;Lighting;Cast;Urine sediment;Adaptive double threshold;Decision tree,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/ICWAPR.2009.5207456

Multi-Modal Registration of Embryonic Images for In Vitro Fertilization,"This paper presents a robust and fully automated registration algorithm for alignment of embryonic images taken by optical quadrate microscopy (OQM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Registration of such images allows recognition of distinguishing features of viable embryos, such as growth rate, to reduce multiple births from in vitro fertilization. OQM is an optical interferometer whereas the DIC images gradient of the phase. Due to the very different nature of the image formation, the interior of the embryo appears substantially different if not totally uncorrelated between different modalities. We present an algorithm which extracts and aligns the silhouettes of the embryo-the most invariant features between different modalities. The algorithm is tested with 28 image pairs taken from different embryos at various development stages.

Computerized image analysis as a tool to investigate the relationship between endothelial morphology and permeability,"Endothelial permeability is associated with the genesis and development of atherosclerosis. Computerized image analysis is utilized to investigate the relationship between endothelial permeability and endothelial morphology.

Two categories of morphological features are then extracted, including cell shape features and intercellular features. Finally, Student's t-test is conducted to explore the relation of the morphology to permeability. The method correctly detected 82.3% cells in two test images, while the over-segmented and fused cells were 8.4% and 9.3%, respectively.

Quantifying RF formation is an important tool for biologists studying cellular regulation of EMT. The dynamic EMT process is captured using time-lapse microscopy. We use computer vision algorithms to detect and track the RF in image sequences of cells undergoing EMT to generate statistical information such as the number of RF formed during a window, lifetime of the RF, and their geometric dimension.

Near-Field Scanning Nanophotonic Microscopy—Breaking the Diffraction Limit Using Integrated Nano Light-Emitting Probe Tip,"We introduce a novel scanning ldquonanophotonicrdquo microscope through monolithic integration of a nanoscale LED (Nano-LED) on a silicon cantilever. We review two recent trends of incorporating miniature light sources on the scanning probes for near-field scanning optical microscopy: one is to attach fluorephores at the tip to define a small light source, while the other is to integrate an LED and a nanometer aperture into scanning probes, based on silicon microfabrication techniques. The creation of Nano-LED combines the advantages of previous two approaches: no external sources are required and the reduction of the light source size directly leads to resolution improvement. Two types of Nano-LEDs have been successfully demonstrated utilizing nanofabrication and microelectromechanical systems technologies: 1) formation of thin silicon dioxide light-emitting layer between heavily doped p + and n+ silicon layers created by a focused ion beam and 2) electrostatic trapping and excitation of CdSe/ZnS core-shell nanoparticles in a nanogap. We employed these probes into a standard near-field scanning and excitation setup. The probe successfully measured optical as well as topographic images of chromium test patterns with imaging resolutions of 400 and 50 nm, respectively. In addition, the directional resolution dependence of the acquired images suggests the size and shape of the light source. To our knowledge, these results are probably the first successful near-field images directly measured by such tip-embedded light sources.

The results revealed that the FOW materials exhibit optimum and wider lowest-viscosity working window than DAF that obviously would contribute enough time to flow over the wires and easily to control bond line thickness, that can enhance the quality of Stack-die CSP.

Far-field optical nanoscopy,"The resolution of a far-field optical microscope is usually limited to d = lambda/(2 n sin alpha ) > 200 nm, with n sin alpha denoting the numerical aperture of the lens and lambda the wavelength of light. This paper will discuss lens-based fluorescence microscopy concepts that feature a resolving power on the nanoscale. All these concepts share a common basis: exploiting selected (pairs of) states and transitions of the fluorescent marker to neutralize the limiting role of diffraction. Altogether, far-field optical nanoscopy is a fascinating development in optics with high relevance to the many areas of sciences, in particular the life sciences. Since it has already been a key to answering important questions in biology, and owing to its simplicity and commercial availability, it is expected that far-fieId fluorescence 'nanoscopes' to enter most cell biology and many nanoscience laboratories the near",Nanobioscience;Biomedical optical imaging;Fluorescence;Optical microscopy;Apertures;Lenses;Optical diffraction;Cells (biology);Biological cells;Laboratories,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Conference on Lasers & Electro Optics & The Pacific Rim Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics,10.1109/CLEOPR.2009.5292239
Artificial Intelligence-Based Approach for Determination of Haematologic Diseases,"Malaria and Thalassaemia are the life threatening diseases and the analysis of blood is a powerful diagnostic tool for the detection of them. Manual detection by the light microscopy is the most widely used technique for determination of malaria and possible thalassaemia. But it is a labour intensive repetitive task with time consuming. The aim of this study is to develop an automated blood image analysis system for the rapid and accurate determination of malaria, possible thalassaemia, and other abnormal red cell disorders. Two back propagation Artificial Neural Network models (3 layers and 4 layers) have been employed together with image analysis techniques to evaluate the accuracy of the classification in the recognition of medical image patterns associated with morphological features of erythrocytes in the blood. The three layers Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture has the best performance with an error of 2.74545e-005 and 86.54% correct recognition rate. The trained three layer ANN act as a final detection classifier to determine the haematologic disease. A medical consultation system has been jointly used with this system to provide consultation power. A questioning and answering dialog on the basis of patient history, physical examination and routine diagnostic test has been conducted in the medical consultation system with image analyzing result made by the trained ANN.",Artificial intelligence;Diseases;Artificial neural networks;Blood;Image analysis;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Manuals;Microscopy;Cells (biology),INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing,10.1109/CISP.2009.5301750
Resolution Enhancement in High Numerical Aperture Optical System,"Resolution enhancement requirement occurs in many optical systems, such as in imaging system, optical microscopy domain, optical lithography, and optical data storage. Some enhancement techniques are proposed, including higher numerical aperture (NA) and ring illumination. In this article, the resolution enhancement in high numerical aperture optical system is investigated by vector optics theory. It was found that the vector characteristics of the incident beam in high numerical aperture optical system affects resolution enhancement effect remarkably, and may weaken resolution enhancement effect for some cases, namely, the focus does not always decrease with increasing numerical aperture, in addition, the full width half maximum (FWHM) of focal spot differs for different direction for high numerical aperture and ring illumination, which means the resolution enhancement effect differs in different direction. Therefore, resolution enhancement of higher NA and ring illumination should be taken care of in practice use.",Apertures;Optical microscopy;Optical filters;Image resolution;Lithography;Lighting;Optical imaging;Educational institutions;High-resolution imaging;Optical diffraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing,10.1109/CISP.2009.5303156
One Kind of Macrophages Images Segmentation and Labeling Method,"Segmentation and labeling are the important preprocessing steps towards pattern recognition and image understanding and significant step towards image compression and coding. To overcome the difficulty caused by the overlapping of macrophages in the image automatic analysis, the touching macrophages need to be separated into single ones. This paper presents a novel method of macrophages image segmentation and labeling. The image first converted colors form RGB to YIQ. Then the erosion and dilation of morphological filter processing are used to get rid of noises. And then the chamfer distance transformation converts binary digital image into gray-level image. The watershed algorithm is carried out to segment the macrophages image. Finally, we use the sequential labeling algorithm which scans the image twice to label macrophages. Experimental results show this method works successfully in the segmentation and labeling of macrophages microscopic images which are get from blue channel.",Image segmentation;Labeling;Image coding;Image converters;Pattern recognition;Image analysis;Colored noise;Filters;Digital images;Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 2nd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing,10.1109/CISP.2009.5303515
"Study on HepG-2 Apoptosis Induced by Saponins Isolated from Asparagus and the Effects on the Activities of Caspase-3, 8, 9","To study the effect of saponins of asparagus on apoptosis and the variations of Caspase-8, 9, 3 activity in the process of asparagus induced apoptosis in HepG-2. Cell was administrated with different concentrations of asparagus at different time, the apoptosis rate was determined by FCM with AV-PI staining, the morphology was observed by electron microscopy, Caspase-8, 9, 3 activities was measured by kit. Experiments showed that saponins of asparagus inhibited cell growth. At 72 h, the apoptosis rate increased with concentrations markedly. Apoptotic morphology was observed .The activities of Caspase-8, 9, 3 increased with concentrations markedly, which had significant difference compared with negative control group. The activity of Caspase-8 is high at 24 h and the activities of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 is high at 48 h. Saponins of asparagus can inhibit the growth of HepG2, and the mechanism may be related to regulating Caspase-8, 9 activity, which subsequently actives Caspase-3.",Drugs;Testing;Wavelength measurement;Business;Morphology;Electron microscopy;Cancer;Transmission electron microscopy;Cells (biology);Humans,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics,10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305815
Biological Pathway Conducting Microarray-Based Cancer Classification,"The cancer classification is a major and important study field in the medical research, and DNA microarrays have been proved to provide useful and great information for cancer classification at molecular level, compared with traditional clinical or histopathological information. Bio-markers from microarray gene expression analysis have developed to a new approach for cancer classification but still face the problems such as: different genetic signatures for same cancer under different methods; disregards of small but consistent changes in expression; and lack of biological systematic opinion. Here, this paper proposes biological pathway conducting cancer classification based on gene expression data with pathway information in KEGG. There are experiments on four different data-sets for breast, colon, gloimas and lymphoma cancer: the accuracy of these classifications are all promoted about 10%, and even achieve 100% in LOOCV on gloimas data;the pathway conducting classifiers show more significant biological functional features than genetic bio-markers.",Cancer;Gene expression;Genetics;Biology computing;Data analysis;DNA computing;Colon;Signal to noise ratio;Systematics;Breast,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics,10.1109/BMEI.2009.5303634
Depth of field extension using variable annular pupil,"The DOF (depth of field) of an imaging system is closely related to the pupil function that describes the characteristics of the pupil such as size and shape. Shallow DOF is especially problematic in microscopic optical imaging systems because they have relatively large aperture size for high optical resolution. In this paper, a new DOF extension method is proposed. This is to acquire an image by integrating the incoming light while changing the size of annular pupil. By divining the pupil into annular form, the effect of the defocus aberration is reduced. Theoretical background and preliminary experimental results are shown. The results show that the DOF can effectively be extended by this method.",Apertures;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Optical microscopy;Optical noise;Integrated optics;Image sensors;Mechanical engineering;Computer science;Moon;microscopy;depth of field;pupil;deblurring,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 International Symposium on Optomechatronic Technologies,10.1109/ISOT.2009.5326060
Development of an automatic quantification method for cancer tissue microarray study,"Clinical histopathology is based on the analysis of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained tissue images. Selection of antibodies for detecting the presence, type, and grade of cancerous tissue has a great influence on the diagnostic potential of IHC tests. Automated evaluation methods for tissue microarrays applied to many combinations of antibody and tissue type can speed development of new clinical assays. We present an automatic method that successfully quantifies stain intensity, fraction of cells stained and sub-cellular location of staining in tissue microarray images. The method combines an opponent color preprocessor and a novel statistical approach for identifying brown and blue staining, followed by multilevel morphological processing. We verify the capability of our method by comparing the results to manually annotated image databases.

Observations of needle-tissue interactions,"Needles with asymmetric bevel tips naturally bend when they are inserted into soft tissue. In this study, we present an analytical model for the loads developed at the bevel tip during needle-tissue interaction. The model calculates the loads based on the geometry of the bevel edge and gel material properties. The modeled transverse force developed at the tip is compared to forces measured experimentally. The analytical model explains the trends observed in the experiments. In addition to macroscopic studies, we also present microscopic observations of needle-tissue interactions.

Cell tracking in fluorescence images of embryogenesis processes with morphological reconstruction by 4D-tubular structuring elements,"We present a simple and parameter-free nuclei tracking method for reconstructing cell dynamics in fluorescence 3D+t images of embryogenesis. The strategy is based on the use of the mathematical morphology operators directly in the 4D image. The morphological reconstruction of a marker -manually or automatically selected- in an initial spatio-temporal position generates a connected path over the time representing the cell migration. Thus, the processing provides a coherent spatiotemporal estimation of cell movement. The algorithm has been validated on in vivo images of early zebrafish and sea urchin embryogenesis acquired with two-photon laser scanning microscopy providing mean tracking rates above 98% per time step.",Fluorescence;Embryo;Image reconstruction;Microscopy;Image analysis;In vivo;Biology;Image segmentation;Shape;USA Councils,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333756
"Cell cycle dependence of protein subcellular location inferred from static, asynchronous images","Protein subcellular location is one of the most important determinants of protein function during cellular processes. Changes in protein behavior during the cell cycle are expected to be involved in cellular reprogramming during disease and development, and there is therefore a critical need to understand cell-cycle dependent variation in protein localization which may be related to aberrant pathway activity. With this goal, it would be useful to have an automated method that can be applied on a proteomic scale to identify candidate proteins showing cell-cycle dependent variation of location. Fluorescence microscopy, and especially automated, high-throughput microscopy, can provide images for tens of thousands of fluorescently-tagged proteins for this purpose. Previous work on analysis of cell cycle variation has traditionally relied on obtaining time-series images over an entire cell cycle; these methods are not applicable to the single time point images that are much easier to obtain on a large scale. Hence a method that can infer cell cycle-dependence of proteins from asynchronous, static cell images would be preferable. In this work, we demonstrate such a method that can associate protein pattern variation in static images with cell cycle progression. We additionally show that a one-dimensional parameterization of cell cycle progression and protein feature pattern is sufficient to infer association between localization and cell cycle.",Microscopy;Protein engineering;Fluorescence;Cells (biology);Diseases;Proteomics;Image analysis;USA Councils;Focusing;Biological processes,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332888

Registration-based segmentation of nerve cells in microscopy images,"Nerve cell segmentation is important for better understanding of the connections between broken nerves. In this paper, we propose a registration-based segmentation to improve the segmentation from a series of microscopic image sequence. A global iterative closest point (ICP) registration is first employed to find the corresponding cells between neighboring frames. Then a local ICP registration is adopted to refine shape matching between corresponding cells. When registering the current frame to the previous frame, a missing cell in the current frame can obtain a dummy region with respect to the previous frame. The dummy region is then confirmed as a cell by checking the correspondence of the cell among the previous, current and next frames. Experimental results show that the proposed registration based algorithm recovers the cells that are missed in conventional segmentation.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Shape;Iterative closest point algorithm;Deformable models;USA Councils;Sun;Mutual information;Flowcharts;Image sequences,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332851
Cell segmentation in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy with temporally varying sub-cellular fusion protein patterns,"Fluorescently tagged proteins such as GFP-PCNA produce rich dynamically varying textural patterns of foci distributed in the nucleus. This enables the behavioral study of sub-cellular structures during different phases of the cell cycle. The varying punctuate patterns of fluorescence, drastic changes in SNR, shape and position during mitosis and abundance of touching cells, however, require more sophisticated algorithms for reliable automatic cell segmentation and lineage analysis. Since the cell nuclei are non-uniform in appearance, a distribution-based modeling of foreground classes is essential. The recently proposed graph partitioning active contours (GPAC) algorithm supports region descriptors and flexible distance metrics. We extend GPAC for fluorescence-based cell segmentation using regional density functions and dramatically improve its efficiency for segmentation from O(N4) to O(N2), for an image with N2 pixels, making it practical and scalable for high throughput microscopy imaging studies.",Fluorescence;Microscopy;Proteins;Partitioning algorithms;Image segmentation;Shape;Pattern analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Active contours;Density functional theory,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334168
Elastic light scattering spectroscopy for the detection of early cancer and pre-cancer,"We have investigated elastic scattering spectroscopy in large-scale clinical studies for several organ areas, including multi-center studies for Gl diseases. The method of elastic-scattering spectroscopy (ESS) has a simple fiber geometry that is sensitive to the sub-cellular morphology and architectural changes, such as nuclear grade and nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, mitochondrial size and density, etc., which correlate with features used by pathologists when performing histological assessment. Most cancers arise in the epithelium, which is the superficial tissue layer of an organ, with a thickness, typically, of 100-500 micrometers. Hence, sensitivity to the optical properties of the epithelial layer requires superficial measurement techniques. In several of our studies, the two fibers typically have a core diameter of 200 microns, with a center-to-center separation of around 250 microns. Thus, most of the elastically-scattered light is collected from the epithelial layer. The theoretical underpinnings of elastic light scattering in tissue, based on Mie theory, will be reviewed, and Monte Carlo methods for computational simulation will be illustrated.",Light scattering;Spectroscopy;Cancer detection;Optical scattering;Mie scattering;Large-scale systems;Diseases;Electronic switching systems;Geometry;Morphology,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 IEEE LEOS Annual Meeting Conference Proceedings,10.1109/LEOS.2009.5343268

Support vector classification for pathological prostate images based on texture features of multi-categories,"This paper presents an automated system for grading pathological images of prostatic carcinoma based on a set of texture features extracted by multi-categories of methods including multi-wavelets, Gabor-filters, GLCM, and fractal dimensions. We apply 5-fold cross-validation procedure to a set of 205 pathological prostate images for training and testing. Experimental results show that the fractal dimension (FD) feature set can achieve 92.7% of CCR without feature selection and 94.1% of CCR with feature selection by using support vector machine classifier. If features of multi-categories are considered and optimized, the CCR can be promoted to 95.6%. The CCR drops to 92.7% if FD-based features are removed from the combined feature set. Such a result suggests that features of FD category have significant contributions and should be included for consideration if features are selected from multi-categories.",Pathology;Fractals;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Data mining;Support vector machine classification;Cancer;Biopsy;Computer science;Testing;Fractal dimension;Gleason grading;prostatic carcinoma;prostate image;SVM,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,"2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346754

Segmentation and tracking individual Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in dense populations of motile cells,"The dynamics of individual bacteria underlies the manifestation of complex multicellular behaviours such as biofilm development and colony expansion. High resolution movies of expanding bacterial colonies reveal intriguing patterns of cell motions. A quantitative understanding of the observed behaviour in relation to the bacteria's own motile apparatus and to hydrodynamic forces requires that bacteria be identified and tracked over time. This represents a demanding undertaking as their size is close to the diffraction limit; they are very close to each other; and a typical image may contain over a thousand cells. Here, we describe the approach that we have developed to segment individual bacteria and track them in high resolution phase contrast microscopy movies. We report that over 99% of non-overlapping bacteria could be segmented correctly using mathematical morphology, and we present preliminary results that exploit this new capability.",Microorganisms;Computer vision;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Microscopy;Pixel;Motion pictures;Hydrodynamics;Surface morphology;High-resolution imaging;bacteria;tracking;image analysis;image segmentation;cell motility;twitching motility;agar plate,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 24th International Conference Image and Vision Computing New Zealand,10.1109/IVCNZ.2009.5378409
Histopathological Diagnostic Support Technology Using Higher-Order Local Autocorrelation Features,"This paper proposes a technology for histopathological diagnostic support that utilizes the correlation-based features of histopathological tissues. In histopathological diagnosis, a clinical pathologist conducts a diagnosis of normal tissues and cancerous tissues. However, recently, the shortage of clinical pathologists is posing increasing burdens to meet the demands for such diagnoses, and this is causing serious social problems. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a technology of histopathological diagnostic support that uses higher-order local autocorrelation (HLAC) features. The proposed method can automatically screen tissue that is believed to be normal tissue to detect cancerous tissue as well as tissue that is suspected of being cancerous to detect abnormalities. Consequently, we can reduce the burden on clinical pathologists, allowing them to concentrate on diagnosing cancer.",Autocorrelation;Cardiac disease;Intelligent systems;Security;Cancer;Neoplasms;Cardiovascular diseases;Lungs;HLAC;histopathological diagnosis;cancer;biopsy;automatic screening,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Symposium on Bio-inspired Learning and Intelligent Systems for Security,10.1109/BLISS.2009.29
Structure Extracting and Matching Based on Similarity-Pictorial Structure Model for Microscopic Images,"An improved pictorial structure method (PS) is presented in this paper for structure detecting and matching in microscopic images of the micro structure fabricated using micro-fabrication technology. The obtained structure information of the micro objects is important for the following 3D visual calculation process. Although PS method can extract and match features successfully by evaluating the appearance and shape under slightly varying illumination, while the microscopic images are taken under considerable varying illumination, appearance description of traditional PS model performs poor for our application. In this paper, self-similarity descriptors were used for features extracting and appearance describing for images of micro objects under large changed illumination. The special local features on the micro objects ensure the feasibility of self-similarity method. In the proposed method, the self-similarity descriptors of patches which reflect the information of local object structure are extracted. At the same time, the geometric relationship among patches is modeled by PS. By using our similarity-pictorial structure method (combination of local self-similarity descriptors and pictorial structure model), the structure of object can be extracted and matched exactly. Finally, contrast experiments between PS method and our method for structure extracting and matching on object structure in microscopic images of MEMS components under large changed illumination are presented.

Adaptive fuzzy moving K-means clustering algorithm for image segmentation,"Image segmentation remains one of the major challenges in image analysis. Many segmentation algorithms have been developed for various applications. Unsatisfactory results have been encountered in some cases, for many existing segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we introduce three modified versions of the conventional moving k-means clustering algorithm called the fuzzy moving k-means, adaptive moving k-means and adaptive fuzzy moving k-means algorithms for image segmentation application. Based on analysis done using standard images (i.e. original bridge and noisy bridge) and hard evidence on microscopic digital image (i.e. segmentation of Sprague Dawley rat sperm), our final segmentation results compare favorably with the results obtained by the conventional k-means, fuzzy c-means and moving k-means algorithms. The qualitative and quantitative analysis done proved that the proposed algorithms are less sensitive with respect to noise. As such, the occurrence of dead centers, center redundancy and trapped center at local minima problems can be avoided. The proposed clustering algorithms are also less sensitive to initialization process of clustering value. The final center values obtained are located within their respective groups of data. This enabled the size and shape of the object in question to be maintained and preserved. Based on the simplicity and capabilities of the proposed algorithms, these algorithms are suitable to be implemented in consumer electronics products such as digital microscope, or digital camera as post processing tool for digital images.","Clustering algorithms;Image segmentation;Image analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Bridges;Digital images;Shape;Consumer electronics;Electron microscopy;Digital cameras;Fuzzy moving k-means, adaptive moving k-means, fuzzy k-means, adaptive fuzzy moving k-means, image segmentation, clustering.

Aceclofenac ethosomes for enhanced transdermal delivery,"The oral administration of aceclofenac has often resulted in side effects with chronic use. Using the transdermal route eliminates these side effects. Aceclofenac ethosomes were prepared and incorporated into a gel to enhance the skin permeability of aceclofenac. Ethosomal system comprised of phospholipids, ethanol, propylene glycol and lecithin. Different formulations were prepared with varying concentrations of lecithin and ethanol. The optical microscopy confirmed the formulation of multilamellar vesicles. The vesicle size of the ethosomes ranged between 0.696-1.140 ¿m. Surface morphology was conducted by scanning electron microscopy. The entrapment efficiency was determined by centrifugation method. Effect of ethanol and lecithin concentration on entrapment of ethosomes was observed. Franz diffusion cell was used to evaluate the in vitro transdermal permeability of aceclofenac ethosomes. The studies were carried out using mouse skin as well as commercial sigma membrane. The in vitro drug permeation of the optimised formulation was compared with commercial conventional gel-Ziynac gel. The flux values of different ethosomal formulation were observed between 116.5 ¿g/cm2/hr to 226.15 ¿g/cm2 /hr. Formulation 5 showed maximum J value 226.1 as compared to marketed one 131.5 ¿g/cm2 /hr. From the results of the present study it can be concluded that ethosomes improve the transdermal flux, prolong the release and represent an active carrier for sustained transdermal delivery.",Ethanol;Skin;Permeability;Optical microscopy;In vitro;Anti-freeze;Electron optics;Surface morphology;Scanning electron microscopy;Mice,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 International Conference on Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Engineering,10.1109/ICBPE.2009.5384096
Image fusion for photonic quantum ring laser structures investigated by confocal scanning laser microscopy,"Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM) allows the acquisition of image stacks, representing optical sections on the volume of the specimen. An image corresponding to an optical section will in some cases contain defocused, low contrast or saturated regions for the areas of the sample which are not in focal plane. In the case of the Photonic Quantum Ring (PQR) laser structures, it is important to have images consisting of regions of uniform quality in order to observe morphological details that are linked to the photocurrent confinement. In this purpose we have developed an image fusion method, which based on a stack of CSLM images will output a fused image consisting of square regions from different images in the stack.

On the approximated control of optical tweezers via flatness based approach,"A flatness based control strategy for the manipulation of a microscopical particle is presented in this paper. The strategy was possible due to the fact the optical tweezers (OT) is a flat system, with flat outputs given by the horizontal and vertical position coordinates of the geometric center of the laser beam. The controller was designed under the consideration that the particle is suspended in a frictionless medium. Therefore the stability analysis was relatively simple. The effectiveness of the control strategy was tested by numerical simulations, where the system tracked a straight line, an elliptic curve, and carry out the rest-to-rest transfer maneuver task by using a smooth trajectory.",Optical control;Optical saturation;Laser beams;Control systems;Optical computing;Optical microscopy;Velocity control;Numerical simulation;Trajectory;Laser theory;Optical tweezers;flatness based control;saturation function;velocity observers;numerical simulation,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)",10.1109/ICEEE.2009.5393486
Optical resonance of nanometer scale bow-tie antenna and bow-tie shaped aperture antenna,"In this paper, the nanometer scale bow-tie antenna and its geometrically complementary bow-tie shaped aperture antenna are proposed and discussed focusing on their optical resonance characteristics. To demonstrate such structures, the finite integration technique is developed in broad band calculations especially in the visible and infrared region. Characterized by surface plasmon resonance, localized strong field are found at the separation gap of the bow-tie antenna, thus providing satisfying near-field confinement and enhancement. In addition, the resonant properties depending on the effects of the geometrical parameters of length and gap distance are systematical studied. Furthermore, comparison of the performances between the two structures is presented for the first time. This investigation can be applied to near-field optical detection or imaging, scanning probe microscopy, lithography and optical manipulation, which has a promising prospect for nanoantennas.",Aperture antennas;Resonance;Optical sensors;Plasmons;Dipole antennas;Geometrical optics;Optical surface waves;Optical devices;Optical microscopy;Frequency;Optical resonance;antennas;aperture antennas,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference,10.1109/APMC.2009.5384176
Segmentation of colorectal pathology images using level sets,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women. Generally surgery is by total excision of the mesorectum (TME), though it often has a poor outcome due to affected lymph nodes close to the resection boundary. Advancements in diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer require integration of information from different sources such as pathology macroscopic and microscopic images and magnetic resonance images. Evaluation of the mesorectal fascia and the rectal wall are important for both staging the cancer and predicting the outcome of the TME. An algorithm is developed for segmentation of the rectal wall on macroscopic pathology slice images. The information is vital for registration of the images for reconstruction of the resected volume but more importantly for fusion of images in order to evaluate different measures and establish correspondences across modalities. The resected specimen is segmented from the background using thresholding. Following, a number of features such as intensity different order statistics and phase information are evaluated for the region of interest. The features are incorporated in a level set framework for the segmentation of the rectal wall.",Image segmentation;Pathology;Level set;Cancer;Oncological surgery;Lymph nodes;Magnetic force microscopy;Magnetic resonance;Fascia;Image reconstruction;Colorectal cancer;pathology;segmentation;level sets,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 9th International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine,10.1109/ITAB.2009.5394452
Liquid-solid nano-interactions of ceramic and metals,"Wetting behaviour of a low surface tension fluid as hydrophobic paraffin oil on metal and ceramic surfaces was studied at nano-scale by SPFM non contact probe analysis and at micro-scale by optical microscopy. Solid surfaces were obtained by sputtering molybdenum and aluminum over silicon wafer substrates. Bottom-up method based on vapor condensation technique was used to deposit the fluid upon the evaluated solid surfaces. Force-Distance curves showed that liquid initially disposed over all the substrates as an extremely thin, full coating, film with an apparent variable depth depending upon the evaluated solid substrates. This layer appeared to be extremely adherent and showed the features of a gel instead behaving as a proper liquid. By going on with the fluid condensation process and increasing the total amount of deposited fluid we observed the formation of nanodrops lying on and coexisting with the previously deposited film. Drop contact angles values were found characteristic of the specific solid substrate and appeared indeed to be inversely proportional to the first deposited film thickness. The fluid deposition processes were prolonged up to reach micrometric sized dimensions where the gel-like features disappeared and typical liquid features appeared. In order to reveal the status of the original nanometric liquid layer several micrometric sized drops were therefore partially or totally removed from the substrate with AFM tips. It was found that no apparent mixing occurred between these two different conditions of the same deposited fluid. To deeply explore the features of this ice-like early deposited film and to detect if the observed behavior should be more dependent upon the surface roughness or surface energetic the same samples underwent fluid vapor exposures after being treated with low surface energy silanes that created a monolayer coating. These surfaces showed a completely different behaviour. A huge formation of very similar nano-drops was immediately observed. The performed analysis shows that at the nano-scale the Young Equation does not apply satisfactorily, even in the case of extremely flat inert surfaces in contact with an inert and non polar liquid featured as a quite common basis for biological applications.",Ceramics;Substrates;Solids;Nanobioscience;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface treatment;Optical films;Optical microscopy;Coatings,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 9th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO),
Low-temperature Si/Si wafer bonding using boride treated surface,"An approach for Si/Si wafer bonding based on boride-solution treatment was presented. The bonding energy is higher than the Si fracture energy by annealing at 180°C. The properties of the bonded structures were studied in terms of the interface shape, electrical and optical characteristic through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), interface I–V curve, and so on. In this method, the surfaces of two wafers are active by Boride solution, and then following a thermal annealing process. The bonding strength was found to be sufficiently high and could withstand the subsequent etching and polishing procedures of the bonded wafers. This low temperature wafer bonding technology can be used in Optic Electronics Integrated Circuit and this technology with potential to meet a broad range of future telecommunication and computing systems' needs.",Wafer bonding;Surface treatment;Surface cracks;Annealing;Optical microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy;Integrated circuit technology;Shape;Electron optics;Etching;low temperature bonding;Si/ Si;SEM;I–V curve,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Asia Communications and Photonics conference and Exhibition (ACP),
Studying liver cancer metastasis by in vivo imaging and flow cytometer,"Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC) is associated with liver cirrhosis 60–80% of the time. Liver cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world, with approximately 1,000,000 cases reported every year. About 80% of people with primary liver cancer are male. Although two-thirds of people have advanced liver disease when they seek medical help, one third of the patients have cancer that has not progressed beyond the liver. HCC may metastasize to the lung, bones, kidney, and many other organs. Surgical resection, liver transplantation, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are the foundation of current HCC therapies. However the outcomes are poor:the survival rate is almost zero for metastatic HCC patients. Molecular mechanisms of HCC metastasis need to be understood better and new therapies must be developed to selectively target to unique characteristics of HCC cell growth and metastasis. We have developed the “in vivo microscopy” to study the mechanisms that govern liver tumor cell spread through the microenvironment in vivo with real-time confocal near-infrared fluorescence imaging. A recently developed “in vivo flow cytometer” and optical imaging are used to assess liver tumor cell spreading and the circulation kinetics of liver tumor cells. A real- time quantitative monitoring of circulating liver tumor cells by the in vivo flow cytometer will be useful to assess the effectiveness of the potential therapeutic interventions.",Cancer;Metastasis;In vivo;Tumors;Optical imaging;Medical treatment;Liver diseases;Biomedical imaging;Lungs;Bones;In vivo flow cytometry;in vivo fluorescence imaging;cancer metastasis;liver cancer;circulating cells;nearinfrared;confocal imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Asia Communications and Photonics conference and Exhibition (ACP),
CdSe QDs-tagged-based encoded microparticle for miniaturized and multiplexed Immunoassay,"Micromachining techniques, which originated in the microelectronics industry, have been employed to manufacture microparticles bearing an engraved dot-type signature for biomolecular encoding. These metallic microstructures are photolithographically defined and manufactured in a highly reproducible manner. In addition, the code introduced on the particle face is a straightforward visible feature that is easily recognizable with the use of optical microscopy on the grounds of the CdSe Quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescent probes. The number of distinct codes theoretically could be many thousands, depending on the coding element numbers. Such microparticles are, thus, with appropriate surface organic functionalizations, ideal for encoding biomolecular libraries and serving as a platform for developing high-throughput multiplexed bioassay schemes based on suspension array technology.",Encoding;Optical microscopy;Immune system;Micromachining;Microelectronics;Manufacturing industries;Microstructure;Face recognition;Biomedical optical imaging;Quantum dots;micromachining;CdSe quantum dots (QDs);encoded microparticle;immunoassay,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,Proceedings of the 2009 12th International Symposium on Integrated Circuits,
Interaction of light with an array of subwavelength apertures in a metallic slab,"For many applications in nanophotonics, such as near field microscopy, spectroscopy, high density optical data storage, photolithography, etc, it would be very useful to find ways to have large enough optical transmission at visible wavelengths through normally-semi-opaque metallic thin films, with (and without) subwavelength apertures. Since light fields in metallic films and subwavelength cylindrical metallic apertures are mostly evanescent, optical transmission of such structures is weak. The transmission across these metallic films can be much enhanced if it is mediated by surface waves, such as surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) on the two sides of the metal film. The mechanisms of efficient light energy transfer through a two dimensional array of nano-apertures and the role of the SPPs have been under discussion for some time. At the same time, several applications of the enhanced transmission have been proposed and demonstrated. After an account of these developments, we describe results of our steady state and fsec time resolved measurements of optical properties of an array of subwavelength slits in metallic slabs, including fsec dynamics of SPPs, role of Wood anomalies in determining the transmission (T) and reflection (R) spectral features, possible use of the structure as a polarization selector and a wavelength filter in a range of visible wavelengths, reciprocity of T and R, and so on.",Optical arrays;Apertures;Slabs;Optical films;Optical surface waves;Optical filters;Optical microscopy;Surface waves;Nanophotonics;Spectroscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 4th International Conference on Computers and Devices for Communication (CODEC),
"HISOLD 4P Q&R, COST project for solder material innovations and solder joint properties assessment","The solder joints properties are in connection with their microstructure, which is the result of the soldering process temperature gradient action over the trinomial solder alloy/paste, electronic components terminals/pin and PCBs pads characteristics (4P soldering model). The temperature gradient was determinated by the specific thermal profile of the soldering process. As part of COST Action MP0602, Working Group 2 (The properties of solder joints), the HISOLD 4P-Q&R group project investigated, into integrated approach, the properties of solder joints realized by different paste-pad-pin-process reflow soldering formulas, with focus on innovative lead-free solder alloys, including composite type with nanoparticles content. The 4P soldering model concept and the project proposed investigations are based on numerous experiments and macro/microstructural analyzes including optical and X-ray inspections, surface acoustic microscopy (SAM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoindentation and electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD), before and after electrical, mechanical and climatic tests. Proposals for solder joints functionality standard test methods, test vehicles and data bases was elaborated as result of environmental stress studies, thermodynamical, rheological and macro/microstructural solder joints analyses, based on IPC references. A standard SAC solder alloy and the reflow soldering process was used as reference.

Using granulometry and watershed for breast tumor cells segmentation,"In this paper, we present an efficient method based on mathematical morphology for segmenting microscopic breast cells images. The proposed approach consists on estimating the size cells distribution using granulometry. Drawing the spectrum will give us important information about different size distribution corresponding to the different cells present in the image. This information will be used in order to eliminate non tumor cells distinguished by their small size and irregular shape compared to tumor cells. The markers are then extracted using the maximum on the distance function of the resulted image. Finally, we apply the watershed algorithm. The proposed method is simple and efficient.",Breast tumors;Morphology;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image analysis;Malignant tumors;Circuits and systems;Image texture analysis;Cancer;Morphological operations;Cells segmentation;Granulometry;Marker extraction;Mathematical morphology;Medical image analysis;Watershed,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,"2009 3rd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems (SCS)",10.1109/ICSCS.2009.5412539
Object segmentation by traversing a pose-shape manifold,"Recent investigations in estimating object shape in images and leveraging knowledge of expected shapes to perform object segmentation have necessitated the formalization of a rigorous mathematical theory of shape. Most of the existing theory in nonlinear shape manifolds lacks physically meaningful parameterization of the shape components, for e.g., pose. We build a novel pose-shape manifold in which manifold parameters signify physically meaningful pose/shape deformation modes. Geodesic distances on this manifold estimate dissimilarities in pose and shape. The segmentation method initializes a template point on the pose-shape manifold and navigates the manifold to converge on the correct pose and shape of the object to be segmented. We show that this method is superior to traditional active contour methods in robustness to edges from clutter. Application of this method to cell delineation of vascular myocytes from phase-contrast microscopy gives reliable segmentation (within ±5% RMS pixel error) of cell boundaries and reliable estimates of geodesic object deformation.",Object segmentation;Shape measurement;Biomedical measurements;Level measurement;Manifolds;Navigation;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Principal component analysis;Pose;shape;manifold;biomedical image segmentation;microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413464

A fractal dimension based optimal wavelet packet analysis technique for classification of meningioma brain tumours,"With the heterogeneous nature of tissue texture, using a single resolution approach for optimum classification might not suffice. In contrast, a multiresolution wavelet packet analysis can decompose the input signal into a set of frequency subbands giving the opportunity to characterise the texture at the appropriate frequency channel. An adaptive best bases algorithm for optimal bases selection for meningioma histopathological images is proposed, via applying the fractal dimension (FD) as the bases selection criterion in a tree-structured manner. Thereby, the most significant subband that better identifies texture discontinuities will only be chosen for further decomposition, and its fractal signature would represent the extracted feature vector for classification. The best basis selection using the FD outperformed the energy based selection approaches, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.25% as compared to 83.44% and 73.75% for the co-occurrence matrix and energy texture signatures; respectively.",Fractals;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet packets;Tumors;Signal resolution;Frequency;Energy resolution;Image texture analysis;Signal analysis;Feature extraction;Texture analysis;multiresolution representation;wavelet packet;fractal dimension;Bayesian classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414534
Laser grooving characterization for dicing defects reduction and its challenges,"Blade sawing has been widely used in semiconductor industry and it is the most conventional process in semiconductor manufacturing to produce singulated ICs. This well established dicing technique poses challenges to process next generation of wafer when the wafer fabrication technology is fast scaling down in node size to 90-, 45-, 32-and 22-nm where low-k dielectric is used. ILD (Inter-Layer Dielectric) and metal layers peelings, cracks, chipping, and delamination are the most common dicing defects observed on low-k wafer processed by the traditional blade sawing techniques. This paper presents an experimental study to improve the dicing performance and quality on processing low-k wafer by using a combination of laser grooving process and traditional blade sawing technique. Some low-k wafers were used as test vehicles. The laser process outcomes and responses are governed by the changes of process input parameters such as laser power, repetition rate, grooving feed speed, defocus amount and street index. The effects of the process parameters on the laser kerf geometry, grooving edge quality and defects are evaluated by using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental results have shown that the dicing quality produced by using a combination of laser grooving and blade sawing technique can significantly minimize the dicing defects. It is one of the potential solutions to address the quality and yield issues in low-k wafer dicing. The key challenges of laser grooving and recommended future development works are discussed.",Blades;Sawing;Optical microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy;Dielectrics;Laser transitions;Power lasers;Semiconductor lasers;Electronics industry;Manufacturing processes,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 11th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference,10.1109/EPTC.2009.5416427

Contact Guidance Based on the Nanostructures Fabricated by Nanoimprint Lithography,"Contact Guidance is an important phenomenon in the bio field. However it is complex and time-consuming to fabricate the micro/nano morphology used to guide cell growth behavior. Novel method of employing nanoimprint lithography to mass-produce nanostructures was investigated. The nanoimprint stamp consisting of uniform nanogrooves was fabricated by holographic lithography and inductively coupled plasma etching. The stamp was used to nanoimprint many polyethylene terephthalate glycol substrates. The substrates were taken to cultivate vascular smooth muscle cells. The atomic force microscopy measurement shows the width of replicated grooves is 550 nm and the nanoimprint process is successful. The optical microscope characterization demonstrate that the patterned nanogrooves manufactured by nanoimprint have an obvious contact guidance for cell growth.

Automatic segmentation of Drosophila neurons for content based retrieval using a minimum spanning tree approach,"A critical part in our knowledge of the brain is the understanding of the structure and morphology of neurons. In recent years, we have witnessed a tremendous effort in developing libraries of neuronal structures that can be used for multiple purposes. These critical studies include modeling the brain connectivity and understanding how cellular structure regulates brain function. Presently, methods for tracing neuronal structures from microscopy images of neurons are not only tedious, but prone to user bias; hence they are not suitable for practical purposes. State of the art automatic neuron tracing algorithms fail to give satisfactory results for neuron images with low contrast, discontinuous filaments, and complex branching. In this paper, we develop Tree2Tree, an automatic neuron segmentation and morphology generation algorithm. Our algorithm uses a global tree linking strategy to connect smaller medial trees of visible components of the neuron in order to give an optimal explanation of the brightness patterns of the neuron branches. We intend to utilize these graph-based segmentation results in the retrieval of similar neurons from an extensive database of segmented neurons.

Challenges in Computational Histopathology: The Feasibility of FTIR Spectroscopy in Clustering,"The aim of this project is to find suitable, reliable and fast methods for computational cancer histopathology. Clustering of FTIR spectra has been done before, but this paper uses features instead of whole spectra or its second derivative. The resolution of FTIR spectroscopic image is not good enough, because pathologists need better resolution and different magnifications for current histopathologic recognition. When there is no way to compare the result of FTIR and light microscopic image at high resolution, it is also impossible to compare the results of clustering using FTIR spectroscopy. A computational histopathological method using both FTIR spectroscopy and light microscopic images is proposed in this study. Only important parts of tissue samples are measured using FTIR spectroscopy, which conserves time. Then the measured spectra is compared to preconceived spectral database. Spectral database is formed by measuring perfectly cultivated samples of tissue types using FTIR spectroscopy.",Spectroscopy;Cancer;Microscopy;Clustering algorithms;Image resolution;Databases;Euclidean distance;Computational histopathology;FTIR spectroscopy;clustering;tissue sample,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 Fifth International Conference on Signal Image Technology and Internet Based Systems,10.1109/SITIS.2009.20
Microscopic texture components classification for image segmentation,"The paper presents the possibility of using a sliding window for image feature extraction in order to identify image regions of interest. The study includes the comparison of feature extraction methods both in the space and frequency domains using the discrete Fourier transform and the discrete wavelet transform to achieve reliable classification results for a given application. The compactness of feature clusters is evaluated exploiting a proposed numerical criterion. In case of real image data, the clusters compactness can often be improved by employing a chosen smoothing method on the raw data. In this paper, the procedure of smoothing, feature extraction and classification is applied to microscopic images of aluminum alloys in order to isolate regions of similar properties and to study their relationship. To achieve this goal the sliding window classification results are combined and isolated misclassified subregions repaired. The proportion of misclassified regions is then used for the evaluation of the efficiency of the proposed method along with the proposed measure of cluster compactness.",Microscopy;Image segmentation;Abstracts;Weaving;Vectors;Legged locomotion;Chemicals,INPROCEEDINGS,2009,2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference,
Automatic Detection of Large Dense-Core Vesicles in Secretory Cells and Statistical Analysis of Their Intracellular Distribution,"Analyzing the morphological appearance and the spatial distribution of large dense-core vesicles (granules) in the cell cytoplasm is central to the understanding of regulated exocytosis. This paper is concerned with the automatic detection of granules and the statistical analysis of their spatial locations in different cell groups. We model the locations of granules of a given cell as a realization of a finite spatial point process and the point patterns associated with the cell groups as replicated point patterns of different spatial point processes. First, an algorithm to segment the granules using electron microscopy images is proposed. Second, the relative locations of the granules with respect to the plasma membrane are characterized by two functional descriptors: the empirical cumulative distribution function of the distances from the granules to the plasma membrane and the density of granules within a given distance to the plasma membrane. The descriptors of the different cells for each group are compared using bootstrap procedures. Our results show that these descriptors and the testing procedure allow discriminating between control and treated cells. The application of these novel tools to studies of secretion should help in the analysis of diseases associated with dysfunctional secretion, such as diabetes.",Statistical analysis;Plasma density;Biomembranes;Plasma applications;Fluids and secretions;Image segmentation;Electron microscopy;Distribution functions;Testing;Diseases;Replicated spatial point patterns;image segmentation;exocytosis;bootstrap methods;electron microscopy;large dense-core vesicles.;Pattern analysis;Clustering;Computer vision;Biology and genetics;Stochastic processes;Correlation and regression analysis,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2008.30
Quantitative Comparison of Spot Detection Methods in Fluorescence Microscopy,"Quantitative analysis of biological image data generally involves the detection of many subresolution spots. Especially in live cell imaging, for which fluorescence microscopy is often used, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be extremely low, making automated spot detection a very challenging task. In the past, many methods have been proposed to perform this task, but a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of these methods is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the most frequently used detection methods for this purpose. These include seven unsupervised and two supervised methods. We perform experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which the ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations to compare with. The results from both types of experiments suggest that for very low SNRs ( ¿ 2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall. Of the unsupervised methods, the detectors based on the so-called h -dome transform from mathematical morphology or the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform perform comparably, and have the advantage that they do not require a cumbersome learning stage. At high SNRs ( > 5), the difference in performance of all considered detectors becomes negligible.",Fluorescence;Image analysis;Object detection;Optical microscopy;Biomedical imaging;Optical imaging;Signal to noise ratio;Machine learning;Detectors;Proteins;Fluorescence microscopy;image filtering;machine learning;noise reduction;object detection,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2009.2025127
Multiple Nuclei Tracking Using Integer Programming for Quantitative Cancer Cell Cycle Analysis,"Automated cell segmentation and tracking are critical for quantitative analysis of cell cycle behavior using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. However, the complex, dynamic cell cycle behavior poses new challenges to the existing image segmentation and tracking methods. This paper presents a fully automated tracking method for quantitative cell cycle analysis. In the proposed tracking method, we introduce a neighboring graph to characterize the spatial distribution of neighboring nuclei, and a novel dissimilarity measure is designed based on the spatial distribution, nuclei morphological appearance, migration, and intensity information. Then, we employ the integer programming and division matching strategy, together with the novel dissimilarity measure, to track cell nuclei. We applied this new tracking method for the tracking of HeLa cancer cells over several cell cycles, and the validation results showed that the high accuracy for segmentation and tracking at 99.5% and 90.0%, respectively. The tracking method has been implemented in the cell-cycle analysis software package, DCELLIQ, which is freely available.",Linear programming;Cancer;Drugs;Image segmentation;Bioinformatics;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Biomedical engineering;Radiology;Hospitals;Anti-cancer drug screening;cell cycle analysis;segmentation and tracking;time-lapse fluorescence microscopy,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2009.2027813
Computerized Image-Based Detection and Grading of Lymphocytic Infiltration in HER2+ Breast Cancer Histopathology,"The identification of phenotypic changes in breast cancer (BC) histopathology on account of corresponding molecular changes is of significant clinical importance in predicting disease outcome. One such example is the presence of lymphocytic infiltration (LI) in histopathology, which has been correlated with nodal metastasis and distant recurrence in HER2+ BC patients. In this paper, we present a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) scheme to automatically detect and grade the extent of LI in digitized HER2+ BC histopathology. Lymphocytes are first automatically detected by a combination of region growing and Markov random field algorithms. Using the centers of individual detected lymphocytes as vertices, three graphs (Voronoi diagram, Delaunay triangulation, and minimum spanning tree) are constructed and a total of 50 image-derived features describing the arrangement of the lymphocytes are extracted from each sample. A nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme, graph embedding (GE), is then used to project the high-dimensional feature vector into a reduced 3-D embedding space. A support vector machine classifier is used to discriminate samples with high and low LI in the reduced dimensional embedding space. A total of 41 HER2+ hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained images obtained from 12 patients were considered in this study. For more than 100 three-fold cross-validation trials, the architectural feature set successfully distinguished samples of high and low LI levels with a classification accuracy greater than 90%. The popular unsupervised Varma-Zisserman texton-based classification scheme was used for comparison and yielded a classification accuracy of only 60%. Additionally, the projection of the 50 image-derived features for all 41 tissue samples into a reduced dimensional space via GE allowed for the visualization of a smooth manifold that revealed a continuum between low, intermediate, and high levels of LI. Since it is known that extent of LI in BC biopsy specimens is a prognostic indicator, our CADx scheme will potentially help clinicians determine disease outcome and allow them to make better therapy recommendations for patients with HER2+ BC.",Cancer detection;Breast cancer;Diseases;Metastasis;Computer aided diagnosis;Markov random fields;Tree graphs;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Visualization;Breast cancer (BC);classification;digital pathology;feature extraction;image analysis;lymphocytic infiltration (LI);nonlinear dimensionality reduction;prognosis;segmentation;texture,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2009.2035305
Improved Automatic Detection and Segmentation of Cell Nuclei in Histopathology Images,"Automatic segmentation of cell nuclei is an essential step in image cytometry and histometry. Despite substantial progress, there is a need to improve accuracy, speed, level of automation, and adaptability to new applications. This paper presents a robust and accurate novel method for segmenting cell nuclei using a combination of ideas. The image foreground is extracted automatically using a graph-cuts-based binarization. Next, nuclear seed points are detected by a novel method combining multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering constrained by distance-map-based adaptive scale selection. These points are used to perform an initial segmentation that is refined using a second graph-cuts-based algorithm incorporating the method of alpha expansions and graph coloring to reduce computational complexity. Nuclear segmentation results were manually validated over 25 representative images (15 in vitro images and 10 in vivo images, containing more than 7400 nuclei) drawn from diverse cancer histopathology studies, and four types of segmentation errors were investigated. The overall accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm exceeded 86%. The accuracy was found to exceed 94% when only over- and undersegmentation errors were considered. The confounding image characteristics that led to most detection/segmentation errors were high cell density, high degree of clustering, poor image contrast and noisy background, damaged/irregular nuclei, and poor edge information. We present an efficient semiautomated approach to editing automated segmentation results that requires two mouse clicks per operation.",Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Automation;Robustness;Diversity reception;Adaptive filters;Filtering;Computational complexity;In vitro;In vivo;Image cytometry;cell nuclei;histopathology;segmentation,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2009.2035102
High-Speed Nonlinear Interferometric Vibrational Imaging of Biological Tissue With Comparison to Raman Microscopy,"Vibrational contrast imaging of the distribution of complex biological molecules requires the use of techniques that provide broadband spectra with sufficient resolution. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy is currently limited in meeting these requirements due to the presence of a nonresonant background and its inability to target multiple resonances simultaneously. We present nonlinear interferometric vibrational imaging (NIVI), a technique based on CARS that uses femtosecond pump and Stokes pulses to retrieve broadband vibrational spectra over 200 cm-1 (full-width at half maximum). By chirping the pump and performing spectral interferometric detection, the anti-Stokes pulses are resolved in time. This phase-sensitive detection allows suppression of not only the nonresonant background, but also of the real part of the nonlinear susceptibility χ(3), improving the spectral resolution and features to make them comparable to those acquired with spontaneous Raman microscopy, as shown for a material sample and mammary tissue.",Biological tissues;Microscopy;High-resolution imaging;Image resolution;Raman scattering;Resonance;Image retrieval;Chirp;Phase detection;Biological materials;Biological tissue;coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS);interferometry;nonlinear interferometric vibrational imaging (NIVI);optical imaging;spectroscopy,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2035537
Laser-Induced High-Strain-Rate Superplastic 3-D Microforming of Metallic Thin Films,"Microforming of metals has always been a challenge because of the limited formability of metals at the microscale. This paper investigates an innovative microforming technique: microscale laser dynamic forming (¿LDF), which induces 3-D superplastic forming in metallic thin films. This forming process proceeds in a sequence of laser irradiation and ionization of ablative coating, shockwave generation and propagation in metallic thin films, and conformation of metallic thin films to the shape of microscale molds. Because the deformation proceeds at ultrahigh strain rates, it is found that materials experience superplastic deformation at the microscale. In this paper, experiments are systematically carried out to understand the deformation characteristics of ¿LDF. The topologies and dimensions of the deformed samples are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. The thickness variations are characterized by slicing the cross section of the deformed material using the focused ion beam. The magnitude of deformation depth in ¿LDF is determined primarily by three critical factors: film thickness, mold geometry, and laser intensity. The relationships between these factors are explored in process maps to find suitable processing conditions for ¿LDF. Nanoindentation tests are conducted to show that the strength of the thin films is increased significantly after ¿LDF.",Transistors;Optical materials;Optical microscopy;Optical films;Ionization;Coatings;Optical propagation;Shape;Capacitive sensors;Topology;Laser processing;microforming;nanoindentation;shock pressure;superplastic;ultrahigh strain rate forming,ARTICLE,2010,Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems,10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2040947
The Role of Morphology Control in Determining the Performance of P3HT/C-70 Bulk Heterojunction Polymer Solar Cells,"Morphology is one of the critical elements in determining the performance of polymer solar cells. As an important member in fullerene family, unsubstituted C-70 is scarcely employed to prepare polymer solar cells as compared with its derivatives, which is ascribed to its poor solution processability from a single organic solvent. Hereby, we show a method by using mixed solvent to prepare poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/C-70 photoactive layer for high-performance polymer solar cells. Composite films spin coated from the solution with different mixed solvents are characterized by optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, and photovoltaic (PV) device characterization. As a result, heptane/o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) mixture is found to be a good combination to prepare homogenous P3HT/C-70 film, and a high-performance device is thus obtained. By further optimizing the ratio between the donor P3HT and acceptor C-70 in the composite film, the PV cells with a power conversion efficiency of 2.24% have been achieved, which is much higher than that of the device prepared from ODCB-only solution. Dynamic light scattering measurement implies that C-70 molecules form aggregates with size of ~250 nm in ODCB solution, while in heptane/ODCB mixture, the aggregates are much smaller, which is responsible for the homogenous P3HT/C-70 film and also high device performance. This paper demonstrates a vivid approach to control the morphology of polymer solar cells, and thus significantly improved performance via deliberately designed solvent system for thin-film deposition.",Morphology;Heterojunctions;Polymers;Photovoltaic cells;Solvents;Optical microscopy;Optical films;Transmission electron microscopy;Aggregates;Electron optics;Fullerene;mixed solvent;morphology;polymer solar cells,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2042034
Large-scale syntheses of uniform ZnO nanorods and ethanol gas sensors application,"In this paper, we describe a low temperature, solution-based synthesis uniform ZnO nanorods with a gram scale, and their ethanol gas sensor property.

The results showed that the sample had uniform rod-like morphology with a narrow size distribution and highly crystallinity. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra of these nanorods show an exciton emission around 380 nm and a negligible deep-level emission, indicating the nanorods have high quality. The n-type semiconductor gas sensor properties were investigated using a side-heated type structure. The sensor exhibited high sensitivity and fast response to ethanol gas at a work temperature of 400°C. Our results demonstrate the potential application of ZnO nanorods for fabricating highly sensitive gas sensors and ultraviolet laser.",Large-scale systems;Zinc oxide;Ethanol;Gas detectors;Temperature sensors;Optical microscopy;Transmission electron microscopy;Photoluminescence;Electron optics;Stimulated emission,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 3rd International Nanoelectronics Conference (INEC),10.1109/INEC.2010.5425099
"Characterization, cathodoluminescence and field-emission properties of morphology-tunable CdS micro/nanostructures","High-quality, uniform CdS one-dimensional (1D) micro/nanostructures with different morphologies, e.g. microrods, sub-microwires and nanotips, are fabricated through a facile and effective thermal evaporation process. Their structural, cathodoluminescence and field-emission (FE) properties are systematically investigated. Microrods and nanotips exhibit sharp near band edge (NBE) emission and broad deep level (DL) emission, whereas sub-microwires show only the DL emission. A significant decrease in a DL/NBE intensity ratio is observed along a tapered nanotip towards a smaller diameter part. This behavior is understood under consideration of defect concentrations in the nanotips, as analyzed with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Field-emission (FE) measurements show that the nanotips possess best FE characteristics with a relatively low turn-on field of 5.28 V/¿m and the highest field-enhancement factor of 4819 among all 1D CdS nanostructures reported to date. The field-enhancement factor, turn-on and threshold fields are discussed related to structure morphology and vacuum gap variations under emission.",Nanostructures;Iron;Morphology;Scanning electron microscopy;Stimulated emission;Optical microscopy;Nanostructured materials;Transmission electron microscopy;Electron optics;Nonlinear optical devices,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 3rd International Nanoelectronics Conference (INEC),10.1109/INEC.2010.5424574
Effect of oxide layer on Al-induced crystallization of amorphous Si1−xGex thin films,"Metal-induced crystallization (MIC) of amorphous silicon-germanium (a-Si1-xGex) thin films at lower temperature is of considerable importance in photoelectric applications, such as, photovoltaic solar cells, thin film transistors (TFT), larger screen liquid crystal display (LCD), and so on. In this paper, bi-layer Al/a-Si1-xGex thin films on glass substrates were prepared by sputtering deposition, and aluminum oxide layers were involved in some samples. After annealed at 350°C for a long time, the surface morphology, the crystallization degree, the compositional distribution as well as grain sizes of the crystallized SiGe thin films were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy. According to the results, the effect of oxide layers on the Al-induced crystallization of a-Si1-xGex thin films and the accompanying layer exchange were discussed. It was shown that the additional aluminum oxide layers may significantly improve the crystallization of amorphous thin films; a relevant mechanism was suggested to illuminate this phenomenon.",Crystallization;Amorphous materials;Optical microscopy;Thin film transistors;Sputtering;Germanium silicon alloys;Silicon germanium;Aluminum oxide;Grain size;Optical films,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 3rd International Nanoelectronics Conference (INEC),10.1109/INEC.2010.5424907
Distinguishing different stages of mouse pregnancy using Second Harmonic Generation images,"This paper presents an image processing approach for distinguishing three pregnancy stages of mice using Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy images. Three classes of SHG images for day 6, day 12 and day 18 of the 19-day mouse gestation period are considered. A classification is performed based on morphological features previously used for such SHG images, wavelet-based texture features, and a combination of morphological and wavelet-based texture features. It is shown that the combination of the features provide a more effective mechanism for distinguishing the three stages of mouse pregnancy as compared to each separate set of features.",Mice;Pregnancy;Frequency conversion;Biomedical imaging;Microscopy;Pediatrics;Image processing;Feature extraction;Optical harmonic generation;Nonlinear optics;Second harmonic generation imaging;biomedical application;classification;wavelet-based texture features,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 42nd Southeastern Symposium on System Theory (SSST),10.1109/SSST.2010.5442801
Corona aging studies on silicone rubber nanocomposites,"In EHV and UHV power transmission lines, corona could occur even on well designed transmission line hardware and insulators especially under wet conditions. Corona if allowed to occur continuously can significantly damage the polymeric insulators used in such lines in the long run. This paper presents the experimental results of corona aging studies conducted on unfilled silicone rubber as well as filled silicone rubber nanocomposites. Corona aging studies were conducted on silicone rubber samples with filler concentrations of 0, 1, 2 and 3% by wt of nanosilica for 25 h and 50 h. Needleplane electrode geometry has been used to create the corona on the samples. Different characterization techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis, Hydrophobicity, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and Optical Profilometry have been used to assess the relative performance of the samples with respect to corona aging. Results indicate that at 3 wt%, the performance of the nanocomposite is much better than the unfilled silicon rubber which can be attributed to the modifications in the material caused by the size factor of the filler.","Corona;Aging;Rubber;Nanocomposites;Power transmission lines;Optical microscopy;Hardware;Polymers;Plastic insulation;Electrodes;Outdoor insulators, composite polymeric insulators, silicone rubber, nanocomposites, corona, hydrophobicity.

Surface characterization of butterfly wings,"Surface roughness due to micro and nanostructures of butterfly wings create hydrophobic surfaces. In this study, two different experimental techniques were used to characterize the effect of structural features on hydrophobicity of wings. The static and dynamic (advancing and receding) contact angle studies, and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical profilometry characterization were conducted on wings of different butterfly/moth species. Both types of contact angles were shown to be the highest on the butterfly wings that had a combination of both scales and hair like microtrichia. The microtrichia without scales showed almost similar hydrophobicity as on a surface with scales. The role of surface roughness was evaluated by correlating the roughness factor for different scan sizes. It was identified that roughness factor fluctuates rapidly for smaller scan sizes and takes slightly decreasing stable profile for larger scan areas.",Atomic force microscopy;Optical microscopy;Surface morphology;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Atom optics;Scanning electron microscopy;Nanostructures;Atomic measurements;Hair,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE 36th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC),10.1109/NEBC.2010.5458153
Decreased lung carcinoma cell density on select polymer nanometer surface features for lung replacement therapies,"PLGA (poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid) has been widely used as a biomaterial in regenerative medicine due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. The purpose of the present in vitro research was to prepare PLGA films with various nanometer surface features and determine whether lung cancer epithelial cells respond differently to such topographies. Different size polystyrene beads were used to cast poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds which were used as templates to create nano-featured PLGA films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and root mean square (RMS) roughness values indicated that the intended spherical surface nano-topographies on PLGA were formed. A solution evaporation method was also utilized to modify PLGA surface features by using 8 wt% and 4% chloroform solutions. Most importantly, lung cancer epithelial cells adhered less on the PLGA surfaces with RMS values of 0.62, 2.23 and 5.42 nm after 4 hours of culture compared to any other PLGA surface created here. After 3 days, PLGA surfaces with an RMS value of 0.62 nm had much lower cell density than any other sample. In this manner, PLGA with specific nanometer surface features may inhibit lung cancer cell density, providing an important biomaterial for the treatment of lung cancer with wide range of applications.",Lungs;Polymers;Medical treatment;Surface topography;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Cancer;Surface treatment;Atomic force microscopy;Biomedical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE 36th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC),10.1109/NEBC.2010.5458216

Method of Eliminating and Segmenting Ferrographic Images Nonuniform Background,"For most of optical microscopes, the fact that a point light source is adopted results in the nonuniform distribution of illuminance. As a result, for the ferrography image gained using optical microscopy, the image pixels are brighter in the centre than in the edge. Undoubtedly, this will influence significantly the precision of binary image segmentation which is a key step to gain the characterization of wear debris. Therefore, it is very imperative to eliminate the nonuniform distribution of the background brightness of the ferrography image before performing an effective and accurate binary image segmentation. This project is to investigate the elimination of the nonuniform distribution of the background brightness of the ferrographic images in order to gain the accurate binary image of the ferrographic image. Different methods based on the first-order gradient operators, the second-order gradient operators and compensation of the nonuniform distribution of the illumination are developed and their comparison are also presented in the paper. It is believed that the knowledge presented in this paper will be helpful to get the accurate binary image of the ferrographic image which is the foundation of analyzing morphology of wear debris.",Image segmentation;Optical microscopy;Brightness;Light sources;Pixel;Charge coupled devices;Charge-coupled image sensors;Nonlinear optics;Arithmetic;Focusing;Ferrographi Image;Noise;Image Segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 International Conference on Measuring Technology and Mechatronics Automation,10.1109/ICMTMA.2010.793
Application of Microscopic Image Segmentation Technology in Locust-Control Pesticide Research,"The microscopic slice image segmentation of the interacting tissues between locust and bio-pesticide is very important in aspects of illuminating the interactive processes between the locust organs and the bio-pesticide, revealing the infective mechanism of the bio-pesticide to locust, and optimizing the biological agriculture chemical preparation. The classic image segmentation algorithms, such as threshold segmentation, region-growing and edge detection, always result in over-segmentation and edge discontinuity for the microscopic slice images. In this paper, we analyzed the locust soft tissue image's characteristics of complex topology and minimal gray scale difference, exploited the C-V model formulated by level set method to extract the features of image, adjusted the parameters of C-V model and examined their influences in the whole process.

The Research and Exploration of Soft X-Ray Microscopy on the Image Identification System of Squamocellular Cancer of Esophagus,"Nowadays, soft X-Ray microscopy technology is one of the hottest methods that researches and observes the biological samples of natural state, whose resolution is higher than the imaging drawing of optical microscope and near to the imaging drawing of electron microscope. The technology is simple for the preparation of biological sample, which needs only ultramicrocut. And the working procedure of traditional pathology check, such as freezing, sealing wax, dehydration and dyeing, etc. isn't needed. A kind of image recognition system is selected in the paper, which identifies and researches the tissue morphological characteristics of ultrastructure imaging drawing of squamocellular cancer of esophagus obtained by soft X-Ray microscopy. The system mainly consists of components of image preprocessing, image segmentation, cellular feature extraction and cellular feature recognition, etc. Image preprocessing includes grayscale transformation, histogram adjustment, etc. Image segmentation includes segmentation based on the threshold, image processing based on the structure morphology of cell tissue, and edge detection, etc. In cellular feature extraction, the method of extracting area connected is used. And in cellular feature recognition, the judgment of area ratio of nucleus and cytoplasm is adopted.

Statistical pattern analysis of white blood cell nuclei morphometry,"Quantitative microscopy has strengthened conventional diagnostic scheme through better understanding of microscopic features from clinical perspective. Towards this, pathological image analysis has gained immense significance among medical fraternity through visualization and quantitative evaluation of clinical features. Till today pathological inspection of human blood is solely dependent on subjective assessment which usually leads to significant inter-observer variation in grading and subsequently resulting in late diagnosis of certain disease. This paper introduced a systematic approach to morphologically characterize five types of white blood cells (WBC) through statistical pattern analytics. Marker controlled watershed segmentation embedded with morphological operator is employed to segment WBC and its nuclei from light microscopic image of blood samples. Henceforth, one cellular and eight nuclei-based geometric features are computed mathematically and analyzed statistically with t-test and kernel density functions to show their discriminating potentiality among the groups. Amongst all these features, only four statistical significant features are fed to Naïve Bayes classifier for pattern identification with 83.2% overall accuracy.

Automated characterization of sub-epithelial connective tissue cells of normal oral mucosa: Bayesian approach,"The objective of this paper is to develop an automated cell classification system based on Bayesian classifier followed by segmentation using color deconvolution and feature extraction for characterizing various types of sub-epithelial connective tissue (SECT) cells from histological images. In the histological sections of oral mucosa, SECT layer mainly consists of three types of cells - inflammatory, fibroblast and endothelial cells; out of which only first two play significant role pertaining to precancerous changes in oral mucosa. In order to discriminate inflammatory and fibroblast cells, a set of mathematical features viz., area, perimeter, eccentricity, compactness, Zernike moments and Fourier descriptors are extracted followed by cell segmentation using color deconvolution method. The features are statiatically analysed to show its significance in cell discrimination. Thereafter, Bayesian classifier is implemented based on the defined feature space for characterizing inflammatory and fibroblast cells in order to observe the cell distribution in healthy state.

Cell Nuclei and Cytoplasm Joint Segmentation Using the Sliding Band Filter,"Microscopy cell image analysis is a fundamental tool for biological research. In particular, multivariate fluorescence microscopy is used to observe different aspects of cells in cultures. It is still common practice to perform analysis tasks by visual inspection of individual cells which is time consuming, exhausting and prone to induce subjective bias. This makes automatic cell image analysis essential for large scale, objective studies of cell cultures. Traditionally the task of automatic cell analysis is approached through the use of image segmentation methods for extraction of cells' locations and shapes. Image segmentation, although fundamental, is neither an easy task in computer vision nor is it robust to image quality changes. This makes image segmentation for cell detection semi-automated requiring frequent tuning of parameters. We introduce a new approach for cell detection and shape estimation in multivariate images based on the sliding band filter (SBF). This filter's design makes it adequate to detect overall convex shapes and as such it performs well for cell detection. Furthermore, the parameters involved are intuitive as they are directly related to the expected cell size. Using the SBF filter we detect cells' nucleus and cytoplasm location and shapes. Based on the assumption that each cell has the same approximate shape center in both nuclei and cytoplasm fluorescence channels, we guide cytoplasm shape estimation by the nuclear detections improving performance and reducing errors. Then we validate cell detection by gathering evidence from nuclei and cytoplasm channels. Additionally, we include overlap correction and shape regularization steps which further improve the estimated cell shapes. The approach is evaluated using two datasets with different types of data: a 20 images benchmark set of simulated cell culture images, containing 1000 simulated cells; a 16 images Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 dataset containing 1255 cells, stained for DNA and actin. Both image datasets present a difficult problem due to the high variability of cell shapes and frequent cluster overlap between cells. On the Drosophila dataset our approach achieved a precision/recall of 95%/69% and 82%/90% for nuclei and cytoplasm detection respectively and an overall accuracy of 76%.",Shape;Image segmentation;Filters;Image analysis;Microscopy;Fluorescence;Cells (biology);Performance analysis;Inspection;Large-scale systems;Cell segmentation;convergence filters;image processing in biology;multivariate image processing,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2010.2048253
Geometric effects in designing bow-tie nanoantenna for optical resonance investigation,"In this paper, an investigation on the topic of the bow-tie nanoantenna for optical application is carried out. Based on the broad band calculations in the visible and near infrared range of the optical spectrum implemented through the finite integration technique, we focus our study on such nanoantenna's near-field optical properties. It is found that characterized by surface plasmon resonance, highly localized field are found in the gap between the two components of the bow-tie nanoantenna. In addition, such field enhancement is observed to be dependent on the geometric effects, such as the angle and the tip size of the apex, the spacing and the length. A systemic and detailed demonstration of these effects is provided in this study for nanoantenna's design purpose. This bow-tie nanoantenna can be easily combined with the microscope in order to provide a strong light spot for sufficient illumination when probing the near-field properties in microscopy.",Optical design;Geometrical optics;Resonance;Optical sensors;Optical resonators;Optical microscopy;Optical devices;Nanoscale devices;Memory;Integrated optics,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 Asia-Pacific International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility,10.1109/APEMC.2010.5475666

The expression level of SMYD3 was examined by RT-PCR and Western blot. The effects of SMYD3 on proliferation were evaluated by MTT assay. The results showed that the recombinant plasmids were constructed successfully.

Microscopic examination is a time-consuming task for doctors. Therefore, in this study a basic system has been developed that may speed up the eye examination. In future, further development of this system may be an alternative to visual examination. From the basic blood cells (leukocyte, erythrocyte, platelet), we only focused on the locations of white blood cells in the image.

Automatic Best Reference Slice Selection for Smooth Volume Reconstruction of a Mouse Brain From Histological Images,"In this paper, we present a novel and effective method for registering histological slices of a mouse brain to reconstruct a 3-D volume. First, intensity variations in images are corrected through an intensity standardization process so that intensity values remain constant across slices. Second, the image space is transformed to a feature space where continuous variables are taken as high fidelity image features for accurate registration. Third, in order to improve the quality of the reconstructed volume, an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm is developed based on iterative assessment of image entropy and mean square error of the registration process. Fourth, a novel metric for evaluating the quality of the reconstructed volume is developed. Finally, the effect of optimal reference slice selection on the quality of registration and subsequent reconstruction is demonstrated.",Image reconstruction;Mice;Standardization;Permission;Iterative algorithms;Entropy;Mean square error methods;Spatial resolution;Diseases;Pathology;Best reference slice;brain sectioning;histology images;image registration;intensity standardization;reference slice selection;smooth volume reconstruction,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2010.2050594
Detection of nuclei clusters from cervical cancer microscopic imagery using C4.5,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women. At the same time, cervical cancer could be largely preventable and curable with regular Pap tests. This test can find nuclei changes in the cervix. Accurate nuclei detection is extremely critical as it is the previous step of analysing nuclei changes and diagnosis afterwards. In recent years, automatic nuclei segmentation has increased dramatically. Although such algorithms could be utilised in the situation for sparse nuclei since they are intuitively detected, the segmentation for the complicated nuclei clusters is still challenging task. This paper presents a new methodology for the detection of cervical nuclei clusters. We first detect all the nuclei from the cervical microscopic image by an ellipse fitting algorithm. All the ellipses are then classified into single ones and cluster ones by C4.5 decision tree with selected features. We evaluated the performance of this method by the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and cluster predictive value. The result shown that the promising classification accuracy (97.8%) is obtained using C4.5 with 9 relative features.",Cancer detection;Cervical cancer;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Testing;Clustering algorithms;Decision trees;Pathology;Computer vision;Gynaecology;image segmentation;cluster detection;cervical cancer;ellipse detection;decision tree;feature selection,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 2nd International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology,10.1109/ICCET.2010.5485792
Resolving clustered worms via probabilistic shape models,"The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is an effective model system for biological processes such as immunity, behavior, and metabolism. Robotic sample preparation together with automated microscopy and image analysis has recently enabled high-throughput screening experiments using C. elegans. So far, such experiments have been limited to per-image measurements due to the tendency of the worms to cluster, which prevents extracting features from individual animals. We present a novel approach for the extraction of individual C. elegans from clusters of worms in high-throughput microscopy images. The key ideas are the construction of a low-dimensional shape-descriptor space and the definition of a probability measure on it.

Tree2Tree: Neuron segmentation for generation of neuronal morphology,"The knowledge of the structure and morphology of neurons is a central part of our understanding of the brain. There have been concerted efforts in recent years to develop libraries of neuronal structures that can be used for multiple purposes including modeling the brain connectivity and understanding how cellular structure regulates function. However, at present, tracing neuronal structures from microscopy images of neurons is very time consuming and somewhat subjective and therefore not practical for the current datasets. Current automatic state of the art algorithms for neuron tracing fail to work in neuron images which have low contrast, amorphous filament boundaries, branches, and clutter. In this paper, we develop Tree2Tree, a robust automatic neuron segmentation and morphology generation algorithm. It uses a local medial tree generation strategy for visible parts of the neuron and then uses a global tree linking approach to build a maximum likelihood global tree by combining the local trees. Tests on cluttered confocal microscopy images of Drosophila neurons give results that correspond to ground truth within ±5.3 pixel RMSE margin of error.",Neurons;Morphology;Microscopy;Libraries;Brain modeling;Amorphous materials;Robustness;Image segmentation;Joining processes;Testing;Segmentation;neuron tracing;morphology;filament tracking,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490289
Improved automated localization and quantification of protein multiplexes via multispectral fluorescence imaging in heterogenous biopsy samples,"We present a novel improvement of our previously published image analysis system for the automated localization and quantification of protein biomarker expression in immunofluorescence (IF) microscopic images. The improvement has been developed primarily for biopsy based images which are by nature of variable quality and heterogeneous. The innovative method is employed for discriminating the biomarker signal from background, where signal may be the expression of multiple biomarkers or counterstains used in IF. The method is dynamic and it derives a threshold for a true biomarker signal based on the relationship between disease and non-disease tissue components. In addition, a new dynamic range feature construction is presented that is less affected by processing and other variations in tissue. The utility of the approach is demonstrated in predicting, based on the diagnostic biopsy tissue, prostate cancer disease progression within eight years after a radical prostatectomy. For this purpose, androgen receptor (AR) and Ki67 biomarker expression in prostate biopsy samples was quantified and features from the proposed approach were shown to be associated with disease progression in a univariate analysis and manifested improved performance over prior systems. Furthermore, AR and Ki67 features were selected in a multivariate model integrating clinical, histological, and biomarker features, proving their independent prognostic value.",Proteins;Fluorescence;Biopsy;Biomarkers;Diseases;Image analysis;Immune system;Microscopy;Dynamic range;Prostate cancer;Multispectral imaging;biopsy;immunofluorescence microscopy;prostate cancer;prognosis,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490391
Cell segmentation in microscopy imagery using a bag of local Bayesian classifiers,"Cell segmentation in microscopy imagery is essential for many bioimage applications such as cell tracking. To segment cells from the background accurately, we present a pixel classification approach that is independent of cell type or imaging modality. We train a set of Bayesian classifiers from clustered local training image patches. Each Bayesian classifier is an expert to make decision in its specific domain. The decision from the mixture of experts determines how likely a new pixel is a cell pixel.

Segmentation of thalamic nuclei based on tensorial morphological gradient of diffusion tensor fields,"Although thalamic nuclei are not directly visible on conventional anatomical magnetic resonance images (MRI), it is possible to observe differences between the nuclei using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), because of their distinct fiber orientation. This work presents a method to segment the various nuclei of human thalamus using diffusion MRI. Our approach is to use the watershed transform and other concepts from mathematical morphology to segment the nuclei. However, to segment structures using the tensor data produced with DTI (as opposed to scalar images) the concept of a tensorial morphological gradient (TMG) needs to be introduced. Based on the TMG, segmentation of the nuclei of the thalamus was successful using the watershed transform. Our segmentation is consistent with a histological atlas. Since the proposed method, as opposed to the majority of the DTI-based segmentation methods, does not require manual seed and/or surface placement, its results are highly repeatable.",Tensile stress;Image segmentation;Diffusion tensor imaging;Magnetic resonance imaging;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Humans;Surface morphology;Relays;Phased arrays;Diffusion tensor imaging;Segmentation;Tensorial Morphological Gradient;Watershed transform,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490203
Multi-attribute combined mutual information (MACMI): An image registration framework for leveraging multiple data channels,"We present a novel methodological framework for leveraging multiple image sources, including different modalities, acquisition protocols or image features, in the registration of more than two images via information theoretic data fusion. The technique, referred to as multi-attribute combined mutual information (MACMI), adopts a multivariate application of mutual information (MI) to allow several coregistered images to be represented as a single high dimensional multi-attribute image. Our approach improves scenarios involving registration of multiple images as it, (1) utilizes all aligned images obtained in earlier registration steps, (2) improves alignment accuracy compared with pairwise approaches that only consider two images (and hence a fraction of the available data) at a time, and (3) avoids complex optimization problems often associated with fully-groupwise methods. For example, if two coregistered volumes such as T2-weighted and PD-weighted MRI are to be aligned with PET, it is intuitively better to use information from both MR protocols instead of choosing one for registration with PET. In the automated elastic registration of 20 corresponding multiprotocol (T1, T2, PD) synthetic MRI images of the brain with known misalignment of PD MRI, MACMI showed significant improvement in terms of deformation field error over conventional MI-based pairwise registration (p <; 0.05). For a total of 108 corresponding whole-mount histology (WMH), T2 MRI, and DCE (T1) MRI images obtained from 17 prostate specimens with cancer, elastic registration of WMH to bothMRI protocols simultaneously was performed viaMACMI. Improved alignment in terms of prostate overlap and cancer localization was observed using MACMI, compared to pairwise registration of WMH to the individual T2 and DCE MR protocols.",Mutual information;Image registration;Magnetic resonance imaging;Protocols;Cancer;Entropy;Computed tomography;Positron emission tomography;Biomedical engineering;Optimization methods;image registration;MACMI;mutual,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490330
Graph-based morphological processing of multivariate microscopy images and data bases,"The extension of lattice based operators to manifolds is still a challenging theme in mathematical morphology. In this paper, we propose to explicitly construct complete lattices and replace each element of a manifold by its rank suitable for classical morphological processing. Manifold learning is considered as the basis for the construction of a complete lattice. The whole processing of multivariate functions is expressed on graphs to have a formalism that can be applied on images, region adjacency graphs, and image databases.

Piecewise linear cylinder models for 3-dimensional axon segmentation in Brainbow imagery,"Generalized cylinder shapes are ubiquitous in biological systems and image processing techniques to identifies these tubular objects in 3D from biomedical imagery in various modalities is a general problem of interest. One such structure that exhibits branching tubular forms are neuronal networks; specifically, recent developments in microscopy imaging technology allow researchers to acquire massive amounts of 3D color images of neural structures that need to be tracked in 3D to extract structure for the purpose of studying function. In this paper, we propose a piecewise linear generalized cylinder tracing algorithm that exploits both edge and color information in order to automatically trace axons of neurons in Brainbow imagery.

Computer-aided prognosis: Predicting patient and disease outcome via multi-modal image analysis,"Computer-aided prognosis (CAP) is a new and exciting complement to the field of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and involves developing computerized image analysis and multi-modal data fusion algorithms for helping physicians predict disease outcome and patient survival. At the Laboratory for Computational Imaging and Bioinformatics (LCIB) at Rutgers University we have been developing computerized algorithms for high dimensional data and image analysis for predicting disease outcome from multiple modalities including MRI, digital pathology, and protein expression. Additionally, we have been developing novel data fusion algorithms based on nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods (such as Graph Embedding) to quantitatively integrate prognostic information from multiple data sources and modalities. In this paper, we briefly describe 5 representative and ongoing CAP projects at LCIB. These projects include (1) an Image-based Risk Score (IbRiS) algorithm for predicting outcome of ER+ breast cancer patients based on quantitative image analysis of digitized breast cancer biopsy specimens alone, (2) segmenting and determining extent of lymphocytic infiltration (identified as a possible prognostic marker for outcome in Her2+ breast cancers) from digitized histopathology, (3) segmenting and diagnosing highly agressive triple-negative breast cancers on dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, (4) distinguishing patients with different Gleason grades of prostate cancer (grade being known to be correlated to outcome) from digitized needle biopsy specimens, and (5) integrating protein expression measurements obtained from mass spectrometry with quantitative image features derived from digitized histopathology for distinguishing between prostate cancer patients at low and high risk of disease recurrence.",Diseases;Image analysis;Breast cancer;Physics computing;Magnetic resonance imaging;Breast biopsy;Image segmentation;Prostate cancer;Computer aided diagnosis;Coronary arteriosclerosis;computer-aided prognosis (CAP);breast cancer;prostate cancer;personalized medicine;digital pathology;MRI;data fusion;multi-modal,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490264
Computer-Aided Detection of Centroblasts for Follicular Lymphoma Grading Using Adaptive Likelihood-Based Cell Segmentation,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common lymphoid malignancies in the western world. FL has a variable clinical course, and important clinical treatment decisions for FL patients are based on histological grading, which is done by manually counting the large malignant cells called centroblasts (CB) in ten standard microscopic high-power fields from H&E-stained tissue sections. This method is tedious and subjective; as a result, suffers from considerable inter and intrareader variability even when used by expert pathologists. In this paper, we present a computer-aided detection system for automated identification of CB cells from H&E-stained FL tissue samples. The proposed system uses a unitone conversion to obtain a single-channel image that has the highest contrast. From the resulting image, which has a bimodal distribution due to the H&E stain, a cell-likelihood image is generated. Finally, a two-step CB detection procedure is applied. In the first step, we identify evident nonCB cells based on size and shape. In the second step, the CB detection is further refined by learning and utilizing the texture distribution of nonCB cells. We evaluated the proposed approach on 100 region-of-interest images extracted from ten distinct tissue samples and obtained a promising 80.7% detection accuracy.",Cancer;Image segmentation;Image texture analysis;Microscopy;Pathology;Biomedical informatics;Image color analysis;Medical treatment;Image converters;Image generation;Biomedical image analysis;cell segmentation;follicular lymphoma (FL);H&E-stained tissue;histology,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2010.2055058
Use of imperfectly segmented nuclei in the classification of histopathology images of breast cancer,"Many features used in the analysis of pathology imagery are inspired by grading features defined by clinical pathologists as important for diagnosis and characterization. A large majority of these features are features of cell nuclei; as such, there is often the desire to segment the imagery into individual nuclei prior to feature extraction and further analysis. In this paper we present an analysis of the utility of imperfectly segmented cell nuclei for classification of H&E stained histopathology imagery of breast tissue. We show the object- and image-level classification performance using these imperfectly segmented nuclei in a benign versus malignant decision. Results indicate that very good classification accuracies can be achieved with imperfectly segmented nuclei and further that perfect nuclei segmentation does not necessarily guarantee better classification accuracy.",Image segmentation;Breast cancer;Image analysis;Image converters;Pathology;Breast tissue;Immune system;Wavelength conversion;Pixel;Testing;Histopathology;medical image analysis;nuclei segmentation;breast cancer;H&E,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,"2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing",10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495124

6.6: Emission imaging of a single crystal LaB6 cathode surface,"LaB6 cathode is still the emitter of choice in a variable-shape beam (VSB) electron beam lithography tool. In commercial LaB6 cathodes, the (100) crystalline plane is used as the emissive surface. Typical size of emitter is ~70 μm DIA. Though generally stable, this crystalline plane is sensitive to residual atmosphere, and it may have microscopic defects (inclusions, dislocations, etc.) which appear and evolve over the time. Routine initial microscopic inspection of LaB6 cathodes gives us an initial optical/SEM image of surface, which may change during cathode life. With a simple technique, we have obtained LaB6 cathode emission images, which showed features unavailable to optical and electron microscopy. This technique can be used for LaB6 quality evaluation during standard cathode test runs.",Cathodes;Scanning electron microscopy;Optical microscopy;Crystallization;Electron beams;Electron optics;Stimulated emission;Optical sensors;Optical imaging;Lithography;LaB6 cathode;e-beam lithography;emission imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE International Vacuum Electronics Conference (IVEC),10.1109/IVELEC.2010.5503594
Scratch Types and Damage Thresholds of Fused Silica,"Atom force microscopy (AFM) is used to investigate micro-morphology of various types of scratches in the fused silica surface and sub-surface. Based on the shape, scratches can be classified as lateral scratch, radial scratch, Hertizan cone scratch, and trailing indent scratch. From forming mechanism, scratches can be classified as plastic scratch, brittle scratch and mixed scratch. The statistical damage thresholds of three kinds of common scratches are obtained through raster scanning at different laser fluences. The results show that the damage threshold of radial scratches is the highest and that of the trailing indent scratches is the lowest. In addition, for the samples etched in different concentration buffered hydrofluoric acid solutions for different etching time, the damage thresholds are also obtained. The high concentration and long-time etching can effectively enhance the damage threshold of scratches. Brittle scratches are easier to damage than plastic scratches. Two kinds of mechanisms are responsible for the laser damage: local electrical intensification and mechanical weakness induced by scratches. This work is a reference for further investigation on damage threshold enhancement and damage mechanism of scratches in fused silica.",Silicon compounds;Etching;Atomic force microscopy;Optical microscopy;Hafnium;Shape;Testing;Laser modes;Optical buffering;Surface morphology,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 Symposium on Photonics and Optoelectronics,10.1109/SOPO.2010.5504301

Synthesis and Optical Properties of ZnO Nanowires for Nanophotonics,"One-dimensional nanostructures, especially semi-conductor nanowires, have been an on-going research topic due to their peculiar optical and physical properties, and their potential for a wide range of the applications in electronics, photonics, and magnetic devices. Such nanostructures can also serve as template matrices for nanoscale sensors. Zinc oxide (ZnO), with its wide bandgap and large exciton binding energy, is a promising semiconductor material for optical devices such as solid state lighting and photovoltaics. ZnO nanowires have recently attracted tremendous interest because of the possibility to combine the unique optical characteristics of ZnO at the nanoscale. However, realizing well aligned nanowires has remained challenging, with various shapes and orientations being reported. The resulting optical properties have not been thoroughly correlated with the shape, orientation and growth parameters of the nanowires. We report here the growth of ZnO nanowires by chemical vapor deposition using both a catalyst-assisted vapor-liquid-solid and a catalyst-free vapor-solid deposition approach.

"Practical Measurements of Stiffness, Displacement, and Comb Drive Force of MEMS","We present the first practical measurements of stiffness and comb drive force of a micro electro mechanical system (MEMS). Compared to previous efforts, our method is easier to implement, faster to perform, and lower in cost. Our method provides direct quantification of the uncertainty of a single measurement. Our method is amenable to automated industrial-level batch probing or on-chip post-packaged measurements. In this paper, we test our method with using several MEMS on difference dies that were fabricated in the standard SOIMUMPs foundry process. Our planar geometry measurements compare favorably to optical and electron microscopy, with an uncertainty on the order of nanometers. Our measurements of comb drive force are a function of voltage and capacitance only and are thusly traceable. With our current test bed, our uncertainty in force is on the order of nanonewtons with lots of room for improvement. Our measurement of stiffness is obtained from our measurements of force and deflection. We also discuss the theory of our methodology.",Force measurement;Displacement measurement;Drives;Micromechanical devices;Testing;Optical microscopy;Mechanical variables measurement;Mechanical systems;Costs;Foundries,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 18th Biennial University/Government/Industry Micro/Nano Symposium,10.1109/UGIM.2010.5508908
In Vivo Simultaneous Morphological and Biochemical Optical Imaging of Oral Epithelial Cancer,"Early detection of cancer is key to reducing morbidity and mortality. Morphological and chemical biomarkers presage the transition from normal to cancerous tissue. We have developed a noninvasive imaging system incorporating optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) into a single optical system for the first time, in order to acquire both sets of biomarkers. OCT can provide morphological images of tissue with high resolution, while FLIM can provide biochemical tissue maps. Coregistered OCT volumes and FLIM images have been acquired simultaneously in an in vivo hamster cheek pouch model of oral cancer. The OCT images indicate morphological biomarkers for cancer including thickening of the epithelial layer and loss of the layered structure. The FLIM images indicate chemical biomarkers including increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and reduced collagen emission. While both sets of biomarkers can differentiate normal and cancerous tissue, we believe their combination will enable the discrimination of benign lesions possessing some of the indicated biomarkers, e.g., scarring or inflammation.",Optical imaging;Biomarkers;Chemicals;High-resolution imaging;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical microscopy;Cancer detection;Tomography;Fluorescence;Image resolution;Cancer diagnosis;fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM);molecular imaging;multimodality imaging;optical coherence tomography (OCT),ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2010.2060485
Segmenting Clustered Nuclei Using H-minima Transform-Based Marker Extraction and Contour Parameterization,"In this letter, we present a novel watershed-based method for segmentation of cervical and breast cell images. We formulate the segmentation of clustered nuclei as an optimization problem. A hypothesis concerning the nuclei, which involves a priori knowledge with respect to the shape of nuclei, is tested to solve the optimization problem. We first apply the distance transform to the clustered nuclei. A marker extraction scheme based on the H -minima transform is introduced to obtain the optimal segmentation result from the distance map. In order to estimate the optimal h-value, a size-invariant segmentation distortion evaluation function is defined based on the fitting residuals between the segmented region boundaries and fitted models. Ellipsoidal modeling of contours is introduced to adjust nuclei contours for more effective analysis. Experiments on a variety of real microscopic cell images show that the proposed method yields more accurate segmentation results than the state-of-the-art watershed-based methods.",Image segmentation;Image analysis;Microscopy;Merging;Materials science and technology;Permission;Breast;Shape;Testing;Clustering algorithms;Cell image segmentation;contour parameterization;H-minima transform;marker extraction;watershed-based segmentation,ARTICLE,2010,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2010.2060336

Analysis of SGC-7901 Apoptosis Induced by CSBE and Regulating Gene Expression with Laser Scanning Microscopy and Immunofluorescence Flow Cytometry Technique,"The purpose of this article was to observe interaction between drug and cancer cell with fluorescence probes and molecular imaging technology. In order to study the effect of cell growth and apoptosis morphology of Human gastric adenocarcinoma SGC-7901 induced by n-butanol extract from Capparis spionosa L. (CSBE), laser scanning microscopy was employed to observe apoptosis imaging. In addition, the protein expression and mRNA expression of its regulating gene Bcl-2 and Bax were detected. Laser scanning microscope imaging showed cells that have bound Annexin V-FITC were in early period of apoptosis, which will show green staining in the plasma membrane. The cells that have lost membrane integrity will show red staining (PI) throughout the nucleus and a halo of green staining (FITC) on the cell surface (plasma membrane). The necrosis cells were stained by PI only. In the western blot test, CSBE could decrease the expression of Bcl-2 protein and the rate of inhibition increased as the concentration of drug rised. The immunofluorescence flow cytometry technique found that CSBE could increase the expression of Bax protein in a dose-dependent manner. Thus the rate of Bcl-2/Bax was reduced. The result of RT-PCR showed that CSBE could down-regulate the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 gene, and up-regulate the mRNA expression of Bax gene, which meant that it was by regulating gene transcription level.

Learning the topological properties of brain tumors,"This work presents a graph-based representation (a.k.a., cell-graph) of histopathological images for automated cancer diagnosis by probabilistically assigning a link between a pair of cells (or cell clusters). Since the node set of a cell-graph can include a cluster of cells as well as individual ones, it enables working with low-cost, low-magnification photomicrographs. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it is shown that without establishing a pairwise spatial relation between the cells (i.e., the edges of a cell-graph), neither the spatial distribution of the cells nor the texture analysis of the images yields accurate results for tissue level diagnosis of brain cancer called malignant glioma. Second, this work defines a set of global metrics by processing the entire cell-graph to capture tissue level information coded into the histopathological images. In this work, the results are obtained on the photomicrographs of 646 archival brain biopsy samples of 60 different patients. It is shown that the global metrics of cell-graphs distinguish cancerous tissues from noncancerous ones with high accuracy (at least 99 percent accuracy for healthy tissues with lower cellular density level, and at least 92 percent accuracy for benign tissues with similar high cellular density level such as nonneoplastic reactive/inflammatory conditions).",Neoplasms;Cancer;Logistics;Pixel;Fractals;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Biopsy;Machine learning;Graph theory;Index Terms- Image representation;machine learning;model development;graph theory;medical information systems.,ARTICLE,2005,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2005.42

Functional modeling for liver imaging and nodule characterization,"In this paper, we propose to use functional modeling to extract physiological characteristics from dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI. The clinical objective is to independently compute the two vascular supplies of the liver, coming from hepatic artery and portal vein. These supplies are progressively modified in hepatocarcinogenesis, and their assessment can be useful for nodule characterization. A first physiological microscopic model of liver vascularization, allows simulating the evolution of the contrast material concentration. After comparison of simulated and real curves, a simplified version of this model is used to extract arterial and portal perfusion parameters, in normal case and in hepatic nodules.

Detecting algorithm based Gabor in microscopic image,"It is very important to identify the pathology components of urine solution and acquire a result of clinical examination. It aids to diagnose diseases of the urology system. Because the particles such as urinary sediments are irregular in shape and fuzzy in edge, it is much more difficult to automatically detect particles in microscopic images. Texture segmentation involves subdividing an image into differently textured regions. Many segmentation based on Gabor filters are derived from Gabor elementary functions. We present a new robust method for the problem of automatically detecting the particles' location in images. We have devised a more rigorously Gabor-based method enhancing the edge information for designing Gabor filters. We argue that Gabor filter outputs can be modeled as Gaussian's and develop a new algorithm for selecting optimal filter parameters.",Microscopy;Gabor filters;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Pathology;Diseases;Sediments;Shape;Robustness;Gaussian processes;Gabor-based filter;segmentation;detecting particles;microscopic image,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,2005 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics,10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527900
Directional beaming by interaction of dielectric nano surface structure and metal: design for fabrication of nanowriter optical head,"The extraordinary transmission phenomenon has stimulated much interest in recent years. Based on the extraordinary transmission and directional beaming phenomena proposed by Ebbesen et al., a new optical head structures, nonmetal optical head, are presented in this letter. Nonmetal optical head composed of dielectric surface grating on a metallic thin film was proposed. We also offer the physical origin for the directional beaming of light emerging from a single subwavelength slit in the metallic film that has dielectric grating feature on the exit side. Both of experiments and numerical simulations were implemented, and they were shown eventually to agree with this surface plasmon diffraction very well. The main reason for designing nonmetal optical head proposed in this letter is for mass production possibilities of nanoimprint technique. It is very important to know the mechanism which drives the directional beaming phenomenon for nonmetal optical head. Therefore, a design rule for desired nonmetal optical head is presented. Another novel optical design proposed is double slits optical head. Light emerging from the two slits cross at the desired focal length, which is decided by the distance between the two slits. Also, two light beam interference to become a subwavelength light beam. Various applications may appear because of the understanding of this nano-optics device, from this design, for example, an optical switch or an optical sensor, optical lithography, optical storage, and optical microscopy, and so on.",Surface structures;Optical design;Optical device fabrication;Optical films;Optical sensors;Stimulated emission;Dielectric thin films;Optical devices;Gratings;Optical microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,"IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics, 2005.

Automatic scene comparison and matching in multimodal cytopathological microscopic images,"The potential of cytopathologic diagnoses to detect cancer of a variety of types non-invasively, cost-efficiently and up to three years ahead of conventional histopathologic diagnoses can be increased by the application of adjuvant methods, i.e. the combination of different stainings. For further improvement of cytopathology we introduced multimodal cell analysis (MMCA) which combines specific information about identical cells in different stainings successively applied to the same microscope slide. This requires a precise relocation and coregistration of individual cells under scrutiny. As a precondition for application in daily routine and screening settings the crucial relocation of cells has to be automated. The paper describes a method for an automatic retrieval of images of cells which have already been selected and recorded in a preceding staining together with their coordinates. Due to inevitable mechanical inaccuracies the geometric match is insufficient. The comparison of nuclear constellations based on segmentations in both stains facilitates an automatic correction of the position even if there is a subscene matching only. The process furthermore generates the initial guess for the succeeding coregistration which thereby gains robustness. The success rate of the method described is about 85%.",Layout;Microscopy;Cancer detection;Robustness;Computer vision;Application software;Information analysis;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Nuclear power generation,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005,10.1109/ICIP.2005.1529958

Bioinformatics advances in neuron imaging,"Exploring the role of neuron's morphological change in brain function or neurological disorders is a long-time goal in many neuroscience fields. The arrival of digital microscopy, such as two-photon and confocal laser scanning microscopy, coupled with a large arsenal of fluorescent and other labeling methods to study the neuron 3D structure and dynamics in cell culture, brain tissue culture, and even live animals, has become a powerful technique that allows the neuroscientists to gather objective, quantitative and reproducible cell-based phenotype information. It offers tremendous value to localize, identify and characterize brain cells and subcellular components at different animal models. It enables better understanding of cellular changes underlying the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. Nevertheless, there are significant bioinformatics challenges in processing, managing, analyzing, modeling, and mining large volumes of multi-dimensional neuronal images generated by high resolution optical microscopy in studying dynamic neuronal information. The existing bioimaging tools are extremely limited in their scope and capacity. The scientists have to rely on slow and restrictive manual analysis to extract information. Image informatics has become the rate-limiting factor in neuroscience imaging studies. We aim to fill this gap by developing an image informatics platform, neuronal image quantitator (NeuronIQ), with increased capacity to identify and track neuronal objects and to analyze and quantitate object features extracted from the large amounts of images generated by optical microscopy, providing a complete picture of the evolution of the morphological features and behaviors of neurons and related cellular objects in time and space, and under different experimental conditions. This would lead to rapid cell-based assays to obtain and analyze broad ranges of neuronal phenotypes and facilitate the extraction of previously undecipherable information from neuronal morphology.

Effect of Mg on the Microstructure and Properties of Sn-Ag-Cu Lead-free Solder,"In this paper, a SnAgCuMg solder alloy system was developed considering its potential as a direct substitute for Sn-Pb solder for electronic assembly. Ingots with additive 1%, 3% and 5% (wt) Mg to an eutectic Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu alloy were cast by means of a resistance furnace. To reduce the oxidation tendency of magnesium during melting and casting process, a special device was employed. The melting characteristic of SnAgCuMg solders was evaluated and compared with Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu alloy by differential thermal analysis (DTA). The microstructure observation was carried out by means of optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It showed that SnAgCu solder tends to melt at lower temperature with the addition of Mg. Without typical Ag3Sn/β-Sn eutectic microstructure, SnAgCuMg solders present different microstructures from eutectic Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu.

Imaging single fluorophores at very high resolution by near-field optical microscopy,"A new probe for scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) that exploits field concentration at a metal tip allows to image single dye molecules at a resolution far beyond the diffraction limit. This probe combines the high resolution of the apertureless SNOM with the single molecule sensitivity of the aperture SNOM. An image of single Cy-3 fluorophores covalently attached to the termini of DNA. In fluorescence, the dyes appear as characteristic patterns with details of 10 nm in width. The patterns indicate field concentration at the metal tip and simultaneously fluorescence quenching. Modeling of the data allows determining the position of the dyes at sub-nm accuracy and, at the same time, the 3-D orientation of the dyes. As an important feature of our probe, the metal tip simultaneously provides high-resolution topographic imaging. The evaluation of two independent co-localized signals (fluorescence and topography) allows a much clearer interpretation of the sample than possible with one signal alone.

Near field terahertz imaging and spectroscopy,"In this presentation, we present our THZ ANSOM and characterisation of the system of generation and detection of terahertz waves. Recent reports show a great potential of apertureless near-field scanning optical microscopy (ANSOM or ASNOM) applied to terahertz (THz) frequency domain, also called far infrared domain (0.1 to 10 THz). THz imaging brings an improved optical contrast that enables the identification of unique rotational and vibrational responses of various materials within this frequency range. But main drawback of THz imaging is weak resolution of images, limited by diffraction. We have also developed a spectroscopic system based on an interferometric technique. It is possible to record the linear autocorrelation of the terahertz electric field by scanning the optical path between the two arms of a Michelson interferometer. The terahertz spectrum is then obtained by numerical computation of the Fourier transform. For each point of the 2D near field image, one can reach a spectroscopic information.

Integrated optical nanoprobe sensor implemented using a mixed technology CMOS fabrication process,"It has been shown that a sub-wavelength nanoprobe (consisting of a sharpened optical fiber with a nanoscale optical aperture) can be used to produce microscopy images with spatial resolutions smaller than the optical wavelength. While these optical devices have been available for a decade, there use in near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) systems is limited by the nonuniformity of the probe fabrication process, and the complexity of the signal processing and control electronics. Recently, a new MEMS based probe fabrication process was developed that enables the production of nanoprobes with uniform and repeatable physical and optical characteristics. In this paper we investigate the possibility of integrating a nanoprobe with a CMOS based signal processing circuitry. When coupled with the new optical nanoprobes, this technology could potentially be used in the design and implementation of a compact NSOM system and thus enable the cost effective introduction of NSOM technology into a new set of applications including biomedical imaging and ultra high density data storage. Fabricated using an AMI 1.5 /spl mu/m CMOS process, the core of this project involves the design and fabrication of a CMOS chip that includes four different CMOS photoreceiver circuits V-grooves which are fabricated using a MEMS based post process etching step. The V-grooves are used for passive alignment of optical nanoprobes with the on-chip CMOS based photodetectors which are realized using the N-well/P-substrate junction. This photodiode has been used in all four types of the photoreceiver circuits in order to accommodate nW optical input signals. Based on recent development of CMOS photosensor technology, two types of active pixel and two types of passive pixel circuits have been designed. All four circuits are based on charging/discharging a capacitor to perform integration of the photogenerated current. If the integration process is linear and charging/discharging current I is a constant a simple relationship of /spl Delta/V//spl Delta/t = I/C should be satisfied. For maximum possible /spl Delta/V of 5 volts, there exists a maximum allowable sampling period for specific value of the charging/discharging current and integration capacitor. Unfortunately, in each circuit the value of charging/discharging current and total capacitance including parasitic capacitances are hard to determine. According to the T-SPICE simulation, a comparison of maximum allowable sampling period vs. photocurrent for four different photoreceiver circuits laid out is presented. Photoreceiver circuit evaluation and comparison have also done experimentally by using both the packaged and unpackaged die. Following the experimental confirmation that the photoreceiver circuits function as designed, the unpackaged die is post processed to produce the V-groove structures, and circuit evaluations are again done to access any performance degradation resulting from the post processing step. Finally, nanoprobes are attached into the V-grooves and the performance of the integrated optical nanoprobe with CMOS photoreceiver circuitry is evaluated.",Optical sensors;CMOS technology;Integrated optics;CMOS process;Optical device fabrication;Circuits;Optical signal processing;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical microscopy;Optical devices,INPROCEEDINGS,2005,"48th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2005.",10.1109/MWSCAS.2005.1594216

Study of microstructure and properties of laser cladding TiC-H13 composite coating,"As one kind of excellent hot-working die steel, H13 has been widely used. But the surface failure was usually found which can decrease the service life. In this paper, TiC ceramic powders were introduced to strengthen H13 steel by continuous wave CO2 laser cladding. The macro surface quality and microstructures was investigated by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Thermal stability and anti-wear performance were measured. TiC was uniformly dispersed in the coating. But the morphologies of TiC in the cladding coating were different for temperature gradient during laser cladding. Near the surface of cladding coating, TiC have been partially molten shown as dendritic structure while in the cladding coating was irregular shape such as subrounded or rhombic.

Heterogeneous Conditional Random Field: Realizing joint detection and segmentation of cell regions in microscopic images,"Detecting and segmenting cell regions in microscopic images is a challenging task, because cells typically do not have rich features, and their shapes and appearances are highly irregular and flexible. Furthermore, cells often form clusters, rendering the existing joint detection and segmentation algorithms unable to segment out individual cells. We address these difficulties by proposing a Heterogeneous Conditional Random Field (HCRF), in which different nodes have different state sets. The state sets are designed in such a way that the resulting HCRF model could encode all possible detection/segmentation cases while keeping its identifiability and compactness. Attributed to the provably optimal design of the state sets, the proposed model successfully realizes joint detection and segmentation of the cell regions into individual cells whether the cells are separate or touch one another. Experiments on two different types of cell images show that the HCRF outperforms several recently proposed methods.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Clustering algorithms;Shape;Object detection;Robots;Muscles;Stem cells;Inference algorithms;Iterative algorithms,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540037
Finding dots: Segmentation as popping out regions from boundaries,Many applications need to segment out all small round regions in an image. This task of finding dots can be viewed as a region segmentation problem where the dots form one region and the areas between dots form the other. We formulate it as a graph cuts problem with two types of grouping cues: short-range attraction based on feature similarity and long-range repulsion based on feature dissimilarity. The feature we use is a pixel-centric relational representation that encodes local convexity: Pixels inside the dots and outside the dots become sinks and sources of the feature vector. Normalized cuts on both attraction and repulsion pop out all the dots in a single binary segmentation. Our experiments show that our method is more accurate and robust than state-of-art segmentation algorithms on four categories of microscopic images. It can also detect textons in natural scene images with the same set of parameters.,Image segmentation;Microscopy;Silicon;Robustness;Embryo;Auditory system;Cancer;Educational institutions;Layout;Biomedical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540210
Two-point correlation as a feature for histology images: Feature space structure and correlation updating,"The segmentation of tissues in whole-slide histology images is a necessary step for the morphological analyses of tissues and cellular structures. Previous works have demonstrated the potential of two-point correlation functions (TPCF) as features for tissue segmentation, however the feature space is not yet well understood and computational methods are lacking. This paper illustrates several fundamental aspects of TPCF feature space and contributes a fast algorithm for deterministic feature computation. Despite the high-dimensionality of TPCF feature space, the features corresponding to different tissues are shown to be characterized by low-dimensional manifolds. The relationship between TPCF and the familiar co-occurrence matrix is highlighted, and it is shown that costly cross correlations are not necessary to achieve an accurate segmentation. For computation, the method of correlation updating, based on the linearity of the correlation operator, is proposed and shown to achieve up to a 67X speedup over frequency domain computation methods.

Clustering nuclei using machine learning techniques,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women. Meanwhile, cervical cancer could be largely preventable and curable with regular Pap tests. Nuclei changes in the cervix could be found by this test. Accurate nuclei detection is extremely critical as it is the previous step of analysing nuclei changes and diagnosis afterwards. Recently, computer-aided nuclei segmentation has increased dramatically. Although such algorithms could be utilised in the situation for sparse nuclei since they are intuitively detected, the segmentation for the complicated nuclei clusters is still challenging task. This paper presents a new methodology for the detection of cervical nuclei clusters. We first detect all the nuclei from the cervical microscopic image by an ellipse fitting algorithm. Second, we chose some high-relevant features from all the features we obtained in last step via F-score, which is based on to what extent one feature attributes to results. All the ellipses are then classified into single ones and cluster ones by C4.5 decision tree with selected features. We evaluated the performance of this method by the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and cluster predictive value.

Computer aided abnormality detection for cervical smear is developed to assist medical experts to handle the microscopy images, examine cell abnormalities and diagnose dyskaryosis. The microscopy images of cells in cervix uteri are stained by the tumor marker Ki-67, so that the abnormal nuclei present brown while normal ones are bluish. Segmentation is the most important and difficult task to calculate the ratio of abnormal nuclei to all nuclei. In order to achieve accurate segmentation of nuclei, we propose a multi-level segmentation approach for abnormality identification in microscopy images. First level segmentation aims to partition abnormal (stained) nuclei regions and all nuclei regions. Because of under-segmentation after first level segmentation, second level segmentation is applied to further partition the clustered nuclei. In order to classify touching regions of clustered nuclei and separate regions of single nucleus, relevant meaningful features are extracted from regions of interest. Consequently all the nuclei regions are separated and in conjunction with the abnormal nuclei regions in the first level segmentation, the abnormality i.e. ratio of abnormal nuclei to all nuclei is obtained. Experimental results indicate that our method achieved an accuracy of 93.55% and 95.8% in term of abnormal nuclei and all nuclei respectively for identification of abnormalities. Our proposed method produces a satisfactory segmentation.",Artificial neural networks;Image segmentation;Equations;Australia,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering,10.1109/ICCME.2010.5558872
Detecting immature precursor cells in pathological images of bone marrow based on morphology,"It is an effective means for the early diagnosis of leukemia to study immature precursor cells in marrow pathological images by computer image processing technology.

An efficient casts recognition algorithm in urinary sediment images,"A new and efficient method for casts recognition in urinary sediment microscopic images is proposed in this paper. It combines the shape and texture characteristics of casts, and accordingly, consists of two steps. In the first step, the casts' tube-like shape feature is expressed by a modified method stems from the traditional one which is based on the minimum bounding rectangle(MBR). Instead of using MBR, we make use of the centerline to describe its shape while curved casts are concerned. Then, in the next step, some texture features are extracted and send to the SVM classifier for further judgment. As this method is quite focus on the features of casts, both shape and texture, it is very effective to recognize casts in urinary sediment images. Large experiments proved that this method is easy to implement and achieves high accuracy.",Shape;Sediments;Feature extraction;Image recognition;Pattern recognition;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Cast;Urinary sediment;Centerline;SVM,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576450

Progress and perspectives in digital holographic microscopy applied to life sciences,"Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is a technique that allows obtaining, from a single recorded hologram, quantitative phase image of living cell with interferometric accuracy. Specifically the optical phase shift induced by the specimen on the transmitted wave front can be regarded as a powerful endogenous contrast agent, depending on both the thickness and the refractive index of the sample. The quantitative phase images allow the derivation of highly relevant cell parameters, including dry mass density and spatial distribution. Thanks to a decoupling procedure, cell thickness and intracellular refractive index can be measured separately. Consequently, cell morphology, shape as well as cell membrane fluctuations can be accurately monitor. As far as red blood cell are considered, Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), two highly relevant clinical parameters, have been measured non-invasively at a single cell level. The DHM nanometric axial and microsecond temporal sensitivities have permitted to measure the red blood cell membrane fluctuations (CMF) over the whole cell surface. In addition, the development of live-cell multimodality microscope combining fluorescence with digital holographic microscopy is presented. The biophysical cell parameters derived from the quantitative phase information in combination with the numerous different specific fluorescent cellular probes allow to this multimodality microscope to address various important issues in cell biology.",Microscopy;Image reconstruction;Fluorescence;Fluctuations;Biomembranes;Optical microscopy;Refractive index,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 9th Euro-American Workshop on Information Optics,10.1109/WIO.2010.5582513
Determination of chemo-responses for osteosarcoma using a hybrid evolutionary algorithm,"In this paper, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) based on the approaches of the evolutionary algorithm and a local search (LS) is proposed to determine the gene signatures for predicting histologic response of chemotherapy on osteosarcoma patients, which is one of the most common malignant bone tumor in children. The HEA consists of a population of individuals but the evolution of individuals is conducted by a LS, rather than the crossover and mutation used in the traditional evolutionary algorithms. The proposed HEA can simultaneously optimize the feature subset and the classifier through a common solution coding mechanism.

Combined Technologies in Analysis of Overlapping Cells,"Time-lapse microscopy imaging serves as an important method to measure the cycle progression of individual cells in a large population. The lacking of automatic systems that can deal with large volume of time-lapse optical microscopy imaging is a bottleneck of modern bio-imaging research. In this paper we present an effective computerized method for overlapping cell nuclei detection in time-lapse image sequences. We design a two-stage detection scheme for such cells in each image of the image sequence. Features of the skeleton and the contour of the cell model are extracted in the two stages, and overlapped cells are detected by the similarity of the features with the training samples.

Prion protein and human cognition,"Prion protein (PrP) is probably the only known infectious protein that possesses chameleon-like features, as reflected not only in its conformation but also in its function. Cellular PrP (PrPC), rich in α-helical structures, is believed to be functionally involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, immune cell activation, cell adhesion, signal transduction, copper metabolism, antioxidant activity, and programmed cell death. Its pathologic conformer (PrPSc), rich in β-sheet structures, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, a group of age-related transmissible neurodegenerative disorders which, as in Alzheimer's disease, inevitably attack human cognition. Histologically, PrP is highly concentrated in the central nervous system although it is also widely expressed in the peripheral tissues and organs at lower levels. Observations indicating that a pronounced cognitive deficit is often evident in the early stage of prion diseases strongly imply that PrP is associated with human cognition. Indeed, cognitive deficit is one of a few phenotypes identified in mice lacking PrP. This article highlights evidence of the involvement of PrPC in human cognition. In addition, it puts forth the hypothesis that two potential PrP-implicated pathways are operative in human cognition.",Proteins;Diseases;Humans;Mice;Cognition;Iron;Prion protein;prion diseases;cognition;cognitive deficit;insoluble prion protein;Alzheimer's disease;dementia;memory,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,9th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics (ICCI'10),10.1109/COGINF.2010.5599805

Local and global Gaussian mixture models for hematoxylin and eosin stained histology image segmentation,"This paper presents a new algorithm for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology image segmentation. With both local and global clustering, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are applied sequentially to extract tissue constituents such as nuclei, stroma, and connecting contents from background. Specifically, local GMM is firstly applied to detect nuclei by scanning the input image, which is followed by global GMM to separate other tissue constituents from background. Regular RGB (red, green and blue) color space is employed individually for the local and global GMMs to make use of the H&E staining features. Experiments on a set of cervix histology images show the improved performance of the proposed algorithm when compared with traditional K-means clustering and state-of-art multiphase level set methods.",Image segmentation;Level set;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Joining processes;Clustering algorithms;Pixel;Gaussian mixture model;histology;image segmentation;clustering,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 10th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems,10.1109/HIS.2010.5600019
Learning cellular texture features in microscopic cancer cell images for automated cell-detection,"In this paper we present a new approach for automated cell detection in single frames of 2D microscopic phase contrast images of cancer cells which is based on learning cellular texture features. The main challenge addressed in this paper is to deal with clusters of cells where each cell has a rather complex appearance composed of sub-regions with different texture features. Our approach works on two different levels of abstraction. First, we apply statistical learning to learn 6 different types of different local cellular texture features, classify each pixel according to them and we obtain an image partition composed of 6 different pixel categories. Based on this partitioned image we decide in a second step if pre-selected seeds belong to the same cell or not.

Airborne asbestos fibers detection in microscope images using re-initialization free active contours,"Breathing in asbestos fibers can lead to a number of diseases, the fibers become trapped in the lung and cannot be removed by either coughing or the person's immune system. Atmospheric concentrations of carcinogenic asbestos fibers, have traditionally been measured visually using phase contrast microscopy. However, because this measurement method requires great skill, and has poor reproducibility and objectivity, the development of automatic counting methods has been long anticipated. In this paper we proposed an automated fibers detection method based on a variational formulation of geometric active contours that forces the level set function to be close to signed distance function and therefore completely eliminates the need of the costly re-initialization procedure. The method was evaluated using a ground truth of 29 manually annotated images. The results were encouraging for the further development of the proposed method.",Image segmentation;Histograms;Active contours;Level set;Microscopy;Shape;Approximation methods,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology,10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626630
Boosting instance prototypes to detect local dermoscopic features,"Local dermoscopic features are useful in many dermoscopic criteria for skin cancer detection. We address the problem of detecting local dermoscopic features from epiluminescence (ELM) microscopy skin lesion images. We formulate the recognition of local dermoscopic features as a multi-instance learning (MIL) problem. We employ the method of diverse density (DD) and evidence confidence (EC) function to convert MIL to a single-instance learning (SIL) problem. We apply Adaboost to improve the classification performance with support vector machines (SVMs) as the base classifier. We also propose to boost the selection of instance prototypes through changing the data weights in the DD function. We validate the methods on detecting ten local dermoscopic features from a dataset with 360 images. We compare the performance of the MIL approach, its boosting version, and a baseline method without using MIL.

The proposed deconvolution formulation is tailored to the physics of SLIM imaging of biological samples, and a new fast algorithm is designed for computationally-efficient image reconstruction in this setting. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that deconvolution can reduce the width of the point-spread function by at least 20%, and can significantly improve the contrast of high-resolution features.

On-chip integrated lensless microscopy module for optical monitoring of adherent growing mammalian cells,"Lab-on-a-chip systems are increasingly applied in cell-based assays for toxicology and drug testing.

Meningioma subtype classification: A survey,"Meningioma subtype classification is a complex, real world and multi-class problem from the domain of histopathology. To solve this, various Computer Aided Techniques are employed in the past with a varying degree of success. This classification not only helps the technicians /doctors/pathologists to classify each sample correctly but also assists them in making the right decision for treatment. The main challenge in solving this problem is the inherent complexity due to high intra-class variability and low inter-class variation in the texture of tumor samples. Many attempts have been made and numerous algorithms are introduced till this day. Unfortunately, all of them have shown inconsistent performance. By inconsistent we mean that an algorithm is classifying only a subset of the subtypes correctly, on the rest it's not much accurate.

Communication was restored by extracellular addition of signaling molecules to non communicating bacteria.

Digital image analysis of cocci bacterial cells using active contour method,"The objective of the present study is to develop an automatic tool to identify and classify the different types of cocci bacterial cells in digital microscopic cell images using active contour method. Snakes, or active contours, are used extensively in computer vision and image processing applications, particularly to locate object boundaries. Geometric features are used to identify the arrangement of cocci bacterial cells, namely, cocci, diplococci, streptococci, tetrad, sarcinae and staphylococci using 3s, K-NN and Neural Network classifiers. The current methods rely on the subjective reading of profiles by a human expert based on the various manual staining methods. In this paper, we propose a method for cocci bacterial cell classification by segmenting digital bacterial cell images and extracting geometric features for cell classification. The experimental results are compared with the manual results obtained by the microbiology expert and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The experimentation is done using SEM digital images of various cocci bacterial communities.",Microorganisms;Image segmentation;Classification algorithms;Shape;Artificial neural networks;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Cell classification;segmentation;bacterial image analysis;cocci;diplococci;streptococci;tetrad;sarcinae;staphylococci;3s classifier;K-NN classifier;neural network classifier,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 International Conference on Signal and Image Processing,10.1109/ICSIP.2010.5697462
Histology Image Classification Using Supervised Classification and Multimodal Fusion,"The fast development of microscopy imaging techniques nowadays promotes the generation of a large amount of data. These data are very crucial not only for theoretical biomedical research but also for clinical usage. In order to decrease the inter-intra observer variability and save the human effort on labeling and classifying these images, a lot of research efforts have been devoted to the development of algorithms for biomedical images. Among such efforts, histology image classification is one of the most important areas due to its broad applications in pathological diagnosis such as cancer diagnosis. To improve classification accuracy, most of the previous work focuses on extracting more features and building algorithms for a specific task. This paper proposes a framework based on the novel and robust Collateral Representative Subspace Projection Modeling (C-RSPM) supervised classification model for general histology image classification. In the proposed framework, a cell image is first divided into 25 blocks to reduce the spatial complexity of computation, and one C-RSPM model is built on each block set which contains blocks in the same location from different images. For each testing image, our proposed framework first classifies each of its blocks using the C-RSPM classification model built for that block set, and then applies a multimodal late fusion algorithm with a weighted majority voting strategy to decide the final class label of the whole image. Experimenting using three-fold cross validation with three benchmark histology data sets shows that the proposed framework outperforms other well-known classifiers in the comparison and gives better results than the highest accuracy reported previously.",Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Testing;Cancer;Training data;Accuracy;Image segmentation;histology image classification;multimodal fusion;weighted majority voting algorithm;C-RSPM,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia,10.1109/ISM.2010.29
Automated leukemia detection using hausdorff dimension in blood microscopic images,"A cute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease characterized by the accumulation of lymphoblast in the bone marrow. An improved scheme for ALL detection in blood microscopic images is presented here. In this study features i.e. hausdorff dimension and contour signature are employed to classify a lymphocytic cell in the blood image into normal lymphocyte or lymphoblast (blasts). In addition shape and texture features are also extracted for better classification. Initial segmentation is done using K-means clustering which segregates leukocytes or white blood cells (WBC) from other blood components i.e. erythrocytes and platelets. The results of K-means are used for evaluating individual cell shape, texture and other features for final detection of leukemia. Fractal features i.e. hausdorff dimension is implemented for measuring perimeter roughness and hence classifying a lymphocytic cell nucleus.

Phase extraction and boundary removal in dual phase steel micrographs,"In order to study the material characteristics, it is essential to obtain the quantitative description of micro-structure of the materials. In this context, digital image processing is used to analyze the microscopic images of the materials. Extraction of grains/phases present in the material is the fundamental step to achieve the description of the micro-structure. In this work, we present an automated scheme for segmenting the phases present in the microscopic image of high strength low alloy steel. The challenge posed by the presence of revealed grain boundaries bearing striking similarity with one of the phases also has been addressed successfully. Experiment shows that proposed scheme has the inherent capability to cope up with the factors like magnification, imaging condition affecting the image characteristics.",Image segmentation;Steel;Grain boundaries;Pixel;Scanning electron microscopy;Phase segmentation;grain boundary removal;micro-structure analysis;material characterization,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON),10.1109/INDCON.2010.5712693

Segmentation and Classification of Histological Images - Application of Graph Analysis and Machine Learning Methods,"The characterization and quantitative description of histological images is not a simple problem. To reach a final diagnosis, usually the specialist relies on the analysis of characteristics easily observed, such as cells size, shape, staining and texture, but also depends on the hidden information of tissue localization, physiological and pathological mechanisms, clinical aspects, or other etiological agents. In this paper, Mathematical Morphology (MM) and Machine Learning (ML) methods were applied to characterize and classify histological images. MM techniques were employed for image analysis. The measurements obtained from image and graph analysis were fed into Machine Learning algorithms, which were designed and developed to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. Specifically, a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the used measures. The results show that the methodology was successful in characterizing and classifying the differences between the architectural organization of epithelial and adipose tissues.

Correlating optical biopsy with histopathology of wounds under topical intervention with honey,"Non-invasive visualization of wound bed with depth information is important to understand the tissue repair under therapeutic interventions. In this context, present study performs skin swept source-optical coherence tomography (i.e. optical biopsy/OCT) and correlates findings with histo-pathological observations on different types of traumatic non-healing wounds under honey dressing. Correlation between OCT and microscopic observations were explored especially in respect to progressive growth and maturation of the epithelial and sub-epithelial components. Characteristic transition of uniform hypo-lucid band for de-pigmented zone to wavy highly lucid band for the pigmented zone in the OCT images could be directly correlated with the microscopic findings on transformation of flattened pre-mature epithelium of de-pigmented area to thicker and matured epithelium with rete-pegs in pigmented zone.

Histo-pathological image analysis using OS-FCM and level sets,"Malignant melanomas are the most serious form of skin cancer accounting for the majority of skin cancer related deaths. Histo-pathological images of skin tissues are analyzed for detecting various types of melanomas. The automatic analysis of these images can greatly facilitate the diagnosis task for dermato-pathologists. The first and foremost step in automatic histo-pathological image analysis is to accurately segment the images into dermal and epidermal layers along with segmenting other tissues structures such as nests and melanocytic cells which indicate the presence of cancer. In this paper, we present a novel technique for segmenting the dermal-epidermal junction based on color features which are initially clustered using the Orientation Sensitive Fuzzy C-means algorithm (OS-FCM) and later refined with level set based algorithms. A few novel parameters which define the architecture of the dermis are then extracted.

Comparison of some features extraction method in wood identification,"Identification of a timber usually use the general characteristics, such as smell, impression felt, weight, color, and others.

Synthesis and studies of APTES functionalized magnetite nanoparticles,"In this work, we report the synthesis of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) functionalized magnetite nanoparticles. Structure of the APTES functionalized nanoparticles was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) while their size and morphology were determined by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Magnetic properties were measured using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. AC field induced heating ability of the nanoparticles was evaluated by the time-dependent calorimetric measurements using a RF generator. The functionalized nanoparticles were highly water soluble, monodispersed and superparamagnetic in nature with the blocking temperature at around 129 K. Cytotoxicity studies on MCF-7 cancer cells demonstrated that up to a dose of 10 mg/ ml, the APTES functionalized nanoparticles were nontoxic to the cells.

Segmentation of cell nuclei from histological images by ellipse fitting,"We propose a new algorithm for non-assisted segmentation of possibly clustered nuclei from histological images. We use elliptic shapes as parametric models to represent the nuclei contours and fit the parameters using the information present in the gray level intensity image and in the derived gradient image. Multiple seeds for each closed contour are found by ultimate erosion of an estimated edge image, resulting in an number of seeds generally larger than the number of nuclei. Our algorithm, called segmentation of nuclei by ellipse fitting (SNEF), constructs several candidate contours for each seed by fitting ellipses to selected subsets of edge pixels. In the end the algorithm selects the contours to be declared nuclei by comparing the values of a suitably chosen goodness of fit criterion. The proposed algorithm produces segmentations in agreement with an expert pathologist.",Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Shape;Object segmentation;Clustering algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Silicon,INPROCEEDINGS,2010,2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference,
An Optimal Transportation Approach for Nuclear Structure-Based Pathology,"Nuclear morphology and structure as visualized from histopathology microscopy images can yield important diagnostic clues in some benign and malignant tissue lesions. Precise quantitative information about nuclear structure and morphology, however, is currently not available for many diagnostic challenges. This is due, in part, to the lack of methods to quantify these differences from image data. We describe a method to characterize and contrast the distribution of nuclear structure in different tissue classes (normal, benign, cancer, etc.). The approach is based on quantifying chromatin morphology in different groups of cells using the optimal transportation (Kantorovich-Wasserstein) metric in combination with the Fisher discriminant analysis and multidimensional scaling techniques. We show that the optimal transportation metric is able to measure relevant biological information as it enables automatic determination of the class (e.g., normal versus cancer) of a set of nuclei. We show that the classification accuracies obtained using this metric are, on average, as good or better than those obtained utilizing a set of previously described numerical features. We apply our methods to two diagnostic challenges for surgical pathology: one in the liver and one in the thyroid. Results automatically computed using this technique show potentially biologically relevant differences in nuclear structure in liver and thyroid cancers.",Cancer;Image segmentation;Liver;Measurement;Transportation;Pixel;Lesions;Cancer detection;classification;nuclear structure;optimal transportation;pathology,ARTICLE,2011,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2010.2089693
Domain-Specific Image Analysis for Cervical Neoplasia Detection Based on Conditional Random Fields,"This paper presents a domain-specific automated image analysis framework for the detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. Our proposed framework departs from previous methods in that we include domain-specific diagnostic features in a probabilistic manner using conditional random fields. Likewise, we provide a novel window-based performance assessment scheme for 2D image analysis which addresses the intrinsic problem of image misalignment. Image regions corresponding to different tissue types are indentified for the extraction of domain-specific anatomical features. The unique optical properties of each tissue type and the diagnostic relationships between neighboring regions are incorporated in the proposed conditional random field model. The validity of our method is examined using clinical data from 48 patients, and its diagnostic potential is demonstrated by a performance comparison with expert colposcopy annotations, using histopathology as the ground truth. The proposed automated diagnostic approach can support or potentially replace conventional colposcopy, allow tissue specimen sampling to be performed in a more objective manner, and lower the number of cervical cancer cases in developing countries by providing a cost effective screening solution in low-resource settings.",Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Image analysis;Cervical cancer;Classification algorithms;Cervical cancer;classification;clustering;conditional random field;feature detection,ARTICLE,2011,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2011.2106796
Tracking Biological Cells in Time-Lapse Microscopy: An Adaptive Technique Combining Motion and Topological Features,"This paper presents a vision-based method for automatic tracking of biological cells in time-lapse microscopy by combining the motion features with the topological features of the cells. The automation of tracking frequently faces problems of segmentation error and of finding correct cell correspondence in consecutive frames, since the cells are of varying size and shape, and may have uneven movement; these problems become more acute when the cell population is very high. To reduce the segmentation error, we introduce a cell-detection method based on h-maxima transformation, followed by the fitting of an ellipse for the nucleus shape. To find the correct correspondence between the detected cells, the topological features, namely, color compatibility, area overlap and deformation are combined with the motion features of skewness and displacement. This reduces the ambiguity of matching and constructs accurately the trajectories of the cell proliferation. Finally, a template-matching-based backward tracking procedure is employed to recover any break in a cell trajectory that may occur due to the segmentation errors or the presence of a mitosis. The tracking procedure is tested using a number of different cell sequences with nonuniform illumination, or uneven cell motion, and is shown to provide high accuracy both in the detection and the tracking of the cells.",Tracking;Shape;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image color analysis;Lighting;Accuracy;Cell cluster;cell tracking;mitosis;phase-contrast image;time-lapse microscopy,ARTICLE,2011,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2011.2109001
3-D Reconstruction of Microtubules From Multi-Angle Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy Using Bayesian Framework,"Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy excites a thin evanescent field which theoretically decays exponentially. Each TIRF image is actually the projection of a 3-D volume and hence cannot alone produce an accurate localization of structures in the z-dimension, however, it provides greatly improved axial resolution for biological samples. Multiple angle-TIRF microscopy allows controlled variation of the incident angle of the illuminating laser beam, thus generating a set of images of different penetration depths with the potential to reconstruct the 3-D volume of the sample. With the ultimate goal to quantify important biological parameters of microtubules, we present a method to reconstruct 3-D position and orientation of microtubules based on multi-angle TIRF data, as well as experimental calibration of the actual decay function of the evanescent field at each angle. We validate our method using computer simulations, by creating a phantom simulating the curvilinear characteristics of microtubules and project the artificially constructed volume into a set of TIRF image for different penetration depth. The reconstructed depth information for the phantom data is shown to be accurate and robust to noise. We apply our method to microtubule TIRF images of PtK2 cells in vivo. By comparing microtubule curvatures of the reconstruction results and several electron microscopy (EM) images of vertically sliced sample of microtubules, we find that the curvature statistics of our reconstruction agree well with the ground truth (EM data). Quantifying the distribution of microtubule curvature reveals an interesting discovery that microtubules can buckle and form local bendings of considerably small radius of curvature which is also visually spotted on the EM images, while microtubule bendings on a larger scale generally have a much larger radius and cannot bear the stress of a large curvature. The presented method has the potential to provide a reliable tool for 3-D reconstruction and tracking of microtubules.",Microscopy;Image reconstruction;Laser beams;Substrates;Glass;Solid modeling;Optical microscopy;Curvature;microscope calibration;microtubules;penetration depth;reconstruction;TIRF,ARTICLE,2011,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2011.2114359
Contrast-Ultrasound Diffusion Imaging for Localization of Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in western men. An accurate early localization of prostate cancer, permitting efficient use of modern focal therapies, is currently hampered by a lack of imaging methods. Several methods have aimed at detecting microvascular changes associated with prostate cancer with limited success by quantitative imaging of blood perfusion. Differently, we propose contrast-ultrasound diffusion imaging, based on the hypothesis that the complexity of microvascular changes is better reflected by diffusion than by perfusion characteristics. Quantification of local, intravascular diffusion is performed after transrectal ultrasound imaging of an intravenously injected ultrasound contrast agent bolus. Indicator dilution curves are measured with the ultrasound scanner resolution and fitted by a modified local density random walk model, which, being a solution of the convective diffusion equation, enables the estimation of a local, diffusion-related parameter. Diffusion parametric images obtained from five datasets of four patients were compared with histology data on a pixel basis. The resulting receiver operating characteristic (curve area = 0.91) was superior to that of any perfusion-related parameter proposed in the literature. Contrast-ultrasound diffusion imaging seems therefore to be a promising method for prostate cancer localization, encouraging further research to assess the clinical reliability.",Imaging;Prostate cancer;Acoustics;Ultrasonic imaging;Quantization;Noise;Acoustic measurements;Biomedical imaging;blood vessels;cancer;parameter estimation;ultrasonography,ARTICLE,2011,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2011.2125981
Iterative Tensor Voting for Perceptual Grouping of Ill-Defined Curvilinear Structures,"In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for perceptual grouping and localization of ill-defined curvilinear structures. Our approach builds upon the tensor voting and the iterative voting frameworks. Its efficacy lies on iterative refinements of curvilinear structures by gradually shifting from an exploratory to an exploitative mode. Such a mode shifting is achieved by reducing the aperture of the tensor voting fields, which is shown to improve curve grouping and inference by enhancing the concentration of the votes over promising, salient structures. The proposed technique is validated on delineating adherens junctions that are imaged through fluorescence microscopy. However, the method is also applicable for screening other organisms based on characteristics of their cell wall structures. Adherens junctions maintain tissue structural integrity and cell–cell interactions. Visually, they exhibit fibrous patterns that may be diffused, heterogeneous in fluorescence intensity, or punctate and frequently perceptual. Besides the application to real data, the proposed method is compared to prior methods on synthetic and annotated real data, showing high precision rates.",Tensile stress;Kernel;Pixel;Junctions;Iterative methods;Surfaces;Image segmentation;Adherens junctions;curvilinear structures;iterative tensor voting (ITV);perceptual grouping,ARTICLE,2011,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2011.2129526
Solid-State Nanopore Recognition and Measurement Using Shannon Entropy,"Solid-state nanopores are structures that can be fabricated using the electron beam of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Nanopores can be used to electrically detect individual DNA molecules, and they have the potential to be applied to genomic sequencing. Current nanofabrication methods are manual and time-consuming, and thus, they do not allow for the fabrication of large-scale nanopore arrays. One of the requirements in the development of an efficient fabrication process is the automated recognition and measurement of nanopore dimension in real time. Here, we present a method for nanopore edge detection that uses Shannon entropy to identify nanopores in electron microscopy images. The nanostructure edges are determined by applying a Shannon entropy filter. This entropy image is segmented, and the texture-defined edges are determined. The diameters of nanopores as small as 3 nm are directly measured.",Entropy;Pixel;Image edge detection;Biomembranes;Fabrication;Histograms;Image segmentation;DNA sensing;microscopy;nanohole arrays;nanostructures,ARTICLE,2011,IEEE Photonics Journal,10.1109/JPHOT.2011.2129503

Partitioning Histopathological Images: An Integrated Framework for Supervised Color-Texture Segmentation and Cell Splitting,"For quantitative analysis of histopathological images, such as the lymphoma grading systems, quantification of features is usually carried out on single cells before categorizing them by classification algorithms. To this end, we propose an integrated framework consisting of a novel supervised cell-image segmentation algorithm and a new touching-cell splitting method. For the segmentation part, we segment the cell regions from the other areas by classifying the image pixels into either cell or extra-cellular category. Instead of using pixel color intensities, the color-texture extracted at the local neighborhood of each pixel is utilized as the input to our classification algorithm. The color-texture at each pixel is extracted by local Fourier transform (LFT) from a new color space, the most discriminant color space (MDC). The MDC color space is optimized to be a linear combination of the original RGB color space so that the extracted LFT texture features in the MDC color space can achieve most discrimination in terms of classification (segmentation) performance. To speed up the texture feature extraction process, we develop an efficient LFT extraction algorithm based on image shifting and image integral. For the splitting part, given a connected component of the segmentation map, we initially differentiate whether it is a touching-cell clump or a single nontouching cell. The differentiation is mainly based on the distance between the most likely radial-symmetry center and the geometrical center of the connected component. The boundaries of touching-cell clumps are smoothed out by Fourier shape descriptor before carrying out an iterative, concave-point and radial-symmetry based splitting algorithm. To test the validity, effectiveness and efficiency of the framework, it is applied to follicular lymphoma pathological images, which exhibit complex background and extracellular texture with nonuniform illumination condition. For comparison purposes, the results of the proposed segmentation algorithm are evaluated against the outputs of superpixel, graph-cut, mean-shift, and two state-of-the-art pathological image segmentation methods using ground-truth that was established by manual segmentation of cells in the original images. Our segmentation algorithm achieves better results than the other compared methods. The results of splitting are evaluated in terms of under-splitting, over-splitting, and encroachment errors. By summing up the three types of errors, we achieve a total error rate of 5.25% per image.",Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Pixel;Training;Algorithm design and analysis;Fourier transforms;Color-texture feature extraction;discriminant analysis;follicular lymphoma;histopathological image segmentation;local fourier transform;radial-symmetry point;supervised learning;touching-cell splitting,ARTICLE,2011,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2011.2141674
Bubble segmentation based on Shape From Shading for in-situ microscopy,"This paper describes a new bubble segmentation algorithm based on shape from shading for in-situ microscopy. An in-situ microscope is an instrument to capture and analyze intensity images of cells inside of a bioreactor with minimal operator intervention and without the risk of culture contamination.

A Fast Fuzzy-C means based marker controlled watershed segmentation of clustered nuclei,"Microscopy cell image analysis is a fundamental tool for biological research. This analysis is used in studies of different aspects of cell cultures. The main challenges in segmenting nuclei in histometry are due to the fact that the specimen is a 2-D section of a 3-D tissue sample. The 2-D sectioning can result in partially imaged nuclei, sectioning of nuclei at odd angles, and damage due to the sectioning process. The classic methodology for cell detection is image segmentation, which is a fundamental and difficult problem in computer vision. The difficulty in automatic segmentation of images of cells is often uneven due to auto fluorescence from the tissue and fluorescence from out-of-focus objects. This unevenness makes the separation of foreground and background a non-trivial task. The intensity variations within the nuclei further complicate the segmentation as the nuclei may be split into more than one object, leading to over-segmentation. Due to the cell nuclei are often clustered, make it difficult to separate the individual nuclei. Hence an automatic segmentation of cell nuclei is an essential step in image histometry and cytometry. This paper presents a very fast method to segment clustered nuclei cells by performing initial segmentation using FCM, then shape markers and marking function in a watershed-like algorithm are used to accurately separate clustered nuclei. The proposed approach gives a good tradeoff between the execution time, easy usability, and efficiency and segmentation quality. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Image segmentation;Shape;Transforms;Pixel;Active contours;Level set;Fluorescence;Active contours;Fuzzy - C means;H-minima;markers;marking function;watershed segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,"2011 International Conference on Computer, Communication and Electrical Technology (ICCCET)",10.1109/ICCCET.2011.5762465
The study on the interfacial transition zone of tire rubber powder mortar,"In this study, 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of waste rubber powder and 10% of sand was used to made crumb rubber cement mortar specimens in order to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the resulting cement. The examine the resulting materials the following tests were used: normal consistency water of fresh properties, compressive strength, and flexural strength, splitting strength, shrinkage test and durability. The materials were cured for ages of 1, 3, 7, 28, 56 and 91 days. Optical microscope, X-Ray Diffract meter, and scanning electron microscopy observations of the rubber powder and cement paste were made to evaluate the interface characteristics, to verify the engineering properties of rubber concrete and to evaluate the development of the strength and durability of the materials. The aim of the study was to provide a basis for the use of waste rubber tires and to provide a reference for the future. The results showed that the setting time of crumb rubber cement mortar increases as the amount of replacement waste rubber powder increased. The higher the substitution in the mixture, the more water was necessary to achieve consistency. Compressive strength, flexural strength and splitting strength decreased, as the substitution of rubber powder increased; at the same time, the higher the amount of replacement, the lower the strength was. This result may be due to the lower viscosity of the rubber particles as compared to the cement particles. OM, X-ray, SEM observations confirmed these results and showed that the cement paste and rubber particles bond less. Thus, with more replacement material in the concrete, the material interfacial transition zone between the interfaces will become more vulnerable.",Rubber;Powders;Mortar;Concrete;Scanning electron microscopy;Optical microscopy;Crumb rubber cement mortar;Interfacial transition zone;Microstructure;Compressive,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,"2011 International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks (CECNet)",10.1109/CECNET.2011.5769154
Segmentation of nodular medulloblastoma using Random Walker and Hierarchical Normalized Cuts,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common brain tumor in children. Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between specific signaling pathway abnormalities, a tendency to more favorable outcomes, and a histopathological feature: nodular growth patterns. In this work we present a new segmentation scheme which requires minimal user interaction to segment nodules on MB histopathological sections. Our segmentation scheme consists of two steps: (1) color reduction using Hierarchical Normalized Cuts (HNCut), (2) Random Walker (RW) segmentation within the reduced HNCut color space. Across a cohort of 18 nodular MB images, our integrated HNCut and RW scheme yielded nodule segmentations with a Dice coefficient of 83:55 ± 12:4% and Predictive Positive Value (PPV) of 93:71 ± 9:0%.",Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Pixel;Cancer;Tumors;Image edge detection;Shape,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE 37th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC),10.1109/NEBC.2011.5778640
A texture-based classifier to discriminate anaplastic from non-anaplastic medulloblastoma,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common brain tumor in children. There are four distinct subtypes of MB, but patients with anaplastic/large cell have the worst prognosis. Since the morbidity is highly correlated with treatment for MB, the ability to distinguish aggressive (such as anaplastic/large cell) MB is crucial. We present a scheme that leverages quantitative image texture features (Haar, Haralick, and Laws) and classifier ensembles (random forests) to automatically classify histological images from MB resection as being anaplastic/large cell or non-anaplastic/large cell.

Multifractal Feature Based Cancer Detection for Pathological Images,This paper presents a significant multifractal feature description based texture discriminating technique to examine the cancer and non-cancer regions in pathological images. We acquired the characteristics (local singularity and global regularity information) of the texture using multifractal computation and used them to discriminate the highly complex visual patterns shown in the pathological images. The proposed feature description method was applied to two different samples of pathological cancer liver images in different magnifications (given by digital slider) with different patch sizes (patch is a local window that we used to capture the data for training and testing). The outcomes of the experiments indicate that the proposed multifractal feature description based texture classification method is remarkable.,Fractals;Cancer;Pathology;Pixel;Liver;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/icbbe.2011.5780208

A pixel classification system for segmenting biomedical images using intensity neighborhoods and dimension reduction,"We present an intensity neighborhood-based system for segmenting arbitrary biomedical image datasets using supervised learning. Because neighborhood methods are often associated with high-dimensional feature vectors, we explore a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based method to reduce the dimensionality (and provide computational savings) of each neighborhood. Our results show that the system can accurately segment data in three applications: tissue segmentation from brain MR data, and histopathological images, and nuclei segmentation from fluorescence images. Our results also show that the dimension reduction method we described improves computational efficiency while maintaining similar accuracy.",Pixel;Image segmentation;Training;Principal component analysis;Biomedical imaging;Testing;Support vector machines;pixel classification;image segmentation;intensity neighborhood;dimension reduction,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872720
Boosted Spectral Embedding (BoSE): Applications to content-based image retrieval of histopathology,"In machine learning, non-linear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) is commonly used to embed high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space while preserving local object adjacencies. However, the majority of NLDR methods define object adjacencies using distance metrics that do not account for the quality of the features in the high-dimensional space. In this paper we present Boosted Spectral Embedding (BoSE), a variant of the traditional Spectral Embedding (SE) that utilizes a Boosted Distance Metric (BDM) to improve the low-dimensional representation of the data. Under the naive assumption that all features are equally important, SE uses the Euclidean distance metric to define object-distance relationships. However, the BDM selectively weights features via the AdaBoost algorithm such that the low-dimensional representation contains only the most discriminating features. In this work BoSE is evaluated against SE in the context of digitized histopathology images using (a) content-based image retrieval and (b) classification via Random Forest of the low-dimensional representation. Using images from a cohort of 58 prostate cancer patient studies, BoSE and SE separated benign and malignant samples with areas under the precision-recall curve (AUPRCs) of 0.95 and 0.67 and classification accuracies using a Random Forest (RF) classifer were 0.93 and 0.79, respectively. For a cohort of 55 breast cancer studies, BoSE and SE performed comparably in terms of both RF accuracy and AUPRC. In addition, a qualitative visualization of the low-dimensional data representations suggests that BoSE exhibits improved class separability over SE.",Measurement;Accuracy;Radio frequency;Prostate cancer;Breast cancer;Feature extraction;content-based image retrieval;spectral embedding;boosting;histopathology;BoSE;prostate cancer;breast cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872779
Multi-modal data fusion schemes for integrated classification of imaging and non-imaging biomedical data,"With a wide array of multi-modal, multi-protocol, and multi-scale biomedical data available for disease diagnosis and prognosis, there is a need for quantitative tools to combine such varied channels of information, especially imaging and non-imaging data (e.g. spectroscopy, proteomics). The major problem in such quantitative data integration lies in reconciling the large spread in the range of dimensionalities and scales across the different modalities. The primary goal of quantitative data integration is to build combined meta-classifiers; however these efforts are thwarted by challenges in (1) homogeneous representation of the data channels, (2) fusing the attributes to construct an integrated feature vector, and (3) the choice of learning strategy for training the integrated classifier. In this paper, we seek to (a) define the characteristics that guide the 4 independent methods for quantitative data fusion that use the idea of a meta-space for building integrated multi-modal, multi-scale meta-classifiers, and (b) attempt to understand the key components which allowed each method to succeed. These methods include (1) Generalized Embedding Concatenation (GEC), (2) Consensus Embedding (CE), (3) Semi-Supervised Multi-Kernel Graph Embedding (SeSMiK), and (4) Boosted Embedding Combination (BEC). In order to evaluate the optimal scheme for fusing imaging and non-imaging data, we compared these 4 schemes for the problems of combining (a) multi-parametric MRI with spectroscopy for prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis in vivo, and (b) histological image with proteomic signatures (obtained via mass spectrometry) for predicting prognosis in CaP patients. The kernel combination approach (SeSMiK) marginally outperformed the embedding combination schemes. Additionally, intelligent weighting of the data channels (based on their relative importance) appeared to outperform unweighted strategies. All 4 strategies easily outperformed a naïve decision fusion approach, suggesting that data integration methods will play an important role in the rapidly emerging field of integrated diagnostics and personalized healthcare.",Kernel;Magnetic resonance imaging;Prostate cancer;Proteomics;Feature extraction;Spectroscopy;data fusion;prostate cancer;GFF;SeSMiK;Consensus Embedding;Kernel combination,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872379

To tackle this, a two step pruning process based on the Fast Marching Method is first applied to obtain an over-segmented image. This is followed by a merging step based on an effective feature representation. The algorithm is applied on two different datasets: one from the ascidian Ciona and the other from the plant Arabidopsis.

Splitting touching-cell clusters on histopathological images,"In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for splitting touching/overlappingcells in histopathological images. Given a binary segmentation map by which the cell nuclei have been delineated and separated from the other regions, for each connected component, we differentiate whether it is a touching-cell clump or a single non-touching cell after we smooth out its boundary by Fourier shape descriptor. The differentiation is mainly based on the distance between the most likely radial-symmetry center and the geometrical center of the connected component. Finally a new iterative splitting algorithm is only applied to the touching-cell clumps based on detected concave point and radial-symmetric center. We tested our splitting framework on 21 challenging Follicle Lymphoma images and get an average error rate of 5.2%.",Biomedical imaging;Immune system;Image segmentation;Touching-cell splitting;radial-symmetric point;concave point;histopathology image,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872389

A new segmentation framework for infrared spectroscopic imaging using frequent pattern mining,"Histologic analysis of a stained tissue sample by a trained pathologist forms the definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer. Rapid and objective second opinions are highly desirable to make more accurate diagnostic decisions. One alternate method is to use Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging, which is an emerging technique that combines the molecular selectivity of spectroscopy with the spatial specificity of optical microscopy. While instrumentation is well-developed for FT-IR imaging, information extraction from the data could benefit greatly from improved approaches. Here we propose a new approach to segment histologic classes in a tissue for FT-IR imaging using frequent pattern mining. Prior to applying frequent pattern mining, FT-IR images are discretized, and subsequent pruning method and feature selection method result in a classifier for the segmentation. The method is evaluated using two different datasets. Results indicate that accurate histologic segmentation is achievable by this approach.",Imaging;Pixel;Image segmentation;Biological tissues;Cancer;Data mining;Support vector machines;Infrared spectroscopic imaging;histological segmentation;discretization;frequent pattern mining;feature selection,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872443
Active Contour for Overlap Resolution using Watershed BASED initialization (ACOReW): Applications to histopathology,"In recent years, shape based active contours have emerged as a natural solution to overlap resolution. However, most of these shape-based methods are limited to finding and resolving one object overlap per scene and require user intervention for model initialization. In this paper, we present a novel synergistic segmentation scheme called Active Contour for Overlap Resolution using Watershed (ACOReW). ACOReW combines shape priors with boundary and region-based active contours in a level set formulation with a watershed scheme for model initialization for identifying and resolving multiple object overlaps in an image scene. The energy functional for the variational active contour model is composed of three complimentary terms (a) a shape model which constrains the active contour to a pre-defined shape, (b) boundary based term which directs the active contour model to the image gradient, and (c) a third term driving the shape prior and the active contour towards a homogeneous intensity region. In this paper we show an application of ACOReW in the context of segmenting nuclear and glandular structures on prostate and breast cancer histopathology. The results of qualitative and quantitative evaluation on 100 prostate and 14 breast cancer histology images reveals that ACOReW outperforms two state of the art segmentation schemes (Geodesic Active Contour (GAC) and Rousson's shape based model) and resolves up to 92% of overlapping/occluded lymphocytes and nuclei on prostate and breast cancer histology images.",Shape;Active contours;Level set;Breast cancer;Image segmentation;Mathematical model;Context,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872482
Statistical color texture descriptors for histological images analysis,"In this paper we compare different approaches to combine color and statistical texture descriptors.

We focus on the particular case of histological datasets where color plays an important role due to the staining process of the biological samples. We also introduce two new variants of the well-known Local Binary Patterns (LBP) operator. We test these approaches on three diversified histological datasets. We show that combining color and texture features extracted separately is preferable on datasets having a large variability in the staining, while simultaneous extraction of color and texture information is recommended only for more standardized stainings.",Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Histograms;Pixel;Image analysis;Indexes;Biopsy;Color texture;LBP;Co-occurrence matrix;stained tissue;classification;histology,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872508
Comparison of sparse coding and kernel methods for histopathological classification of gliobastoma multiforme,"This paper compares the performance of redundant representation and sparse coding against classical kernel methods for classifying histological sections. Sparse coding has been proven an effective technique for restoration, and has recently been extended to classification. The main issue with histology sections classification is inherent heterogeneity, which is a result of technical and biological variations. Technical variations originate from sample preparation, fixation, and staining from multiple laboratories, whereas biological variations originate from tissue content. Image patches are represented with invariant features at local and global scales, where local refers to responses measured with Laplacian of Gaussians, and global refers to measurements in the color space. Experiments are designed to learn dictionaries through sparse coding, and to train classifiers through kernel methods using normal, necrotic, apoptotic, and tumor regions with characteristics of high cellularity. Two different kernel methods, that of a support vector machine (SVM) and a kernel discriminant analysis (KDA), were used for comparative analysis. Preliminary investigation on the histological samples of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) indicates the kernel methods perform as good, if not better, than sparse coding with redundant representation.",Kernel;Dictionaries;Encoding;Support vector machines;Cancer;Tumors;Training;Histology sections;sparse coding;dictionary learning;kernel methods,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872505
Solidification processes in the Sn-rich part of the SnCu system,"In this study SnCu solder spheres (Ø 270 μm, CR ~ 1 K/s) were investigated in order to verify the solidified microstructure according to the Sn-rich part of the SnCu phase diagram. The investigated alloys are Sn99.9, SnCu0.25, SnCu0.5, SnCu0.7, SnCu0.9, SnCu1.2, SnCu1.5, and SnCu3.0. In order to understand the solidification process, such aspects as morphology, grain structure and undercooling were analysed. The microstructure was investigated by optical microscopy, SEM and EDX. The undercooling was measured by DSC. It will be shown that small SnCu solder spheres solidify not only with commonly known β-Sn dendrites and fine Cu6Sn5 IMCs in the interdendritic spacing, but with specific and systematic changes in morphology, which depend on composition. The successive morphology transitions were found: from 1) fine Cu6Sn5 IMCs in β-Sn to 2) small β-Sn cells to 3) β-Sn cellular/dendritic to 4) fine Cu6Sn5 IMCs in β-Sn or undirected β-Sn cells. The area fraction of these different morphologies and the number of grain orientations were estimated from the cross-sections of about 20 solder spheres per composition. This allows a quantitative description of the microstructure and its compositional dependency. The results also show that the formation of large Cu6Sn5 IMCs provokes more grain orientations compared to SnCu solders solidified without large intermetallic phases.",Microstructure;Morphology;Copper;Scanning electron microscopy;Optical microscopy;Temperature measurement,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC),10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898497

An incremental method for mosaicing of optical microscope imagery,"Digital imaging is nowadays widely employed in the field of optical microscopy. One of the most apparent benefits consists in the possibility for the researcher to see the whole biological sample in one image, achieved by collecting all the parts being inspected. Common approaches work in batch mode and rely on known motorized x-y stage offsets of the microscope holder. Or alternatively, the methods are conceived just to provide visually pleasant mosaics off-line, that are often built by altering the photometric values or the geometric properties of the original component images. This work presents an incremental mosaicing method for optical microscopy imagery, compliant with on-line requirements and suitable even for non-motorized microscopes. The resulting mosaics are very accurate and preserve the consistency of the original images so to be used for further global measurement steps. Nevertheless, the mosaics are visually pleasant so to be used for visual inspection as well.

Microscopic shape from focus with optimal illumination,"We present a novel method for compensating illumination artifacts in shape from focus reconstruction that does not require additional measurement time. Frequently applied in optical microscopy, shape from focus requires rich surface texture over the whole scene. This prerequisite is violated in saturated image regions. To overcome this limitation, we automatically compensate for the scene reflectance by means of a projector-camera system on a per-image basis. We iteratively adapt illumination in the first image and consecutively track the compensation pattern through the image stack to reduce measurement time. Despite the low measurement time, our experiments show that our method outperforms the standard shape from focus approach and is also superior to competing methods like high dynamic range imaging in terms of measurement time and accuracy.",Cameras;Lighting;Microscopy;Time measurement;Shape;Optical microscopy;Image reconstruction,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,CVPR 2011 WORKSHOPS,10.1109/CVPRW.2011.5981677
neuroCornea — Diabetic peripheral neuropathy early diagnosis and follow-up through in vivo automatic analysis of corneal nerves morphology,"Peripheral diabetic neuropathy is the major cause of chronic disability in diabetic patients. The early diagnosis and accurate assessment of peripheral neuropathy are important to define the higher risk patients, decrease patient morbidity and assess the performance of new therapies. However, the peripheral neuropathy diagnosis often fails or occurs only when patients became symptomatic due to the non-availability of a simple non invasive method for early diagnosis. Corneal confocal microscopy is a non-invasive imaging modality that can document corneal nerves morphology. In this project, we will develop a technique for early diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy based on automatic analysis of corneal nerves images. This project comprises the development of automatic algorithms for nerve segmentation and morphometric parameters extraction, the evaluation of the best parameters for early diagnosis and follow-up of diabetic neuropathy and the development of a corneal confocal imaging module to be used as an add-on to a standard slit-lamp.",Diabetes;Microscopy;Cornea;In vivo;Image segmentation;Educational institutions;Diabetic neuropathy;Corneal nerves;Corneal confocal microscopy;Automatic image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,1st Portuguese Biomedical Engineering Meeting,10.1109/ENBENG.2011.6026071
Acceleration of Two Point Correlation Function Calculation for Pathology Image Segmentation,"The segmentation of tissue regions in high-resolution microscopy is a challenging problem due to both the size and appearance of digitized pathology sections. The two point correlation function (TPCF) has proved to be an effective feature to address the textural appearance of tissues. However the calculation of the TPCF functions is computationally burdensome and often intractable in the gigapixel images produced by slide scanning devices for pathology application. In this paper we present several approaches for accelerating deterministic calculation of point correlation functions using theory to reduce computation, parallelization on distributed systems, and parallelization on graphics processors. Previously we show that the correlation updating method of calculation offers an 8-35x speedup over frequency domain methods and decouples efficient computation from the select scales of Fourier methods. In this paper, using distributed computation on 64 compute nodes provides a further 42x speedup. Finally, parallelization on graphics processors (GPU) results in an additional 11-16x speedup using an implementation capable of running on a single desktop machine.",Correlation;Graphics processing unit;Parallel processing;Instruction sets;Image segmentation;Interpolation;Microscopy;Image Segmentation;Digital Pathology;Two Point Correlation Function;Graphical Processing Unit,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,"2011 IEEE First International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, Imaging and Systems Biology",10.1109/HISB.2011.10
Cervical Cancer Classification Using Gabor Filters,"This paper presents a novel algorithm for computer-assisted classification of cervical cancers using digitized histology images of biopsies. Texture analysis of the nuclei structure is very important for classification of cervical cancer histology. In this paper we present a two-tier classification strategy using Gabor filter banks for local classification and abnormality spread for global taxonomy. The test data used in this work are digitized histology images of cervical biopsies acquired from the pathology laboratories in the Saiful An war Hospital in Indonesia. The images from over 500 subjects are categorized by the pathologists into five grades, benign, pre-cancer (CIN1, CIN2, CIN3) and malignant. In the algorithm developed in this work, a texture classification method using Gabor filter banks is implemented to segment the image into five possible regions: of background, normal, abnormal, basal and stroma cells. The global classification algorithm uses the segmented image for the final prognosis of the degree of malignancies from benign to malignant. The process of texture segmentation using the Gabor filter bank involves the application of filters for several spatial frequencies and orientations. The Gabor filter bank is applied to cervical histology images with six frequencies and four orientations. Feature vectors are formed, comprising the response of each pixel and its neighboring pixels to each filter. The feature vectors are then used to classify each pixel and its immediate neighbor pixels into five categories. Based on the spread of abnormalities on the epithelium layer, the cervical histology image is then classified. The classification results are then used to further classify the image into: 1) normal, 2) pre-cancer and 3) malignant. The pre-cancer is divided into: a) CIN 1, b) CIN 2 and c) CIN 3. The final system will take as input a biopsy image of the cervix containing the epithelium layer and provide the classification using our new approach, to assist the pathologist in cervical cancer diagnosis.",Gabor filters;Image segmentation;Cervical cancer;Biomedical imaging;Image color analysis;Filter banks;cervical cancer;histology image;biopsy;texture;Gabor filter,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,"2011 IEEE First International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, Imaging and Systems Biology",10.1109/HISB.2011.15
Sampling step importance in hierarchical semantic segmentation of microscopic images,"The objective of semantic segmentation in microscopic images is to extract the cellular, nuclear or tissue components. This problem is challenging due to the large variations of these components features (size, shape, orientation or texture). In this paper we improve the technique presented in [17] used to identify the epithelial nuclei (crypt) against interstitial nuclei in microscopic images taken from colon tissues. In the proposed enhanced approach, the crypt inner boundary is detected using the closing morphological pyramid instead of morphological hierarchy. The outer crypt border is determined by the epithelial nuclei, overlapped by the maximal isoline of the inner boundary. The use of sampling in building the pyramid offers computational efficiency, reduces the amount of used memory, increase the robustness and preserve the quality results.

Detection of prostate cancer on histopathology using color fractals and Probabilistic Pairwise Markov models,"In this paper we present a system for detecting regions of carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) in H&E stained radical prostatectomy specimens using the color fractal dimension. Color textural information is known to be a valuable characteristic to distinguish CaP from benign tissue. In addition to color information, we know that cancer tends to form contiguous regions. Our system leverages the color staining information of histology as well as spatial dependencies. The color and textural information is first captured using color fractal dimension. To incorporate spatial dependencies, we combine the probability map constructed via color fractal dimension with a novel Markov prior called the Probabilistic Pairwise Markov Model (PPMM). To demonstrate the capability of this CaP detection system, we applied the algorithm to 27 radical prostatectomy specimens from 10 patients. A per pixel evaluation was conducted with ground truth provided by an expert pathologist using only the color fractal feature first, yielding an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) curve of 0.790. In conjunction with a Markov prior, the resultant color fractal dimension + Markov random field (MRF) classifier yielded an AUC of 0.831.",Computational fluid dynamics;Fractals;Cancer;Image color analysis;Markov processes;Color;Bayesian methods,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090927
An algorithm for cancer nest feature extraction from pathological images,"Here, we propose an algorithm to automatically obtain extraction filters for the affected regions from cancer images. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps: extraction of affected region candidates and elimination of false positives. Useful features of cancer images, such as the area and degree of circularity of cancer nests, etc., are extracted using the derived filters. These features are useful for supporting pathological diagnosis. Automatic Construction of Tree-structural Image Transformation (ACTIT) was used to construct these filters to extract the affected regions from the image. The proposed algorithm was applied to a mouth cancer pathological image. The results confirmed that the proposed algorithm can obtain good filters capable of extracting cancer nests. The derived filters were also applied to other images from the same specimen. The results also indicated that the generated filters show general versatility in extracting cancer nest candidates. The area and degree of circularity of the cancer nets were also derived automatically.",Feature extraction;Cancer;Pathology;Vegetation;Topology;Educational institutions;Mouth,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090926
An integrated texton and bag of words classifier for identifying anaplastic medulloblastomas,"In this paper we present a combined Bag of Words and texton based classifier for differentiating anaplastic and non-anaplastic medulloblastoma on digitized histopathology. The hypothesis behind this work is that histological image signatures may reflect different levels of aggressiveness of the disease and that texture based approaches can help discriminate between more aggressive and less aggressive phenotypes of medulloblastoma. The bag of words approach attempts to model the occurrence of differently expressed image features. In this work we choose to model the image features via textons which can quantitatively capture and model texture appearance in the images. The texton-based features, obtained via two methods, the Haar Wavelet responses and MR8 filter bank, provide spatial orientation and rotation invariant attributes. Applying these features to the bag of words framework yields textural representations that can be used in conjunction with a classifier (κ-nearest neighbor) or a content based image retrieval system. Over multiple runs of randomized cross validation, a κ-NN classifier in conjunction with Haar wavelets and the texton, bag of words approach yielded a mean classification accuracy of 80, an area under the precision recall curve of 87 and an area under the ROC curve of 83 in distinguishing between anaplastic and non-anaplastic medulloblastomas on a cohort of 36 patient studies.",Accuracy;Dictionaries;Biomedical imaging;Training;Cancer;Diseases;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090931
In-vitro cell quantification method based on depth dependent analysis of brain tissue microscopic images,In this study we developed a new automatic quantification method to count the number of targeted fluorescently labeled molecules of in-vitro rat brain tissue images. NG2+ glial cells were monitored in order to detect their proliferation to their same kind of cells or to another astrocyte cells using different fluorescently labeled molecules. The method is based on morphological segmentation followed by depth-dependent detection operation applied to a stack of confocal microscopic images.

To achieve this, images of the various fields on the slide can be captured and stitched automatically to form a virtual slide map.

In aggregate, our validation dataset includes 220 nuclei from 11 distinct tissue regions selected at random by an experienced neuropathologist.

Motor neuron morphology estimation for its classification in the Drosophila brain,"Type-specific dendritic arborization patterns dictate synaptic connectivity and are fundamental determinants of neuronal function. We exploit the morphological stereotypy and relative simplicity of the Drosophila nervous system to model the diverse dendritic morphologies of individual motor neurons (MNs) to understand underlying principles of synaptic connectivity in a motor circuit. The genetic tractability of Drosophila allows us to label single MNs with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and serially reconstruct identifiable MNs in 3D with confocal microscopy. Our computational approach aims at the robust segmentation of the MN volumes and the simultaneous partitioning into their compartments, namely the soma, axon and dendrites. We use the idea of co-segmentation, where every image along the z-axis (depth) is clustered using information from `neighboring' depths. As appearance we use a 3D extension of Haar features and for the shape we define an implicit representation of the segmentation domain.",Shape;Image segmentation;Three dimensional displays;Manganese;Nerve fibers;Morphology,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091911
A Computational Method for Tracking and Analysing Dynamic Phenotypes of Individual Macromolecules,"Fluorescence time-lapse microscopic imaging is a powerful tool for investigating dynamic cellular processes. To date, automated fluorescence microscopes are increasingly used to generate high-content spatial-temporal image data at high-throughput. Such large-scale data require much computational effort to quantify complex macromolecular dynamics such as temporal changes in fluorescence intensity, spatial locations, trajectory and velocity. Here, we propose a semi-automated method for tracking dynamics of individual macromolecules and performed quantitative analysis of the extracted phenotypes. We compared our proposed method with the manual identification of macromolecules and with a particle tracking method provided by the image analysis software, ImageJ. Our results clearly provide more object trajectories than the ImageJ method and our phenotypic analysis illustrates the relationship between two significant features with human-interpretable visualization.",Feature extraction;Band pass filters;Trajectory;Joining processes;Data models;Data visualization;Microscopy;Phenotypic profiling;time-lapse fluorescence microscopy;Particle tracking;data modeling,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering,10.1109/BIBE.2011.22

We developed an optical microscopic spectroscopy technique, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy, that is capable of quantifying statistical properties of cell structure at the nanoscale. Our animal and human studies demonstrated that alterations in the nanoscale cell architecture is one of the earliest events in carcinogenesis and precedes any other known morphological changes at large length scales (i.e. microarchitecture). This appears to be a general event in carcinogenesis, which is supported by our data in five types of cancer: colon, pancreatic, lung, esophageal and ovarian cancers.",Computer architecture;Optical microscopy;Microscopy;Cancer;Microprocessors;Nanoscale devices;Optical diffraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,IEEE Photonic Society 24th Annual Meeting,10.1109/PHO.2011.6110800

Blood microscopic image segmentation using rough sets,"Hematological disorders are mostly identified based on characterization of blood parameters i.e. erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets. Microscopic examination of leukocytes in blood slides is the most frequent laboratory investigation performed for malignancy detection. Hematological examination of blood is an indispensable technique still today and solely depends on human visual interpretation. Such examination are subjected to inter and intra-observer variations, slowness, tiredness and operator experience. Accurate and authentic diagnosis of hematological neoplasia can help in the planning of suitable surgery and chemotherapy, and generally improve the quality of patient care. Microscopy cell image analysis is a tool which facilitates conventional blood examination for disease detection using quantitative microscopy. Thus microscopic image analysis serves as an impressive diagnostic tool for hematological disease (leukemia, malaria, psoriasis, AIDS etc) recognition. The present paper aims at leukocyte or white blood cell (WBC) segmentation which can assist in acute leukemia detection. A rough set based clustering approach is followed for color based segmentation of WBC.

Computational features such as shape, intensity, and texture were extracted from glandular areas. Segmented glandular areas of LCIS were significantly larger, thicker, lower and less variant in intensity, compared to normal areas (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.01).

Cancer detection from biopsy images using probabilistic and discriminative features,"In the cancer detection from stained biopsy images, it is important to extract histologically discriminative characteristics. For this purpose, we propose a novel method to extract statistical and morphological features. At the first stage, we estimate cell component memberships at each pixel by applying an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to the color information. Next we calculate the local co-occurrence of the memberships as image features. And then, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied to those features for final decision of whether cancer or not, with enhancing the discrimination. In the experiments on real biopsy images of cancers, the resulting detection accuracy is superior to the other methods.",Feature extraction;Biopsy;Cancer;Cancer detection;Image color analysis;Accuracy;Vectors;cancer detection;biopsy image;cell component membership;local co-occurrence;linear discriminant analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115758
Automated nuclei clump decomposition for image analysis in neuronal cell fluorescent microscopy,"Automated clump decomposition is crucial for the analysis of neuronal cell fluorescent microscopic images due to inevitable nuclei and cell clumping.

The use of shape models enhances its robustness in handling complicated clumps against those bottom-up approaches without prior knowledge. We adopt a strategy of model verification in allowable local shape changes to improve the computational efficiency over template matching.

Segmentation of cellular structures in actin tagged fluorescence confocal microscopy images,The paper reports on a novel method for reconstruction of cellular features including cell nuclei and cellular boundaries from actin tagged fluorescence confocal microscopy images.

Histological Image Feature Mining Reveals Emergent Diagnostic Properties for Renal Cancer,"Computer-aided histological image classification systems are important for making objective and timely cancer diagnostic decisions. These systems use combinations of image features that quantify a variety of image properties. Because researchers tend to validate their diagnostic systems on specific cancer endpoints, it is difficult to predict which image features will perform well given a new cancer endpoint. In this paper, we define a comprehensive set of common image features (consisting of 12 distinct feature subsets) that quantify a variety of image properties. We use a data-mining approach to determine which feature subsets and image properties emerge as part of an ""optimal"" diagnostic model when applied to specific cancer endpoints. Our goal is to assess the performance of such comprehensive image feature sets for application to a wide variety of diagnostic problems. We perform this study on 12 endpoints including 6 renal tumor subtype endpoints and 6 renal cancer grade endpoints.",Feature extraction;Cancer;Shape;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Tiles;Topology;histology;image mining;computer-aided diagnosis,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine,10.1109/BIBM.2011.112

Segmentation fusion for connectomics,"We address the problem of automatic 3D segmentation of a stack of electron microscopy sections of brain tissue. Unlike previous efforts, where the reconstruction is usually done on a section-to-section basis, or by the agglomerative clustering of 2D segments, we leverage information from the entire volume to obtain a globally optimal 3D segmentation. To do this, we formulate the segmentation as the solution to a fusion problem. We first enumerate multiple possible 2D segmentations for each section in the stack, and a set of 3D links that may connect segments across consecutive sections. We then identify the fusion of segments and links that provide the most globally consistent segmentation of the stack. We show that this two-step approach of pre-enumeration and posterior fusion yields significant advantages and provides state-of-the-art reconstruction results. Finally, as part of this method, we also introduce a robust rotationally-invariant set of features that we use to learn and enumerate the above 2D segmentations. Our features outperform previous connectomic-specific descriptors without relying on a large set of heuristics or manually designed filter banks.",Three dimensional displays;Neurons;Image segmentation;Brain;Labeling;Joining processes;Educational institutions,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 International Conference on Computer Vision,10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126240
Cell Nuclei Detection in Histopathological Images by Using Multi-curvature Edge Cue,"The automated detection of cell nuclei, which is an important step in the pipeline of quantitative histopathological analysis, has received considerable attentions in recent years. However, biological variations, uneven staining and illumination, non-rigid deformations and touching or overlapping of the cell nuclei have made the detection procedure a major hurdle. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting and localizing cell nuclei based only on the cue of contour. The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates a pixel classifier using an over-complete set of contour features with different curvatures and orientations. We present results that are very competitive with other state-of-art cell nuclei detection scheme and show robustness to biological variations, different staining and illumination conditions, touching or partial occlusions. Our major contributions are the multicurvature cell nucleus contour model, and an efficient and effective strategy for sharing parameters between contour feature extractors of the same curvature but different orientations.",Image edge detection;Feature extraction;Kernel;Training;Detectors;Biological system modeling;Humans;edge detection;cell nuclei detection;object recognition;computer vision;machine learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 Seventh International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security,10.1109/CIS.2011.243
Label free assessment of live cell quality with total internal reflection microscopy,"Summary form only given. Cellular feedstocks underpin many Regenerative Medicine (RM) therapies. Suitable strategies for the large-scale manufacture are therefore required to ensure high quality RM products are produced consistently at an economically acceptable price. Allied to this is the need for measurement tools capable of characterising cell quality and its dependence on key manufacture parameters in-process. Currently, cell populations are routinely monitored to assess quality using conventional biological analysis (e.g. cell surface markers, gene expression). This approach is destructive, not suitable for in-process measurements and renders time course experiments impossible. Alternatively non-destructive approaches that assess cell morphology can also used, with light microscopy techniques (e.g. bright field, phase contrast imaging) being the primary methods. Often these microscopy techniques are combined with pre-treatment of cells with exogenous labels such as fluorescent markers. This can provide functional information but has the disadvantage that such cell modifications are invasive and potentially toxic to the cells. Label free approaches are also used and whilst this enables non-invasive monitoring of live cells in culture, such microscopy techniques are currently non-quantitative with characterisation fully dependent on the skills and experience of the operator. Image contrast and resolution are also often lacking making morphological assessments unreliable. Additionally, more complex parameters such as dynamic cell behaviour and cell-substrate interactions are needed to provide the necessary mechanistic insight to characterise cellular processes and as parameters for effective process design and quality control tools. This presentation will address the above issues through the development of a total internal reflection microscope (TIRM) to enable the quantitative study of cellular processes and live cell quality at high resolution and without the use of labels. TIRM is a non-fluorescent imaging technique which is based on the principle that an object with refractive index (n3) will scatter an evanescent field created when a light beam undergoes total internal reflection at an interface between two media with different refractive indices, such as glass (n1) and air (n2), where n3>;n2. The key design considerations with respect to development of a TIRM instrument are discussed. In addition the application of TIRM as an optical imaging tool to non-invasively monitor the quality of cells in culture at higher resolution than traditional light microscopy (e.g. bright field and phase contrast imaging) to enable validation of manufacturing procedures in-process will be discussed.",Microscopy;Reflection;Image resolution;Monitoring;Optical microscopy;Educational institutions,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 Functional Optical Imaging,10.1109/FOI.2011.6154840

Computer vision for human stem cell derived cardiomyocyte classification: The induced pluripotent vs embryonic stem cell case study,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) represent a potential valuable alternative to human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) for the lack of ethical issues and their patient-specificity. Recent studies showed hiPSC-CMs behave like hESC-CMs in terms of membrane currents, contractility and frequency of spontaneous pacing but their similarities need to be studied more. In this work we applied a well tested image processing approach based on texture feature extraction (local binary patterns, Haralick features and threshold adjacency statistics) and classification by support vector machines to hiPSC-CMs and hESC-CMs images from contrast phase microscopy. Our results suggested a good discrimination power of the chosen feature set meaning that some structural differences may still remain between the two cell classes.",Motion pictures;Protocols;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Stem cells;Humans;Drugs,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 Computing in Cardiology,
Representing clumps of cell nuclei as unions of elliptic shapes by using the MDL principle,"We discuss the problem of interpreting clumps (or clusters) of nuclei in histological images as unions of elliptical shapes, each ellipse representing one nucleus. The difficult part is to rank various interpretations, involving different numbers of ellipses, and our approach is an information theoretic one where the score for each interpretation is computed using the minimum description length (MDL) principle for a simple parametric family of models. We show how to evaluate MDL for the proposed family using the code-length of an implementable method, which does not involve any asymptotic approximations. We then show how to locally improve the ellipse parameters of a given initial interpretation so that its MDL score is minimized. The initial and final MDL scores of each competing interpretation are then used for deciding which interpretation is the least redundant. We perform a preliminary study involving human subjects for proposing interpretations of the clumps and we also obtain interpretations by an improved version of the existing ellipse fitting algorithm SNEF. We study the variability between the human subject interpretations and compare it with the variability of SNEF algorithm. Finally, the results are examined by a pathology expert for assessing the quality of the MDL based decisions.",Image segmentation;Shape;Encoding;Image coding;Signal processing algorithms;Optimization;Pathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2011,2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference,
A Boosted Bayesian Multiresolution Classifier for Prostate Cancer Detection From Digitized Needle Biopsies,"Diagnosis of prostate cancer (CaP) currently involves examining tissue samples for CaP presence and extent via a microscope, a time-consuming and subjective process. With the advent of digital pathology, computer-aided algorithms can now be applied to disease detection on digitized glass slides. The size of these digitized histology images (hundreds of millions of pixels) presents a formidable challenge for any computerized image analysis program. In this paper, we present a boosted Bayesian multiresolution (BBMR) system to identify regions of CaP on digital biopsy slides. Such a system would serve as an important preceding step to a Gleason grading algorithm, where the objective would be to score the invasiveness and severity of the disease. In the first step, our algorithm decomposes the whole-slide image into an image pyramid comprising multiple resolution levels. Regions identified as cancer via a Bayesian classifier at lower resolution levels are subsequently examined in greater detail at higher resolution levels, thereby allowing for rapid and efficient analysis of large images. At each resolution level, ten image features are chosen from a pool of over 900 first-order statistical, second-order co-occurrence, and Gabor filter features using an AdaBoost ensemble method. The BBMR scheme, operating on 100 images obtained from 58 patients, yielded: 1) areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84, 0.83, and 0.76, respectively, at the lowest, intermediate, and highest resolution levels and 2) an eightfold savings in terms of computational time compared to running the algorithm directly at full (highest) resolution. The BBMR model outperformed (in terms of AUC): 1) individual features (no ensemble) and 2) a random forest classifier ensemble obtained by bagging multiple decision tree classifiers. The apparent drop-off in AUC at higher image resolutions is due to lack of fine detail in the expert annotation of CaP and is not an artifact of the classifier. The implicit feature selection done via the AdaBoost component of the BBMR classifier reveals that different classes and types of image features become more relevant for discriminating between CaP and benign areas at different image resolutions.",Bayesian methods;Prostate cancer;Cancer detection;Needles;Biopsy;Image resolution;Diseases;Image analysis;Classification tree analysis;Microscopy;Computer-aided detection (CAD);histology;prostate cancer (CaP);quantification;supervised classification,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2010.2053540
Spectral Imaging With Scattered Light: From Early Cancer Detection to Cell Biology,"This paper reports the evolution of scanning spectral imaging techniques using scattered light for minimally invasive detection of early cancerous changes in tissue and cell biology applications. Optical spectroscopic techniques have shown promising results in the diagnosis of disease on a cellular scale. They do not require tissue removal, can be performed in vivo, and allow for real-time diagnoses. Fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy are most effective in revealing molecular properties of tissue. Light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) relates the spectroscopic properties of light elastically scattered by small particles, such as epithelial cell nuclei and organelles, to their size, shape, and refractive index. It is capable of characterizing the structural properties of tissue on cellular and subcellular scales. However, in order to be useful in the detection of early cancerous changes that are otherwise not visible to the naked eye, it must rapidly survey a comparatively large area while simultaneously detecting these cellular changes.

Determination of Axonal and Dendritic Orientation Distributions Within the Developing Cerebral Cortex by Diffusion Tensor Imaging,"As neurons of the developing brain form functional circuits, they undergo morphological differentiation. In immature cerebral cortex, radially-oriented cellular processes of undifferentiated neurons impede water diffusion parallel, but not perpendicular, to the pial surface, as measured via diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and give rise to water diffusion anisotropy. As the cerebral cortex matures, the loss of water diffusion anisotropy accompanies cellular morphological differentiation. A quantitative relationship is proposed here to relate water diffusion anisotropy measurements directly to characteristics of neuronal morphology. This expression incorporates the effects of local diffusion anisotropy within cellular processes, as well as the effects of anisotropy in the orientations of cellular processes. To obtain experimental support for the proposed relationship, tissue from 13 and 31 day-old ferrets was stained using the rapid Golgi technique, and the 3-D orientation distribution of neuronal proceses was characterized using confocal microscopic examination of reflected visible light images. Coregistration of the MRI and Golgi data enables a quantitative evaluation of the proposed theory, and excellent agreement with the theoretical results, as well as agreement with previously published values for locally-induced water diffusion anisotropy and volume fraction of the neuropil, is observed.",Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Tensile stress;Diffusion tensor imaging;Nerve fibers;Three dimensional displays;Brain modeling;diffusion tensor imaging (DTI);inverse problems;optical microscopy,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2011.2162099
A Surface-Based 3-D Dendritic Spine Detection Approach From Confocal Microscopy Images,"Determining the relationship between the dendritic spine morphology and its functional properties is a fundamental challenge in neurobiology research. In particular, how to accurately and automatically analyse meaningful structural information from a large microscopy image data set is far away from being resolved. As pointed out in existing literature, one remaining challenge in spine detection and segmentation is how to automatically separate touching spines. In this paper, based on various global and local geometric features of the dendrite structure, we propose a novel approach to detect and segment neuronal spines, in particular, a breaking-down and stitching-up algorithm to accurately separate touching spines. Extensive performance comparisons show that our approach is more accurate and robust than two state-of-the-art spine detection and segmentation algorithms.",Three dimensional displays;Neurons;Surface reconstruction;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Shape;Surface treatment;Microscopy images;normalized cut;spine detection;surface-based segmentation;touching spines,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2011.2166973
Automated Multiscale Morphometry of Muscle Disease From Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy Using Tensor-Based Image Processing,"Practically, all chronic diseases are characterized by tissue remodeling that alters organ and cellular function through changes to normal organ architecture. Some morphometric alterations become irreversible and account for disease progression even on cellular levels. Early diagnostics to categorize tissue alterations, as well as monitoring progression or remission of disturbed cytoarchitecture upon treatment in the same individual, are a new emerging field. They strongly challenge spatial resolution and require advanced imaging techniques and strategies for detecting morphological changes. We use a combined second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy and automated image processing approach to quantify morphology in an animal model of inherited Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( mdx mouse) with age. Multiphoton XYZ image stacks from tissue slices reveal vast morphological deviation in muscles from old mdx mice at different scales of cytoskeleton architecture: cell calibers are irregular, myofibrils within cells are twisted, and sarcomere lattice disruptions (detected as “verniers”) are larger in number compared to samples from healthy mice. In young mdx mice, such alterations are only minor. The boundary-tensor approach, adapted and optimized for SHG data, is a suitable approach to allow quick quantitative morphometry in whole tissue slices. The overall detection performance of the automated algorithm compares very well with manual “ by eye” detection, the latter being time consuming and prone to subjective errors. Our algorithm outperfoms manual detection by time with similar reliability. This approach will be an important prerequisite for the implementation of a clinical image databases to diagnose and monitor specific morphological alterations in chronic (muscle) diseases.",Muscles;Computer architecture;Diseases;Mice;Imaging;Microprocessors;Tensile stress;Automated detection;muscle architecture;second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy;structure analysis,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2011.2167325
Supervoxel-Based Segmentation of Mitochondria in EM Image Stacks With Learned Shape Features,"It is becoming increasingly clear that mitochondria play an important role in neural function. Recent studies show mitochondrial morphology to be crucial to cellular physiology and synaptic function and a link between mitochondrial defects and neuro-degenerative diseases is strongly suspected. Electron microscopy (EM), with its very high resolution in all three directions, is one of the key tools to look more closely into these issues but the huge amounts of data it produces make automated analysis necessary. State-of-the-art computer vision algorithms designed to operate on natural 2-D images tend to perform poorly when applied to EM data for a number of reasons. First, the sheer size of a typical EM volume renders most modern segmentation schemes intractable. Furthermore, most approaches ignore important shape cues, relying only on local statistics that easily become confused when confronted with noise and textures inherent in the data. Finally, the conventional assumption that strong image gradients always correspond to object boundaries is violated by the clutter of distracting membranes. In this work, we propose an automated graph partitioning scheme that addresses these issues. It reduces the computational complexity by operating on supervoxels instead of voxels, incorporates shape features capable of describing the 3-D shape of the target objects, and learns to recognize the distinctive appearance of true boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to segment mitochondria at a performance level close to that of a human annotator, and outperforms a state-of-the-art 3-D segmentation technique.",Image segmentation;Shape;Feature extraction;Three dimensional displays;Image edge detection;Microscopy;Image resolution;Electron microscopy (EM);mitochondria;segmentation;shape features;supervoxels,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2011.2171705
Forensic Detection of Fraudulent Alteration in Ball-Point Pen Strokes,"Alteration and addition to valuable data on paper documents are among the fastest growing crimes around the globe. The loss due to these crimes is huge and is increasing with an alarming rate. The techniques, which are used by forensic document examiners, to examine such cases are still limited to manual examination of physical, chemical and microscopic characteristics. Moreover, it is very difficult to detect an alteration when the ink of similar color is involved. We could not find much in the literature to deal with this problem in an automated pattern recognition framework. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to alterations made with ball-point pen strokes and propose a scheme for detection of such alterations using pattern recognition tools. For this, a large set of color and texture based features is extracted. To choose an adequate set of useful features from the extracted ones, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based feature analysis technique is used. For detection of the alteration, three different classifiers, namely, K-nearest neighbor, MLP and support vector machines are used. The results are quite promising.",Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Forensics;Ink;Image color analysis;Chemicals;Organizations;Alteration detection;feature analysis;fraudulent addition;moment feature;pattern recognition;texture feature,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,10.1109/TIFS.2011.2176119
Automatic detection of subcellular particles in fluorescence microscopy via feature clustering and bayesian analysis,"Recent advancement in live cell fluorescence microscopy has enabled image acquisition at single particle resolution, through which biologists can investigate the underlying mechanisms of cellular processes. In this paper, we present a method to automatically detect the features of sub-cellular particles in 2D fluorescence images, including x-y positions, fluorescence intensities, and relative sizes. The method consists of two parts. One is an initial detection method, which finds particle candidates in the images using image filters and clustering algorithms. The other is a MAP-Bayesian based estimation method, which provides the optimal estimations of particle features. The method is evaluated on synthetic data and results show that it has high accuracy. The results on real data confirmed by human expert cell biologists are also presented.",Estimation;Microscopy;Signal to noise ratio;Biology;Accuracy;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 IEEE Workshop on Mathematical Methods in Biomedical Image Analysis,10.1109/MMBIA.2012.6164750
Multilevel Segmentation of Histopathological Images Using Cooccurrence of Tissue Objects,"This paper presents a new approach for unsupervised segmentation of histopathological tissue images. This approach has two main contributions. First, it introduces a new set of high-level texture features to represent the prior knowledge of spatial organization of the tissue components. These texture features are defined on the tissue components, which are approximately represented by tissue objects, and quantify the frequency of two component types being cooccurred in a particular spatial relationship. As they are defined on components, rather than on image pixels, these object cooccurrence features are expected to be less vulnerable to noise and variations that are typically observed at the pixel level of tissue images. Second, it proposes to obtain multiple segmentations by multilevel partitioning of a graph constructed on the tissue objects and combine them by an ensemble function. This multilevel graph partitioning algorithm introduces randomization in graph construction and refinements in its multilevel scheme to increase diversity of individual segmentations, and thus, improve the final result. The experiments on 200 colon tissue images reveal that the proposed approach-the object cooccurrence features together with the multilevel segmentation algorithm-is effective to obtain high-quality results. The experiments also show that it improves the segmentation results compared to the previous approaches.",Image segmentation;Partitioning algorithms;Feature extraction;Bipartite graph;Biomedical imaging;Classification algorithms;Training;Histopathological image analysis;image segmentation;multilevel segmentation;segmentation ensemble;texture,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2012.2191784
Identify malaria parasite using pattern recognition technique,"Moving with the technological advancement in the field of bio imaging processing this paper presents an innovative digital technique detecting parasitic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. Traditionally, in clinical laboratories the direct microscopic prediction of the parasite on the thick and/or thin blood smears are used for the diagnosis of malaria. It involves collection of a blood smear, its staining with Romanowsky stains and examination of the Red Blood Cells for intracellular malarial parasites. In blood samples, if the red corpuscles of vertebrates are infected by malarial parasites, they will have a specific shape which can identify their presence. Recent research has suggested that the shape of the affected red blood cells can be detected using the 2D moments of the image of the infected cell. In this paper an algorithm is implemented to identify the type of parasite through their color and shape. This technique can detect the existence of malaria parasite within seconds and thus can replace the conventional methods of detection of malaria in bio-medical applications and medical science. The proposed method can automatically diagnose the parasite's presence using the algorithm mentioned which consumes less time and man power as compare to conventional methods.",Diseases;Blood;Shape;Image edge detection;Image color analysis;Humans;Algorithm design and analysis;pattern recognition;malaria;parasite,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,"2012 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Applications",10.1109/ICCCA.2012.6179129
"An Integrated Region-, Boundary-, Shape-Based Active Contour for Multiple Object Overlap Resolution in Histological Imagery","Active contours and active shape models (ASM) have been widely employed in image segmentation. A major limitation of active contours, however, is in their 1) inability to resolve boundaries of intersecting objects and to 2) handle occlusion. Multiple overlapping objects are typically segmented out as a single object. On the other hand, ASMs are limited by point correspondence issues since object landmarks need to be identified across multiple objects for initial object alignment. ASMs are also are constrained in that they can usually only segment a single object in an image. In this paper, we present a novel synergistic boundary and region-based active contour model that incorporates shape priors in a level set formulation with automated initialization based on watershed. We demonstrate an application of these synergistic active contour models using multiple level sets to segment nuclear and glandular structures on digitized histopathology images of breast and prostate biopsy specimens. Unlike previous related approaches, our model is able to resolve object overlap and separate occluded boundaries of multiple objects simultaneously. The energy functional of the active contour is comprised of three terms. The first term is the prior shape term, modeled on the object of interest, thereby constraining the deformation achievable by the active contour. The second term, a boundary-based term detects object boundaries from image gradients. The third term drives the shape prior and the contour towards the object boundary based on region statistics. The results of qualitative and quantitative evaluation on 100 prostate and 14 breast cancer histology images for the task of detecting and segmenting nuclei and lymphocytes reveals that the model easily outperforms two state of the art segmentation schemes (geodesic active contour and Rousson shape-based model) and on average is able to resolve up to 91% of overlapping/occluded structures in the images.",Shape;Level set;Training;Image segmentation;Active contours;Principal component analysis;Vectors;Active contours (ACs);breast;digital pathology;histopathology;hybrid segmentation models;prostate;shape prior;statistical shape models,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2012.2190089
Identification of Chinese Materia Medicas in microscopic powder images,"This paper describes an identification system for Chinese Materia Medicas (CMMs) in microscopic powder images. The imaging processing of the microscopic powder image is very complex because of the low contrast, blurry boundaries, overlapping objects, and messy background. Therefore, the object detection must segment the significant microscopic structures from the complex image. The objects are detected in these images using an adaptable interactive method. After identifying the significant microscopic structures, the system identifies 14 features belonging to three main characteristics. These features form a 14-dimensional vector that represents the microscopic structures. The multi-dimensional vector is then analyzed using a feature assignment algorithm that picks the most notable features to construct a decision tree with thresholds. The identification system consists of a coarse classifier based on the decision tree and a fine classifier using similarity measurements to rank the possible results. Tests on 528 images from 24 different kinds of microscopic structures show the system effectiveness and applicability.",Microscopy;Powders;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Biomedical imaging;Object detection;Feature extraction;Chinese Materia Medicas;microscopic characteristics;microscopic images;object detection;texture characteristics,ARTICLE,2012,Tsinghua Science and Technology,10.1109/TST.2012.6180047

Automatic detection of malignant cells in soft tissues from microscopic images,"The automatic detection of malignant cells in soft tissues with the help of medical images assists the pathologists in histopathology diagnosis to confirm cancer.

To evaluate the segmentation process, an objective quantitative evaluation function F for the segmented textured images using Gabor FCM, KM, Th (GFCM, GKM, GTh) is determined by varying number of regions.

Data mining techniques for AFM- based tumor classification,"The present paper deals with the application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) as a tool for morphological characterization of histological brain tumor samples. Data mining techniques will be applied for automatic identification of brain tumor tissues based on AFM images by means of classifying grade II and IV tumors. The rapid advancement of AFM in recent years turned it into a valuable and useful tool to determine the topography of surface nanoscale structures with high precision. Therefore, it is used in a variety of applications in life science, materials science, electrochemistry, polymer science, biophysics, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. Minkowski functionals are used (in particular the Euler- Poincaré characteristic) as a feature descriptor to characterize global geometric structures in images related to the topology of the AFM image. In order to improve classification accuracy on the one hand, but to infer interpretable information from AFM images for domain experts on the other hand, feature analysis and reduction will be applied. From a data mining point of view, Genetic Programming will be introduced as a sophisticated method for both feature analysis and reduction as well as for producing highly accurate and interpretable models.

Tumor vascular permeability measurement based on color image analysis,"Characteristic of microscopy vascular data is that it contains many tiny vessels with branching and complex structure. The quantification of these vascular network is crucial in diagnose of vascular abnormalities, surgical planning, and monitoring disease progress or remission. Therefore, developing an image processing method to automatically and accurately quantify the vessel is important. We are researching two algorithms here to isolate the pixels that represent the vessels. Each algorithm has a specific role to play in the extraction of the vessels. The first algorithm uses color ratios to segment vessels and the second helps compensate for light balance issues by breaking the image into segments.

Development of a novel 2D color map for interactive segmentation of histological images,"We present a color segmentation approach based on a two-dimensional color map derived from the input image. Pathologists stain tissue biopsies with various colored dyes to see the expression of biomarkers. In these images, because of color variation due to inconsistencies in experimental procedures and lighting conditions, the segmentation used to analyze biological features is usually ad-hoc. Many algorithms like K-means use a single metric to segment the image into different color classes and rarely provide users with powerful color control. Our 2D color map interactive segmentation technique based on human color perception information and the color distribution of the input image, enables user control without noticeable delay. Our methodology works for different staining types and different types of cancer tissue images. Our proposed method's results show good accuracy with low response and computational time making it a feasible method for user interactive applications involving segmentation of histological images.",Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Visualization;Data visualization;Level set;Color segmentation;Cellular;Nuclear;Histology;Staining;CAD,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235513
Multifractal feature descriptor for diagnosing liver and prostate cancers in H&E stained histologic images,"Histologic imaging plays an important role in discriminating cancerous tissues of several body organs. However, the human histopathological examinations may be subjective and error prone, because of the complexity of the appearances of the histologic texture. These limitations can be overcome by adopting quantitative computational methods with human histopathological examination routines. This study proposes a new feature descriptor to characterize texture of histologic images. The proposed method derives a discriminative feature space by observing the self-similarity characteristics of the texture based on fractal geometry. The merit of utilizing fractal geometry to describe the histologic texture is assessed by a classification experiment. The experimental results indicate that the proposed feature descriptor can classify cancer and non-cancer tissues of histologic images of liver and prostate images around 95% of correct classification rate.",Fractals;Cancer;Dictionaries;Liver;Feature extraction;Indexes;Equations;Histology;Fractal;Multifractal;Feature descriptors;Classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235543
Optimizing the design of FT-IR spectroscopic imaging instruments to obtain increased spatial resolution of chemical species,"Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging provides spatially resolved chemical information. Recent developments have shown that this chemical information can be used to determine tissue cell types. Our goal is then to use the spatial distribution of tissue cell types to perform accurate diagnosis of cancer. However, this step is limited by the spatial resolution provided by current imaging systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that these instruments can be designed to provide better spatial resolution for tissue chemistry. We present an optical model for the propagation of light through an FT-IR spectroscopic imaging system. Using this model, we minimally modify an existing FT-IR spectroscopic imaging system to obtain significantly higher resolution and image quality. We demonstrate that it is possible to identify previously obscured tissue types by performing histological classification based on bio-chemically derived spectral features (metrics).",Imaging;Chemicals;Instruments;Spatial resolution;Cancer;Detectors,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235557
Image segmentation with implicit color standardization using cascaded EM: Detection of myelodysplastic syndromes,"Color nonstandardness - the propensity for similar objects to exhibit different color properties across images - poses a significant problem in the computerized analysis of histopathology. Though many papers propose means for improving color constancy, the vast majority assume image formation via reflective light instead of light transmission as in microscopy, and thus are inappropriate for histological analysis. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian color segmentation algorithm for histological images that is highly robust to color nonstandardness; this algorithm employs a unique instantiation of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to dynamically estimate - for each individual image - the probability density functions (mixtures of gamma and von Mises distributions) that describe the colors of salient objects. To validate our segmentation scheme, we employ it as part of a computerized system to detect myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) on bone marrow specimens. Qualitative anecdotal evidence suggests that biopsies of MDS exhibit abnormalities in the arrangement of erythroid precursors (immature red blood cells). Herein, we confirm and quantify this phenomenon, using it to discriminate MDS from normal tissue: over a dataset of 53 representative regions selected from 18 patients, our classification system correctly discriminates MDS from normal tissue with an accuracy of 85% and an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.8803.",Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Bones;Standards;Histograms;Bayesian methods;Maximum likelihood estimation,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235654

Axon extraction from fluorescent confocal microscopy images,"The morphological analysis of axonal trees is an important problem in neuroscience. The first step for such an analysis is the extraction of the axon. Due to the high volume of generated image data and the tortuous nature of the axons, manual processing is not feasible. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniques for the automatic extraction of the neuronal structures. In this paper we present a new approach for the automatic extraction of axons from fluorescent confocal microscopy images. It combines algorithms for filament enhancement, binarization, skeletonization and gap filling in a pipeline capable of extracting the axons. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on real images. Results support the potential use of this technique in helping biologists perform automatic extraction of axons from fluorescent confocal microscopy images.",Nerve fibers;Image segmentation;Tensile stress;Microscopy;Skeleton;axon extraction;fluorescent confocal microscopy;Gabor functions;tensor voting,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235660
Batch-invariant nuclear segmentation in whole mount histology sections,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a rich repository of whole mount tumor sections that are collected from different laboratories. However, there are a significant amount of technical and biological variations that impede analysis. We have developed a novel approach for nuclear segmentation in histology sections, which addresses the problem of technical and biological variations by incorporating information from manually annotated reference patches with the local color space of the original image. Subsequently, the problem is formulated within a multi-reference graph cut with geodesic constraints. This approach has been validated on manually curated samples and then applied to a dataset of 440 whole mount tissue sections, originating from different laboratories, which are typically 40k-by-40k pixels or larger.

Molecular bases of morphometric composition in Glioblastoma multiforme,"Integrated analysis of tissue histology with the genome-wide array (e.g., OMIC) and clinical data have the potential for hypothesis generation and be prognostic. OMIC and clinical data are typically characterized and summarized at the patient level while whole mount histological sections are often heterogeneous in terms of nuclear morphology and organization. In this paper, we propose a multilevel framework for summarization and association of morphometric data. At the lowest level, each nucleus is segmented and then profiled with a multi-dimensional representation. At the intermediate level, cellular profiles are summarized within a local neighborhood, and further clustered into subtypes. At the highest level, each patient is represented by the composition of subtypes that are computed from the intermediate level, and then integrated with OMIC and outcome data for further analysis. The framework has been applied to Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Based on cellularity and nuclear size, four subtypes have been identified at the intermediate level. Subsequent multi-variate survival analysis indicates that the patient composition of one of the subtypes, with extremely low cellularity and small nucleus size, has a significantly higher hazard ratio. Further correlation of this subtype with the molecular data reveals enrichment of (i) STAT3 pathway and (ii) common regulators of PKC, TNF, AGT, and PDGF.",Tumors;Bioinformatics;Genomics;Hazards;Mathematical model;Cancer;Labeling;Tumor architecture;Cox proportional-hazards model;consensus clustering;molecular association,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235889

Detection and classification of parasite eggs for use in helminthic therapy,"Eggs from the small, intestinal pig whipworm Trichuris suis constitute the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a novel type of medicine for chronic autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease. The pharmaceutical potency of such an egg suspension can be assessed by microscopic inspection, as only eggs containing a viable, infective larva provoke the wanted immune reaction. Thus, a precise and objective estimate of the concentration of infective eggs is crucial for dosing the new medicine. In this paper, a vision-based method for detecting and classifying T. suis parasite eggs is described. The detection is based on matched filters and the classification is done using linear and quadratic discriminant analysis on a set of biologically inspired features, including the autocorrelation-based longitudinal anisotropy and the mean scattering intensity under dark field illumination. Despite the presence of impurities and overlapping eggs, the proposed method achieves cross-validated classification rates around 93%.",Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Scattering;Impurities;Diseases;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Humans;elliptic filters;longitudinal anisotropy;mean scattering intensity;linear discriminant analysis;Trichuris suis eggs,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235888
Object localization in medical images based on graphical model with contrast and interest-region terms,"In this paper, we propose a novel method for object localization, generally applicable to medical images in which the objects can be distinguished from the background mainly based on feature differences. We design a new CRF model with additional contrast and interest-region potentials, which encode the higher-order contextual information between regions, on the global and structural levels. We also propose a sparse-coding based classification approach for the interest-region detection with discriminative dictionaries, to serve as a second opinion for more accurate region labeling. We evaluate our object localization method on two medical imaging applications: lesion dissimilarity on thoracic PET-CT images, and cell segmentation on microscopic images. Our evaluations show higher performance when comparing to recently reported approaches.",Labeling;Lesions;Support vector machines;Dictionaries;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Vectors,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops,10.1109/CVPRW.2012.6239240
A contour extraction method of coke optical texture based on edge confidence map,"Contour information is an important feature in recognition of coke microscopic optical texture. In view of the characteristic of coke microscopic, a contour extraction method, which is based on joint edge confidence map and dual threshold, is proposed. At first, an edge confidence map with gradient magnitude and orientation is built, then non-maximum suppression is employed to obtain local external points; by setting dual thresholds and judge location of points, appropriate edge points are obtained; by tracking these edge points, contour is formed. In this method, parameters can be auto-adjusted. Experimental results show, with the proposed method, the weak contour can be detected, continuity and fine details of contours of different optical texture components can be preserved, which is an important basis of subsequent contour feature extraction and corresponding optical texture component recognition.",Image edge detection;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Joints;Optical imaging;Optical devices;Optical microscopy;Optical texture of coke;Edge confidence map;Contour extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 24th Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC),10.1109/CCDC.2012.6244456
"Expressions of CD151, Integrin alpha3 beta1 and MMP7 in Breast Cancer Tissue Microarray and their Clinicopathological Significance","Purpose: CD151, one of tetraspanins has been suggested to regulate cancer invasion and metastasis. We examined whether it is expressed in primary breast carcinoma and whether has relation with integrina3e1 and MMP7. Methods: By using immunohisto chemical S-P method, the expressions of CD151, integrina3e1 and MMP7 proteins in breast cancer tissue micro array (TMA) were tested. Their correlations with clinicopathological features were analyzed. The relationship among three proteins was also analyzed. Comparison between qualitative data was performed using Chi-square test. Results: The positive rates of CD151, integrina3e1 and MMP7 expressions were 0.0% (0/39) , 7.7%(3/39)and 10.3% (4/39) in normal breast tissue, respectively, 33.3% (10/30) , 30%(9/30) and 40.0% (12/30) in tissues of carcinoma in situ, respectively, 59.0%(59/100), 70.0%(70/100) and 70.0% (70/100) in cancerous tissues, respectively. The differences of three kinds of protein expression rates among the three groups were significant (λ2 =41.276, λ2=48.618, λ2 =41.801). The expressions of three proteins in breast cancer tissues weren't associated with patient's ages and the histological type (P>;0.05). But they significantly related with differentiated degree of cancer tissue, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (p(p<;0.05). Furthermore, CD151 and integrina3β1 expressions significantly related with tumor size. CD151 expression significantly related with ER/PR expression. The expression of CD151 was positively correlated with MMP7 and integrina3β1 expression(Kappa= 0.418, Kappa =0.461). CD151 positive patients had higher rates of recurrence and metastasis than CD151negative patients(χ2=5.937 , P=0.015). Conclusions: The expressions of CD151 and integrina3β1 and MMP7 were over expressed in breast carcinoma, which suggested that three proteinswere related to carcinogenesis, development, invasion and metastasis. CD151 was positively correlated with integrina3β1 and MMP7 in breast cancer, which suggested that CD151 regulated integrin and MMP pathway.

Neurosphere fate prediction: An analysis-synthesis approach for feature extraction,"The study of stem cells is one of the current most important biomedical research field. Understanding their development could allow multiple applications in regenerative medicine. For this purpose, we need automated methods for the segmentation and the modeling of neural stem cell development process into a neurosphere colony from phase contrast microscopy. We use such methods to extract relevant structural and textural features like cell division dynamism and cell behavior patterns for biological interpretation. The combination of phase contrast imaging, high fragility and complex evolution of neural stem cells pose many challenges in image processing and image analysis. This study introduces an on-line analysis method for the modeling of neurosphere evolution during the first three days of their development. From the corresponding time-lapse sequences, we extract information from the neurosphere using a combination of fast level set and curve detection for segmenting the cells. Then, based on prior biological knowledge, we generate possible and optimal 3-dimensional configuration using registration and evolutionary optimisation algorithm.",Solid modeling;Biological system modeling;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Data models;Stem cells,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252628
Automatic Identification of Malaria-Infected RBC With Digital Holographic Microscopy Using Correlation Algorithms,"Diagnosis of malaria is important for its medication and treatment. An automatic compact diagnostic tool will be advantageous especially for healthcare personnel working in developing countries, which lack trained professionals and high-quality equipments. Digital holographic microscopy is one of the advanced techniques for quantitative evaluation of cells, providing cell thickness information directly. This information obtained by interferometric comparison can be used to identify as well as to compare cells. Here, we describe the use of digital holographic interferometric microscopy (DHIM) with numerical focusing for automatic identification of malaria-infected red blood cells (RBCs).

Classification of Endomicroscopic Images of the Lung Based on Random Subwindows and Extra-Trees,"Recently, the in vivo imaging of pulmonary alveoli was made possible thanks to confocal microscopy. For these images, we wish to aid the clinician by developing a computer-aided diagnosis system, able to discriminate between healthy and pathological subjects. The lack of expertise currently available on these images has first led us to choose a generic approach, based on pixel-value description of randomly extracted subwindows and decision tree ensemble for classification (extra-trees). In order to deal with the great complexity of our images, we adapt this method by introducing a texture-based description of the subwindows, based on local binary patterns. We show through our experimental protocol that this adaptation is a promising way to classify fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy images. In addition, we introduce a rejection mechanism on the classifier output to prevent nondetection errors.",Feature extraction;Vegetation;Pathology;Lungs;Vectors;Training;Decision trees;Confocal fluorescence microscopy;extra-trees;image classification;medical imaging;reject rule,ARTICLE,2012,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2012.2204747

Glioblastoma multiforme treated by the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide in vivo: a 4D simulation model of the tumor response,"A novel four dimensional, patient specific simulation model of solid tumor response to chemotherapeutic treatment in vivo is presented. The special case of glioblastoma multiforme treated by temozolomide is addressed as a simulation paradigm. The model is based on the patient's imaging, histopathologic and genetic data. For a given drug administration schedule lying within acceptable toxicity boundaries, the concentration of the prodrug and its metabolites within the tumor is calculated as a function of time based on the drug pharmacokinetics. A discretization mesh is superimposed upon the anatomical region of interest and within each geometrical cell of the mesh the most prominent biological ""laws"" are applied. The biological cell fates are predicted based on the drug pharmacodynamics. The outcome of the simulation is a prediction of the spatiotemporal activity of the entire tumor and is virtual reality visualized. A good qualitative agreement of the model's predictions with clinical experience has strengthened the applicability of the approach. Long term clinical and quantitative adaptation and validation as well as modeling the normal tissue reactions are in progress.

Image Analysis of Breast Tumors Using Thermal Texture Mapping (TTM),"To explore the characteristics of thermo-source of breast tumors on Thermal Texture Maps. Compared with the histological results, thermo-source characteristics on TTM in 106 cases with breast mass, who would undergo breast surgery, were analyzed according to the parameters such as the depth, morphology, structure, and temperatures of abnormal heat foci in order to find the differences between benign diseases and malignant tumors. The coincidence rates of Thermal Texture Maps with pathological findings and the corresponding thermo-eradiate values in 49 cases with malignancy and 57 cases with benign diseases were 89.5% and 91.9%, 2.599 and 1.822 (P < 0.001), respectively. The statistics differences were significant between the two groups. Contrast sharply with benign diseases, there were irregular morphology, denser structures, higher thermo-eradiate values in malignant tumors.

Virtual Mouse Placenta: Tissue Layer Segmentation,"Microscopic imaging is an important phenotyping tool to characterize the phenotype (e.g., morphology and behavior) change caused by genotype manipulation such as mutation and gene knockout. Recently we use high resolution microscopic imaging to study the morphological change on mouse placenta induced by retinoblast (Rb) gene knockout. In order to assess the morphological change we first segment each microscopic image into regions corresponding to different tissue types. Due to the complex structure of these tissues and large variation among the more than 2,000 images, we design a Bayesian supervised segmentation method which utilizing image features of all levels.

Texture Segmentation of Endometrial Images for Aiding Diagnosis of Hyperplasia,"The process of discriminating among benign and malignant hyperplasia begun with subjective methods using light microscopy and now is continuing with computerized morphometrical analysis that needs some features. One of the main features called volume percentage of stroma (VPS) is gained by calculating the percentage of stroma texture. Currently, this feature is calculated by pathologists on a manual basis. The algorithm here can automatically calculate VPS with a good precision. In this paper we proposed a method for segmentation of this texture based on Gabor wavelets and mathematical morphology. Gabor wavelets attain maximum joint space-frequency resolution which is highly significant in the process of texture segmentation. The ability of Gabor filters in discrimination of texture bands at different scales and orientations has been used to segment stroma texture which is mainly located in middle frequency bands from glandular elements.

High throughput microscopy: from images to data,"For academic scientists, high throughput microscopy enables a paradigm shift from labor intensive qualitative microscopy to fast image-based quantitative biology. For pharmaceutical scientists, it enables replacing whole-well averaged readouts of simple cellular biomarkers with multiplexed cellular systems biological screens that include cell subpopulation and morphological characteristics. For research pathologists, the future looks bright for automating the process of reading and scoring tissue microarrays, which consist of a few hundred to a few thousand tissue sections on each slide. For image-based (or high content) screening, various algorithms have been developed to perform the automated cytometry needed to assess compound hits and/or dose responses. For many other drug screening and academic biological assays and for tissue microarrays, substantial challenges remain to be solved by more advanced image analysis techniques.

Automated multivariate profiling of drug effects from fluorescence microscopy images,"Fluorescence microscopy is a useful tool for building quantitative profiles of drug effects. Although features with rich information can be extracted from fluorescence microscopy images, most current profiling methods build profiles from the extracted features using either univariate or non-automated methods. We propose a new multivariate, automated and scalable method for building drug profiles by using a decision hyperplane. The method was evaluated by using 23 compounds belonging to four groups of known mechanisms. We produced quantitative profiles that group drugs with similar mechanisms together, and separate drugs with dissimilar mechanisms from each other. These profiles resulted in better characterizations of the drug effects than profiles obtained from a previous univariate method",Drugs;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Data mining;Feature extraction;Proteins;DNA;Shape measurement;Humans;Biomedical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro, 2006.",10.1109/ISBI.2006.1624900
Segmentation of vasculature for intravital microscopy using bridging vessel snake,"Robustly segmenting vessels even with less sharp boundary is important for achieving accurate biological analysis of blood vessels regulation within organs such as liver. This process is crucial for microvaculature reconstruction which is necessary for red blood cells flow distribution regulation analysis. The vessels with sharp edges are often used during manual analysis skewing the data toward a certain group of vessels. In this paper, we propose bridging vessel snake (BVS) for segmenting a network of vessels (especially ones with less sharp boundary) in intravital microscopy images. Our method enables segmentation of vessels with varying diameter while imposing the structure of vessels by utilizing a ribbon snake and adding energies of width and region. The initialization achieved by the skeletonization is used to segment mostly sharper vessels. The ""bridges"" between the segmentation of sharper (thus higher confidence) vessels are used for hypothesizing less sharp vessels. A preliminary evaluation against a manual ground truth using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve reveals that the algorithm was able to improve the area under ROC curve up to 20% on the vessels with lower sharpness and achieve the area under a ROC in all ground truthed vessels of 0.90.",Microscopy;Image segmentation;Robustness;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging;Liver;Image reconstruction;Red blood cells;Data analysis;Bridges,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro, 2006.",10.1109/ISBI.2006.1624881
Topology preserving STACS segmentation of protein subcellular location images,"We present an algorithm for the segmentation of multicell fluorescence microscopy images. Such images abound and a segmentation algorithm robust to different experimental conditions as well as cell types is becoming a necessity. In cellular imaging, among the most often used segmentation algorithms is seeded watershed. One of its features is that it tends to oversegment, splitting the cells, as well as create segmented regions much larger than a true cell. This can be an advantage (the entire cell is within the region) as well as a disadvantage (a large amount of background noise is included). We present an algorithm which segments with tight contours by building upon an active contour algorithm - STACS, by Pluempitiwiriyawej et al. We adapt the algorithm to suit the needs of our data and use another technique, topology preservation by Han et al., to build our topology preserving STACS (TPSTACS).

Joint texture and topography estimation for extended depth of field in brightfield microscopy,"Brightfield microscopy often suffers from limited depth of field, which prevents thick specimens from being imaged entirely in-focus. By optically sectioning the specimen, the in-focus regions can be acquired over multiple images. Extended depth of field methods aim at combining the information from these images into a single in-focus image of the texture on the specimen's surface. The topography provided by these methods is limited to a map of the selected in-focus image for every pixel and is inherently discretized, which limits its use for quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we propose a joint texture and topography estimation, based on an image formation model for a thick specimen incorporating the point spread function. The problem is stated as a least-squares fitting where the texture and the topography are updated alternately. The method also acts as a deconvolution operation when the in-focus image has some blur left, or when the true in-focus position falls in-between two slices.

Microscopic image classification via ℂWT-based covariance descriptors using Kullback-Leibler distance,"In this paper, we present a novel method for classification of cancer cell line images using complex wavelet-based region covariance matrix descriptors. Microscopic images containing irregular carcinoma cell patterns are represented by randomly selected subwindows which possibly correspond to foreground pixels. For each subwindow, a new region descriptor utilizing the dual-tree complex wavelet transform coefficients as pixel features is computed. ℂWT as a feature extraction tool is preferred primarily because of its ability to characterize singularities at multiple orientations, which often arise in carcinoma cell lines, and approximate shift invariance property. We propose new dissimilarity measures between covariance matrices based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and L2-norm, which turn out to be as successful as the classical KL divergence, but with much less computational complexity.

Method to support diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) based on structural analysis of histological images,"Histopathology is considered one of the most important tools for diagnosis in medical routine. It is characterized by the study of structural and morphological changes of the cells, caused by diseases in biological tissues. The use of computational techniques in the processing of histopathological images allows the identification of structural elements as well as the determination of inherent characteristics, supporting the study of the structural organization of tissues and their pathological changes.

Histology-based oral lesion classification,"A computer aided diagnosis (CADx) system for classification of oral cavity lesions from histological images based upon image analysis and pattern recognition has been developed. The aim was to discriminate normal tissue against two of the common and potentially precancerous lesions, Oral Lichen Planus and Oral Submucous Fibrosis, using SVM and kNN classifiers. We proposed to investigate the histogram-based properties of the tissue as discriminating features. Also, two color representation modalities (RGB and HSV) were used to evaluate their discriminative power for analysis of histological images. Relying only on the histogram features, the overall classification accuracy was 83.7% with sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 74%, respectively. Employing the color systems, the best result was achieved in the HSV system (78% accuracy).",Erbium;Entropy;Integrated circuits;oral lesions;histological images;image classification;histogram,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,20th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE2012),10.1109/IranianCEE.2012.6292619
Concavity degree: A new feature for chromosome centromere localization,"Analyzing the features of the chromosomes can be very useful for diagnosis of many genetic disorders or prediction of the possible abnormalities that may occur in the future generations. For this purpose, karyotype is often used which to make it, there is necessary to identify each one of the 24 chromosomes from the microscopic images. Definition and extraction of the morphological and band pattern based features for each chromosome is the first step to identify them. An important class of the morphological features is the location of the chromosome's centromere. Thus, centromere localization is an initial step in designing an automatic karyotyping system. In this paper, a novel algorithm for centromere localization is presented. The procedure is based on the calculation and analyzing the concavity degree for the boundary pixels of the chromosomes. In this method, the centerline of the chromosome is computed and the score of each pixel on the centerline is considered as the sum of the concavity degree of two pixels on the chromosome's boundary that are perpendicular to it. Finally, location of the centromere is estimated as one pixel on the centerline which is corresponding to the maximum score. When applied the proposed algorithm on 50 images, an average error of 2.25 pixels for centromere localization is achieved.",Biological cells;Image segmentation;Noise;Skeleton;Polynomials;Microscopy;Diseases;Chromosome's Centromere;Concavity Degree;Centerline;Polynomial Fitting;Karyotyping,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,The 16th CSI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP 2012),10.1109/AISP.2012.6313718
Compressive feedback based non-vector space control,"A non-vector space control method based on compressive feedback is presented in this paper. The non-vector space means the control is not performed in traditional vector space but in the space of sets. Consider an initial set and a goal set, a stabilizing controller is designed to make the set dynamics converge to the goal set. The compressive feedback means the controller works even when only partial elements of the feedback set are available; that is, the same controller can still stabilize the set dynamics around the goal set with the compressive feedback. The controller is applied to visual servoing by considering images as sets. In this way, image processing for feature extraction is not required, which is an essential process in conventional servo methods. Moreover, the compressive feedback can reduce the size of feedback image. It is important when the sampling is time consuming such as imaging using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The visual servoing formulation of the controller is further applied to the motion control in nanomanipulations. Simulation results suggest good performance of the controller. The framework proposed in this paper can be extended to other systems where the signals can be represented as sets.",Aerospace electronics;Vectors;Image coding;Visual servoing;Sparse matrices;Feature extraction;Compressed sensing,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 American Control Conference (ACC),10.1109/ACC.2012.6315676
Image-guided spectroscopy of cancer: Translating optical technology into clinical tools,"Integration of localized molecular spectroscopy into standard medical imaging instrumentation has been slow in developing, yet today there have been major developments which make it achievable on a routine basis. Perhaps the most striking thing about optical imaging is the incredibly wide range of technologies available, and the correspondingly large range of resolutions in which they target, from microscopic imaging at 1 micron resolution, upto macroscopic imaging with 1-5mm resolution. The choice of technology must be done for the application desired. In cancer diagnosis and therapy monitoring, MR spectroscopy of tumors is done routinely in some centers, and the potential for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is also available. The American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) has sponsored the first multicenter trial in NIRS to track response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. NIRS can also be combined with image-guided recovery of the tissue components, using standard MR images, to quantify the spectroscopic features of breast cancer. A prototype system integrating NIRS into a 3T MR breast coil is outlined, and the ongoing study using the MR image as the template upon with spectroscopy is completed will be presented, with results from neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring. In radiology research, two prototype systems broadband spectral imaging of tissue are discussed, and it is shown that the spectral tomography system is ideal for fluorescence or emission tomography in vivo. This type of hybrid imaging is still in its infancy, yet using it to guide therapy or to properly individualize therapy choice is the next logical step. Use of MRI or CT as the backbone technology to exploit NIRS is a logical step for integration of this modality into clinical use. Imaging of molecular features is provided by this approach, such as Raman vibrational fingerprint of bone tissue, and uptake of multiple exogenous fluorescent agents in the same subject. Additional examples of how emission tomography could guide radiation therapy are demonstrated. In imaging for surgical guidance, molecular tracers such as Epidermal Growth Factor and Protoporphyrin IX are shown to be increased in glioma tumors, and are providing actually superior detection of the tumor tissue using standard white light surgical guidance. The state of the art in fluorescence guidance of surgery will be discussed, as well as future directions looking for peptide markers which could be translated to other tumor organ sites.",Imaging;Spectroscopy;Educational institutions;Surgery;Tumors;Cancer;Standards,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO),10.1364/CLEO_AT.2012.ATh4C.1
Patch-based feature maps for pixel-level image segmentation,"In this paper, we describe the use of phase-invariant complex wavelet filters, coupled to a training process involving a small, high-quality training dataset, to build an image segmentation system capable of performing in very low signal-to-noise, and under conditions of strong object-background contrast change. The three main components of our approach are: i) a patch-based feature description of local phase-invariant orientation fields; ii) a priori ground-truth data; iii) a machine learning method, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) or kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM), to build an accurate classifier that is customised to the segmentation problem. A key feature of the approach is that it may be easily retrained and is, therefore, more adaptable to different imaging modalities. A representation of phase-invariant local image orientation using geometric algebra is first introduced; this is important to the patch-based approach. The quality of our trained systems is then assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves in two different biomedical applications: the human retinal vessel-bed in colour fundus images from the publicly available DRIVE database, and the rabbit endothelial cell boundaries of thoracic aorta microscopy images.",Training;Image segmentation;Vectors;Support vector machines;Kernel;Biomedical imaging;Retina;Segmentation;visual features;geometric algebra;Multilayer Perceptron;Support Vector Machine;microscopy;retinal imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO),
Evaluation of corneal nerves morphology for diabetic peripheral neuropathy assessment,"The evaluation of corneal nerve morphology by optical methods may form the basis of a simple, non-invasive technique for early diagnosis and accurate assessment of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Currently, corneal nerves can be imaged in vivo using corneal confocal microscopy, an expensive technique that is only available at large medical units. Our goal is to develop an optical technique for peripheral neuropathy assessment, through corneal nerves imaging, based on simple, easy to operate and widespread instrumentation. This technique will be built upon automatic algorithms for corneal nerves segmentation and morphometric analysis and an optical confocal module for recording corneal nerves images using a standard slit-lamp, the most commonly used instrument in ophthalmic practice to observe the anterior eye. Here we present the current status and results of this ongoing project.",Diabetes;Optical imaging;Biomedical optical imaging;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Optical distortion;Educational institutions;Diabetic neuropathy;Corneal nerves;Corneal confocal imaging;Automatic image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 IEEE 2nd Portuguese Meeting in Bioengineering (ENBENG),10.1109/ENBENG.2012.6331376
The Use of Inverse Phase Fourier Image to Accommodate Intensity Inhomogeneities in Medical Image Registration,"Medical image registration is generally faced with the confounding effect of spatially dependent intensity variations. This can be the case when images have been acquired using the same imaging modality, for example, in magnetic resonance imaging and also when using various histology and staining processes. We propose the application of an intensity-invariant dense feature extraction method through the use of phase Fourier transforms. The approach allows medical images containing intensity in homogeneities to be aligned and warped as part of a feature-based registration technique. Registration performance was evaluated on mono-modality and multi-modality data, namely magnetic resonance and histology images. Qualitative and quantitative validation was conducted with respect to two established image intensity correction methods.",Measurement;Image registration;Histograms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Feature extraction;Nonhomogeneous media;Inverse phase Fourier image;image registration;intensity inhomogeneity;feature extraction;non-linear registration,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,"2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Modelling and Simulation",10.1109/CIMSim.2012.60
Automated segmentation and analysis of the epidermis area in skin histopathological images,"In the diagnosis of skin melanoma by analyzing histopathological images, the segmentation of the epidermis area is an important step. This paper proposes a computer-aided technique for segmentation and analysis of the epidermis area in the whole slide skin histopathological images. Before the segmentation technique is employed, a monochromatic color channel that provides a good discriminant information between the epidermis and dermis areas is determined. In order to reduce the processing time and perform the analysis efficiently, we employ multi-resolution image analysis in the proposed segmentation technique. At first, a low resolution whole slide image is generated. We then segment the low resolution image using a global threshold method and shape analysis. Based on the segmented epidermis area, the layout of epidermis is determined and the high resolution image tiles of epidermis are generated for further manual or automated analysis. Experimental results on 16 different whole slide skin images show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance, about 92% sensitivity rate, 93% precision and 97% specificity rate.",Epidermis;Tiles;Image segmentation;Dermis;Layout;Transforms,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347204
Mycobacterium tuberculosis recognition with conventional microscopy,"This paper presents a new method for segmentation of tuberculosis bacillus in conventional sputum smear microscopy. The method comprises three main steps. In the first step, a scalar selection are made for characteristics from the following color spaces: RGB, HSI, YCbCr and Lab. The features used for pixel classification in the segmentation step were the components and subtraction of components of these color spaces. In the second step, a feedforward neural network pixel classifier, using selected characteristics as inputs, is applied to segment pixels that belong to bacilli from the background. In third step geometric characteristics, especially the eccentricity, and a new proposed color characteristic, the color ratio, are used to noise filtering. The best sensitivity achieved in bacilli detection was 91.5%.",Microscopy;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Fluorescence;Neural networks;Noise;Sensitivity,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347426
Scale normalization of histopathological images for batch invariant cancer diagnostic models,"Histopathological images acquired from different experimental set-ups often suffer from batch-effects due to color variations and scale variations. In this paper, we develop a novel scale normalization model for histopathological images based on nuclear area distributions. Results indicate that the normalization model closely fits empirical values for two renal tumor datasets. We study the effect of scale normalization on classification of renal tumor images. Scale normalization improves classification performance in most cases. However, performance decreases in a few cases. In order to understand this, we propose two methods to filter extracted image features that are sensitive to image scaling and features that are uncorrelated with scaling factor. Feature filtering improves the classification performance of cases that were initially negatively affected by scale normalization.",Filtering;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Cancer;Tumors;Standards,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346943
Simultaneous Segmentation of Cell and Nucleus in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Images with Focus Gradient,"Schizosaccharomyces pombe shares many genes and proteins with humans and is a good model for chromosome behavior and DNA dynamics, which can be analyzed by visualizing the behavior of fluorescently tagged proteins in vivo [1]. However, performing a genome-wide screen for changes in such proteins requires developing methods that automate analysis of multiple images. The first step requires robust segmentation of the cell and the most distinguishable compartments (the nucleus) from images with varying focus conditions and qualities. We developed a segmentation system that can segment transmitted illumination images with focus gradient and varying contrast, and extract cell and nucleus boundaries. Global and locally adaptive corrections for focus gradient are applied to the image to accurately detect cell membrane and cytoplasm pixels. We use the gradient vector flow snake model [2] to segment individual cells, using a novel edge map based on detected cell membrane. We applied our system to multi-channel images of S. pombe, the whole data set contains about 4000 mutant genotypes each with at least three sets of transmitted illumination (bright field), Rad52-YFP and RPA-CFP images. Our system is able to correctly segment a majority of nuclei and cells in almost all images of sufficient quality, and performance is consistent over a wide variety of focus distance, field brightness, relative contrast and phenotypic characteristics. A quantitative evaluation is also performed using a set of hand produced gold standard segmentations of pombe cells, representing different image acquisition conditions and quality. We evaluated the percentage of cells detected, the accuracy of the final snake contours. The whole set of 60 gold standard images contain a total of 14,926 pombe cells, averaging about 249 cells per image, of which 97.5% were detected by nucleus segmentation and pixel classification of cell interior, and 89.0% were accurately segmented (defined as less than 10% pixel mismatch). Our system generated a total of 16,631 snake contours, of which 88.3% are true positives, the rest being false detections, incorrect merging or partial segmentation. After erroneous cell contours are removed by an automatic contour validation classifier, the remaining cell contours contain 98.3% true positives, this shows that although our system has a modest segmentation accuracy, the final cell contours generated is very reliable overall. For large scale high-throughput applications with huge amounts of data, in order to minimize the need for human intervention, the high reliability and robustness achieved by our system is very valuable. We have also compared with recent methods [3], and our method. In conclusion we have developed a multi-channel cell and nucleus segmentation system for S. pombe cells that uses nucleus protein fluorescence to correct for varying focus and contrast in the transmitted illumination image, combined with active contour segmentation and robust automatic contour validation. This system can be applied to similar light microscopy images where some fluorescence signal within the cell nucleus or cytoplasm is provided, and can in principle be extended to deal with multiple cell types and image modalities.",Image segmentation;Proteins;Educational institutions;Robustness;Lighting;Cities and towns;Hospitals;S. pombe;image segmentation;focus gradient;active contour model,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,"2012 IEEE Second International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, Imaging and Systems Biology",10.1109/HISB.2012.41
Deterministic model for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia classification,"Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and the bone marrow. Manual data analysis is time consuming and not accurate. Attempts to build partial/full automated systems based on segmentation and classification of cells are present in literature, but they are still in prototype stage. Most of the existing automatic systems extract features of the sub-images instead of the complete blood smear. [29]. The main objective of this paper is to a) demonstrate that the classification of peripheral blood smear images containing multiple nuclei can be fully automated, b) to validate the segmented images using hold-out cross validation method. The method has been evaluated using a set of 50 images (with 25 abnormal samples and 25 normal samples) obtained from American Society of Hematology [22]. The computer simulations show that the proposed system robustly segments and classifies Acute Myelogenous Leukemia based on complete microscopic blood images. 93.5% of the cases were correctly classified by the program, suggesting that the method yields good results in terms of classification of leukemia.

Exploration of efficacy of gland morphology and architectural features in prostate cancer gleason grading,"Prostate cancer automatic grading has attracted a lot of attention during the last years [1]. Many research efforts have been fixated on the development of computerized recognition and classification systems to automatically grade Gleason patterns. Automatic computerized Gleason grading methods can be classified into two basic classes: image textural-based class and tissue structural-based (nuclear architecture, gland morphology) class. To the best of our knowledge, tissue structural classification based on three-class classification results including Gleason grade 3, 4 and 5 carcinoma were not reported. The goal of this article is to: (1) develop computerized assessment support systems to automatically grade Gleason patterns 3, 4 and 5 by integrating gland morphology and architectural features; (2) improve classification accuracy especially between intermediate Gleason grades 3 and 4. Computer simulations show an average correct classification accuracy of 97.63%, 96.57% and 87.30% when distinguishing Gleason 3 vs. Gleason 4, Gleason 3 vs. Gleason 5, and Gleason 4 vs. Gleason 5 respectively.

Non-thermal plasma induction of preprogrammed cell death in monocytic leukemia cells,"The need for new and effective mechanisms to induce programmed cellular death (apoptosis) in cancerous cells is of great importance in cancer research. Application of direct as well as indirect exposure of plasma for cancer research is still in the exploratory stage and there remain several unanswered questions. We have developed a portable non-thermal resistive barrier based air plasma source that can be operated in both direct and indirect exposure modes [1]. We are investigating the effects of indirect exposure of non-thermal air plasma on monocytic leukemia cancer cells (THP-1) and deciphering the mechanisms that modulate cellular induction of apoptosis. The phenotypes of interest were cells demonstrating death morphologies of apoptosis or necrosis. This is important since cells undergoing necrosis can initiate an inflamed immune response that can be detrimental to a treated individual. The type of morphological cell death that occurred in THP-1 for various plasma treatment dosages (plasma power, flow and distance) was investigated and the results will be reported. We were able to demonstrate a preference for apoptosis in plasma treated THP-1 cells under particular plasma parameters and dosage levels. The THP-1 cells were identified as apoptotic utilizing a fluorescent dye conjugated with annexin V followed by identification of the cells through fluorescent microscopy and flow-cytometry diagnostics. Further, DNA fragmentation assays, for late detection of apoptosis, correlated with are fluorescence data demonstrating patterns of apoptotic events. However, the data also revealed that higher plasma dosages presented with undesired necrotic morphologies in the THP-1 cells. The presented variabilities in the death morphologies by plasma treated THP-1 cells signify the need for further investigation on the cellular mechanisms induced by the indirect plasma exposure. Along with taking into account other death processes such as autophagy, a catabolic process involving the degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal machinery. The results obtained from this research indicate great potential for the use of our portable non-thermal resistive barrier based indirect plasma treatment method as an inexpensive and less invasive method for treating leukemia and other cancerous lesions.",Plasmas;Cancer;Morphology;Fluorescence;Electromagnetic heating;Heat engines;Educational institutions,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 Abstracts IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science,10.1109/PLASMA.2012.6383688

IVUS-based characterization of atherosclerotic plaques using feature selection and SVM classification,"In this paper we propose an image-based approach for in-vivo assessment of IVUS images. The method discriminates plaque components into four classes: calcium, necrotic core, fibrous and fibro-fatty. We employ the IVUS frames characterized by virtual histology (VH) for tissue labeling. As a result, we avoid the demerits of visual assessments of observers while at the same time the longitudinal resolution of VH is increased. To describe the textural properties of the tissue classes five different features are extracted from IVUS images. The features are computed by using multiple window sizes so that their values are adapted to the varying heterogeneity of the local patterns. In the next stage, we apply an effective feature selection algorithm on the combined feature space of original features, yielding a small subset of discriminating and non-redundant features. The retained features are used for tissue classification via an SVM classifier. The method is validated against the available VH reference data. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of 81%. This result is obtained by a reduced subset comprising 34 features of the appropriate type and scale of extraction.",Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Calcium;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Visualization;Gray-scale;Tissue characterization;IVUS images;virtual histology;feature selection;SVM classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Bioinformatics & Bioengineering (BIBE),10.1109/BIBE.2012.6399755
How Complex Is Cancer Intracellular Signaling Space in FIB-SEM Images?,"How cell regulates its intracellular features to optimize their signaling pathways is still far from understanding. Recent advancement in microscopy imaging of the structure of cell organelles enables biomedical researchers to study cell morphology in great detail to discover the pathogeneses of diseases by information obtained at molecular level. A particular interest is to quantify the complexity of the spatial content of the intracellular space captured by the combination of focused ion beam (FIB) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging systems. Such quantitative measure of the complexity of organelles is expected to be a useful tool for benchmarking biological simulations of cancers and controlling disease-specific drug effects.

Confocal microscopy study on spatial variation of photoluminescence in blue-emitting InGaN/GaN MQWs with different growth parameters,"Scanning confocal microscopy is used to study blue-emitting Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN)/Gallium Nitride (GaN) multi-quantum wells grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition under different growth conditions. Sub-micrometer scale spatial and spectral variation of photoluminescence (PL) has been observed. Spectrum measurement shows the PL peak in bright region is red-shifted comparing with that in dark region, and that the peak intensity of bright region is at least twice as strong as that of dark region. Images show defect luminescence features which are about 500 nm in diameter and have PL peak at around 550 nm. Experiments show that reducing In/Ga ratio, increasing growth pressure and increasing NH3 flow rate can all increase the localization effect and result in the increase of sample average PL intensity. Moreover, average PL intensity increases with the increasing of bandgap difference and PL peak intensity difference between bright and dark regions in PL.",Microscopy;Photonic band gap;Gallium nitride;Luminescence;Light emitting diodes;Optical microscopy;Nonhomogeneous media;InGaN MQWs;MOCVD;scanning confocal microscopy;photoluminescence inhomogeneity,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 Lester Eastman Conference on High Performance Devices (LEC),10.1109/lec.2012.6410971
Implementation of GA-KSOM and ANFIS in the classification of colonic histopathological images,"The WHO reports that colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the world with the majority of people with this type of cancer belonging to those who are 60 years or older.

Microscopic Image Segmentation with Two-Level Enhancement of Feature Discriminability,"Microscopic cellular image segmentation has become one of the most important routine procedures in modern biological applications. The segmentation task is non-trivial, however, mainly due to imaging artifacts causing highly inhomogeneous appearances of cell nuclei and background with large intensity variations within and across images. Such inconsistent appearance profiles would cause feature overlapping between cell nuclei and background pixels and hence lead to misclassifiation. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatic cell nucleus segmentation, focusing on tackling the intensity inhomogeneity issue. A two-level approach is designed to enhance the discriminative power of intensity features, by first a reference-based intensity normalization for reducing the inter-image variations, and then a further localized object discrimination for overcoming the intra-image variations. The proposed method is evaluated on three different sets of 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and encouraging performance improvements over the state-of-the-art results are obtained.",Image segmentation;Nonhomogeneous media;Labeling;Histograms;Gray-scale;Microscopy;Support vector machines,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 International Conference on Digital Image Computing Techniques and Applications (DICTA),10.1109/DICTA.2012.6411682
Application of Weber's Law to Medical Image Registration to Accommodate Intensity Inhomogeneities,"Medical image registration is often confronted by the presence of image intensity inhomogeneity, even when the images are acquired of the same subject using mono-modality techniques.

Noble approach for texture classification of H&E stained histopathological image by Gaussian wavelet,"In this research paper we are introducing a classification approach for determining the texture feature and the subsequent classification of histopathological digital image i.e. applied computer-aided grading of follicular lymphoma (FL) and Neuroblastoma (NB) from whole-slide tissue samples. Basic idea behind this research is to distinguish among nuclei, cytoplasm, extracellular material and red blood cells from H&E stained input image so that doctors (radiologist) can provide better judgment during the prognosis of histopathological image that sometimes wrongly concluded. In this study we proposed a noble algorithm in which we convolve our H&E stained pathological images with 12 different orientation masks, resulting in an output of 12 different representations (corresponding to 12 different orientations) of our H&E stained input image. The information included in the 12 representations coming from the application of Gaussian filter is summarized in twelve images that correspond to each of the orientations used in the filters. We then combine these 12 images into one textured image represented as a 3-dimensional representation of input image. Experimental results on FL & NB demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the gray level based texture analysis.",Decision support systems;Intelligent systems;Computer-aided diagnosis;Gabor mask;Image classification;Texture analysis;Histopathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 12th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA),10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416567

In this paper, an image analysis approach is proposed in order to count the number of cells in an ICC images. For this purpose, morphological filtering is done to clean up noise. Then, nucleuses and antibodies are separated by classifying relevant colors using a Nearest Neighbor classifier. Finally, the adherent cells are segmented by learning a Genetic model and the number of cells has been counted. The experiments have been conducted on a dataset of ICC images which are collected for this research. The results show the high efficiency of the proposed method.",Decision support systems;Hybrid intelligent systems;Image segmentation;Mercury (metals);Microscope Imaging;Immunocytochemical images;Genetic algorithm;Classification;Segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS),10.1109/HIS.2012.6421331
Involuntary diagnosis of intraductal breast images using gaussian mixture model,"Intraductal Carcinoma is a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. During some cases, Intraductal Carcinoma may become persistent cancer. Also spread to other tissues, though it is not known at this time how to predict which lesions will become invasive. Intraductal cancer is the most common type of breast cancer in women. Memory Intraductal includes 3-types of cancer: Usual Ductal Hyperplasia (UDH), Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH), and Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS). So the system of detecting the breast microscopic tissue of UDH, ADH, DCIS is proposed. The current standard of care is to perform percutaneous needle biopsies for diagnosis of palpable and image-detected breast abnormalities. UDH is considered benign and patients diagnosed UDH undergo routine follow-up, whereas ADH and DCIS are considered actionable and patients diagnosed with these two subtypes get additional surgical procedures. The systems classify the tissue based on the quantitative feature derived from the images. The statistical features are obtained. The approach makes use of preprocessing, Cell region segmentation, Individual cell segmentation, Feature extraction technique for the detection of cancer.",Breast;Image segmentation;Lesions;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Standards;Cancer;Intraductal Carcinoma;percutaneous;Cell Segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 International Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing (MVIP),10.1109/MVIP.2012.6428773
Automated classification of local patches in colon histopathology,"An automated histology analysis is proposed for classification of local image patches of colon histopathology images into four principle classes: normal, cancer, adenomatous and inflamed classes. Shape features based on stroma, lumen and imperfectly segmented nuclei are combined with texture features for classification. The classification is analyzed under the three scenarios: normal vs. abnormal, cancer vs. non-cancer and four-class classification on a labeled dataset consisting of 2000 patches per class which were collected from 55 different slices. The proposed method achieves 79.28% mean accuracy between normal and abnormal; 87.67% accuracy between cancer and non-cancer and 75.15% between the four classes with equal class priories.",Cancer;Feature extraction;Colon;Accuracy;Shape;Image segmentation;Pattern recognition,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012),
Learning-based mitotic cell detection in histopathological images,"Breast cancer grading of histological tissue samples by visual inspection is the standard clinical practice for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer development. An important parameter for tumor prognosis is the number of mitotic cells present in histologically stained breast cancer tissue sections. We propose a hierarchical learning workflow for automated mitosis detection in breast cancer. From an initial training set a pixel-wise classifier is learned to segment candidate cells, which are then classified into mitotic and non-mitotic cells using object shape and texture features. Our workflow banks on two open source biomedical image analysis software: “ilastik” and “CellCognition” which provide a user user friendly interface to powerful learning algorithms, with the potential of making the pathologist work an easier task. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 35 high-resolution histopathological images from 5 different specimen (provided by International Conference for Pattern Recognition 2012 contest on Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histological Images). Based on the candidate segmentation our approach achieves an area-under Precision-Recall-curve of 70% on an annotated dataset, with good localization accuracy, little parameter tuning and small user effort.

Our supervised classification method aims at recognizing patterns of unlabeled cells based on an annotated dataset. First, the cell images need to be indexed by encoding them in a feature space. For this purpose, we propose tailored bio-inspired features relying on the distribution of contrast information. Then, a supervised learning algorithm is proposed for classifying the cells. We carried out experiments on cellular images related to the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, testing our classification method on the HEp-2 Cells dataset of Foggia et al (CBMS 2010). Results show classification precision larger than 96% on average, thus confirming promising application of our approach to the challenging application of cellular image classification for computer-aided diagnosis.",Support vector machines;Visualization;Training;Image segmentation;Standards;Retina;Educational institutions,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012),
Texture and shape in fluorescence pattern identification for auto-immune disease diagnosis,"Automation of HEp-2 cell pattern classification would drastically improve the accuracy and throughput of diagnostic services for many auto-immune diseases, but it has proven difficult to reach a sufficient level of precision. Correct diagnosis relies on a subtle assessment of texture type in microscopic images of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), which so far has eluded reliable replication through automated measurements. We introduce a combination of spectral analysis and multi-scale digital filtering to extract the most discriminative variables from the cell images. We also apply multistage classification techniques to make optimal use of the limited labelled data set. Overall error rate of 1.6% is achieved in recognition of 6 different cell patterns, which drops to 0.5% if only positive samples are considered.",Vectors;Error analysis;Shape;Diseases;Noise;Pattern recognition;Accuracy,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012),
Adaptive active-mask image segmentation for quantitative characterization of mitochondrial morphology,"We propose an automated algorithm for segmentation of mitochondria from widefield fluorescence microscopy images for quantitative morphology characterization. Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that are essential to cells of higher living organisms. Reliable and precise quantitative characterization of their shape is crucial to understanding related physiology and disease mechanisms. Building upon the active-mask framework developed for segmentation of confocal fluorescence microscope images, we propose a new adaptive region-based distributing function to effectively address the problem of halo artifacts that are common in widefield fluorescence images. Such artifacts prevent the segmentation of weak features of mitochondria using existing algorithms. We compare the algorithm to the original active-mask algorithm as well as the geodesic active contour algorithm based on hand-segmented ground truth, and find that it performs significantly better both qualitatively and quantitatively.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image resolution;Algorithm design and analysis;Shape;Biomedical imaging;Active contours;segmentation;active masks;mitochondria,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467289
Automated colitis detection from endoscopic biopsies as a tissue screening tool in diagnostic pathology,"We present a method for identifying colitis in colon biopsies as an extension of our framework for the automated identification of tissues in histology images. Histology is a critical tool in both clinical and research applications, yet even mundane histological analysis, such as the screening of colon biopsies, must be carried out by highly-trained pathologists at a high cost per hour, indicating a niche for potential automation. To this end, we build upon our previous work by extending the histopathology vocabulary (a set of features based on visual cues used by pathologists) with new features driven by the colitis application. We use the multiple-instance learning framework to allow our pixel-level classifier to learn from image-level training labels. The new system achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art biological image classifiers with fewer and more intuitive features.",Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Colon;Training;Diseases;Vocabulary;histology;colitis;image classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467483

A tool for automatic dendritic spine detection and analysis. Part I: Dendritic spine detection using multi-level region-based segmentation,"We propose an image processing pipeline for dendritic spine detection in two-photon fluorescence microscopy images. Spines of interest to neuroscientists often contain high intensity regions with respect to their surroundings. We find such maxima regions using morphological image reconstruction. These regions facilitate a multi-level segmentation algorithm to detect spines. First, watershed algorithm is applied to extract initial rough regions of spines. Then, these results are further refined using a graph-theoretic region-growing algorithm which incorporates segmentation on a sparse representation of image data and hierarchical clustering as a post-processing step. We compare our final results to segmentation results of the domain expert. Our pipeline produces promising segmentation results with practical run times for monitoring streaming data.",Image segmentation;Image reconstruction;Filtering;Biomedical imaging;Neural image processing;fluorescence microscopy;dendritic spines;image segmentation;clustering,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,"2012 3rd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)",10.1109/IPTA.2012.6469558
Contour-based surface modeling and analysis of microtomographic trabecular bone images,"Bone quality is an important factor of bone strength. Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by longitudinal changes in 3-D trabecular bone structure, such as decreased trabecular thickness. With the purpose of identifying parameters indicate the quality of bone micro-architecture, a strategy are developed, using High Resolution Micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) images. The main idea is the use of the morphological operator and the watershed algorithm in order to separate at each slice the bone phase from the marrow phase. As well, we make use of basic morphological transforms for eliminating artifacts and aliasing from obtained contours. Three dimensional reconstructions of samples were created by stacking all the 2D obtained boundary top of each other. The zero iso-surface embedded in the computed volume in order to localize vertices from successive slices. A mesh that approximates the zero isosurface is then extracted from the resulting volume.

Coke microscopic image segmentation based on iterative grid clustering,"Separting the coke microstructures from coke microscopic image is a crucial task for automatic recognition by using digital image analysis technology. This paper aims at improving the segmentation accuracy of coke microscopic image by integrating iterative grid clustering procedure into image segmentation algorithm. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of three stages: feature extraction, grid clustring and iterative optimization. At the first step, color features reflecting the difference of coke microstructures are extracted for coke microscopic image segmentation. At the second step, I1I2I3 color space is divided into grid cells through grid division and coke microscopic image is segmented initially by mean shift vectors. Finally, iterative optimization algorithm is adopted for further image segmentation until coke microscopic image is segmented into several parts. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for separating the coke microstructures, and offers a reliable foundation for automatic identification.",Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Microstructure;Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Microscopy;Vectors;image segmentation;feature extraction;grid clustering;iterative optimization,INPROCEEDINGS,2012,2012 19th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP),
A Fast Technique for White Blood Cells Nuclei Automatic Segmentation Based on Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization,"Blood testing is one of the most important clinical examinations. Counting different blood cells is a significant process in a clinical laboratory. Manual microscopic evaluation is compulsory in case there is suspicious abnormality in the blood sample. Yet, the manual inspection is time-consuming and requires adequate technical knowledge. Therefore, automatic medical diagnosis systems are necessary to help physicians to diagnose diseases in a fast and nonetheless competent way. Cell automatic classification has wider interest especially for clinics and laboratories. Segmentation is the most important step for automatic classification success. This paper represents an efficient technique for automatic blood cell nuclei segmentation. This technique is relying on enhancing the color of the target object, nucleus, and filtering the image. Small objects are eliminated employing morphological operations. A set of 365 blood images was used to quantitatively evaluate this segmentation technique. Assessment of the proposed technique on the blood image set gives 85.4% accuracy. In comparison to other published technique that was implemented and executed on the same dataset, the proposed segmentation technique performance was found to be superior. A differential segmentation performance evaluation was performed on the five normal white blood cell types to compare isolated performance. Eosin Phil was found to have the highest segmentation accuracy with 90.1%. Lymphocyte and Basophil have the lowest accuracy with 78.3% and 78.6% respectively.

Discrete Mereotopology for Spatial Reasoning in Automated Histological Image Analysis,"Discrete mereotopology (DM) is a first-order spatial logic that fuses together mereology (the theory of parthood relations) and topology to model discrete space. We show how a set of quasitopological functions defined within DM can be mapped to specific operators defined in mathematical morphology (MM) and easily implemented in scientific image processing programs. These functions provide the means to model topological properties of individual regions and spatial relations between them such as contact, overlap, and the relation of part to whole. DM not only extends the expressive power of image processing applications where mathematical morphology is used, but by functioning as a logic it also supplies the formal basis with which to prove the correctness of implemented algorithms as well as providing the computational basis to mechanically reason about segmented digital images using automated reasoning programs. In particular, we show how DM can supply a model-based and algorithmic context to the otherwise blind pixel-based image processing routines still dominating conventional imaging approaches.

Characterization and Modeling of the Peripheral Cardiac Conduction System,"The development of biophysical models of the heart has the potential to get insights in the patho-physiology of the heart, which requires to accurately modeling anatomy and function. The electrical activation sequence of the ventricles depends strongly on the cardiac conduction system (CCS). Its morphology and function cannot be observed in vivo, and therefore data available come from histological studies. We present a review on data available of the peripheral CCS including new experiments. In order to build a realistic model of the CCS we designed a procedure to extract morphological characteristics of the CCS from stained calf tissue samples. A CCS model personalized with our measurements has been built using L-systems. The effect of key unknown parameters of the model in the electrical activation of the left ventricle has been analyzed. The CCS models generated share the main characteristics of observed stained Purkinje networks. The timing of the simulated electrical activation sequences were in the physiological range for CCS models that included enough density of PMJs.

A Collaborative Biomedical Image-Mining Framework: Application on the Image Analysis of Microscopic Kidney Biopsies,"The analysis and characterization of biomedical image data is a complex procedure involving several processing phases, such as data acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proper combination and parameterization of the utilized methods are heavily relying on the given image dataset and experiment type. They may thus necessitate advanced image processing and classification knowledge and skills from the side of the biomedical expert. In this study, an application, exploiting web services and applying ontological modeling, is presented, to enable the intelligent creation of image-mining workflows.

Histology Image Retrieval in Optimized Multifeature Spaces,"Content-based histology image retrieval systems have shown great potential in supporting decision making in clinical activities, teaching, and biological research. In content-based image retrieval, feature combination plays a key role. It aims at enhancing the descriptive power of visual features corresponding to semantically meaningful queries. It is particularly valuable in histology image analysis where intelligent mechanisms are needed for interpreting varying tissue composition and architecture into histological concepts. This paper presents an approach to automatically combine heterogeneous visual features for histology image retrieval. The aim is to obtain the most representative fusion model for a particular keyword that is associated with multiple query images. The core of this approach is a multiobjective learning method, which aims to understand an optimal visual-semantic matching function by jointly considering the different preferences of the group of query images. The task is posed as an optimization problem, and a multiobjective optimization strategy is employed in order to handle potential contradictions in the query images associated with the same keyword. Experiments were performed on two different collections of histology images. The results show that it is possible to improve a system for content-based histology image retrieval by using an appropriately defined multifeature fusion model, which takes careful consideration of the structure and distribution of visual features.",Visualization;Image retrieval;Feature extraction;Semantics;Medical diagnostic imaging;Histograms;Content-based image retrieval (CBIR);feature fusion;histology image retrieval;multiobjective optimization,ARTICLE,2013,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/TITB.2012.2227270
Quantifying the Interfibrillar Spacing and Fibrillar Orientation of the Aortic Extracellular Matrix Using Histology Image Processing: Toward Multiscale Modeling,"An essential part of understanding tissue microstructural mechanics is to establish quantitative measures of the morphological changes. Given the complex, highly localized, and interactive architecture of the extracellular matrix, developing techniques to reproducibly quantify the induced microstructural changes has been found to be challenging. In this paper, a new method for quantifying the changes in the fibrillar organization is developed using histology images. A combinatorial frequency–spatial image processing approach was developed based on the Fourier and Hough transformations of histology images to measure interfibrillar spacing and fibrillar orientation, respectively. The method was separately applied to the inner and outer wall thickness of native- and elastin-isolated aortic tissues under different loading states. Results from both methods were interpreted in a complementary manner to obtain a more complete understanding of morphological changes due to tissue deformations at the microscale. The observations were consistent in quantifying the observed morphological changes during tissue deformations and in explaining such changes in terms of tissue-scale phenomena. The findings of this study could pave the way for more rigorous modeling of structure–property relationships in soft tissues, with implications extendable to cardiovascular constitutive modeling and tissue engineering.",Image segmentation;Transforms;Microstructure;Imaging;Biomedical measurements;Biological tissues;Fourier transform;Hough transform;microstructural quantification;vascular biomechanics,ARTICLE,2013,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2012.2229708
Invariant Delineation of Nuclear Architecture in Glioblastoma Multiforme for Clinical and Molecular Association,"Automated analysis of whole mount tissue sections can provide insights into tumor subtypes and the underlying molecular basis of neoplasm. However, since tumor sections are collected from different laboratories, inherent technical and biological variations impede analysis for very large datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our objective is to characterize tumor histopathology, through the delineation of the nuclear regions, from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections. Such a representation can then be mined for intrinsic subtypes across a large dataset for prediction and molecular association. Furthermore, nuclear segmentation is formulated within a multi-reference graph framework with geodesic constraints, which enables computation of multidimensional representations, on a cell-by-cell basis, for functional enrichment and bioinformatics analysis. Here, we present a novel method, multi-reference graph cut (MRGC), for nuclear segmentation that overcomes technical variations associated with sample preparation by incorporating prior knowledge from manually annotated reference images and local image features. The proposed approach has been validated on manually annotated samples and then applied to a dataset of 377 Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) whole slide images from 146 patients. For the GBM cohort, multidimensional representation of the nuclear features and their organization have identified 1) statistically significant subtypes based on several morphometric indexes, 2) whether each subtype can be predictive or not, and 3) that the molecular correlates of predictive subtypes are consistent with the literature. Data and intermediaries for a number of tumor types (GBM, low grade glial, and kidney renal clear carcinoma) are available at: http://tcga.lbl.gov for correlation with TCGA molecular data.

Classification and Staging of Chronic Liver Disease From Multimodal Data,"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is most of the time an asymptomatic, progressive, and ultimately potentially fatal disease. In this study, an automatic hierarchical procedure to stage CLD using ultrasound images, laboratory tests, and clinical records are described. The first stage of the proposed method, called clinical based classifier (CBC), discriminates healthy from pathologic conditions. When nonhealthy conditions are detected, the method refines the results in three exclusive pathologies in a hierarchical basis: 1) chronic hepatitis; 2) compensated cirrhosis; and 3) decompensated cirrhosis. The features used as well as the classifiers (Bayes, Parzen, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor) are optimally selected for each stage. A large multimodal feature database was specifically built for this study containing 30 chronic hepatitis cases, 34 compensated cirrhosis cases, and 36 decompensated cirrhosis cases, all validated after histopathologic analysis by liver biopsy. The CBC classification scheme outperformed the nonhierachical one against all scheme, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.67% for the normal detector, 87.45% for the chronic hepatitis detector, and 95.71% for the cirrhosis detector.",Liver;Laboratories;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Biopsy;Indexes;Medical diagnostic imaging;Chronic liver disease (CLD);cirrhosis;classification;ultrasound-based textural features,ARTICLE,2013,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2012.2235438
A Self-Focusing Acoustic Transducer That Exploits Cytoskeletal Differences for Selective Cytolysis of Cancer Cells,"Biophysical effects of ultrasonic energy in tissue include changes induced by heat, cavitation, and body force (radiation energy). Conventional acoustic devices generate low-frequency (1-4 MHz) high-intensity acoustic waves (> 103 W/cm2), which cause tissue destruction primarily through thermal or cavitation effects. However, these effects may be difficult to precisely control and not specific for cancerous cells over normal tissue. Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and therapeutic potential of high-frequency (18-MHz) acoustic irradiation with a self-focusing acoustic transducer (SFAT). A surface micromachining technique was used on a piezoelectric substrate to produce a SFAT device capable of focusing acoustic energy within an area of 100 μm in diameter at the 800-μm focal length. As we sought to minimize potentially nonspecific heat or cavitation effects by acoustic irradiation, operational parameters were chosen to study bioeffects of the device in the absence of tissue heating or biological effects due to cavitation. By varying the acoustic energy, we identified an acoustic intensity threshold (AIT) of 0.15 W/cm2 at 17.3 MHz, sufficient to cause this cytolysis effect in human prostate cancer cells 22RV1 without heat or cavitation. Next, we compared the AIT in various cell lines representative of benign and malignant prostate, breast, and skin cells and observed lower AITs in cancer cells over nonmalignant variants. As decreased stiffness (increased compliance) is a biomechanical characteristic, which differs between malignant and nonmalignant cell lines, we hypothesized that a less organized actin cytoskeletal pattern, which is known to be associated with decreased cell stiffness, would correlate with changes in the AIT. Actin staining of cytoskeletal structures confirmed an association between a pattern of diffuse and less organized actin filaments with decreased AIT. Moreover, the same trend of decreased actin organization and decreased AIT was observed following treatments that changed actin patterns in the MCF-10A breast epithelial cell line. These results suggest that biomechanical properties make malignant cells specifically sensitive to cytolysis caused by this form of acoustic energy. In summary, we describe a miniaturized acoustic transducer capable of producing a heatless and cavitation-free, cancer-specific focused cytolysis by direct body force (radiation pressure) effects alone. Ultimately, this device may lead to a miniaturized cancer-treatment system that can be used to focally and specifically ablate cancerous tissue with microscopic precision.",Cells (biology);Cancer;Radiation effects;Transducers;Heating;Acoustic waves;Cell lysis;cytoskeleton alteration;high-frequency focused ultrasound;microelectromechanical systems (MEMS);self-focusing acoustic transducer (SFAT),ARTICLE,2013,Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems,10.1109/JMEMS.2012.2229696
Multi-Field-of-View Framework for Distinguishing Tumor Grade in ER+ Breast Cancer From Entire Histopathology Slides,"Modified Bloom-Richardson (mBR) grading is known to have prognostic value in breast cancer (BCa), yet its use in clinical practice has been limited by intra- and interobserver variability. The development of a computerized system to distinguish mBR grade from entire estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BCa histopathology slides will help clinicians identify grading discrepancies and improve overall confidence in the diagnostic result. In this paper, we isolate salient image features characterizing tumor morphology and texture to differentiate entire hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained histopathology slides based on mBR grade. The features are used in conjunction with a novel multifield-of-view (multi-FOV) classifier-a whole-slide classifier that extracts features from a multitude of FOVs of varying sizes-to identify important image features at different FOV sizes. Image features utilized include those related to the spatial arrangement of cancer nuclei (i.e., nuclear architecture) and the textural patterns within nuclei (i.e., nuclear texture). Using slides from 126 ER+ patients (46 low, 60 intermediate, and 20 high mBR grade), our grading system was able to distinguish low versus high, low versus intermediate, and intermediate versus high grade patients with area under curve values of 0.93, 0.72, and 0.74, respectively. Our results suggest that the multi-FOV classifier is able to 1) successfully discriminate low, medium, and high mBR grade and 2) identify specific image features at different FOV sizes that are important for distinguishing mBR grade in Hand E stained ER+ BCa histology slides.",Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Cancer;Tumors;Erbium;Educational institutions;Image edge detection;Breast cancer (BCa);digital pathology;image analysis;modified Bloom–Richardson (mBR) grade;multi-field-of-view (multi-FOV);nuclear architecture;nuclear texture,ARTICLE,2013,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2013.2245129
EM Estimation of Nanostructure Interactions With Incomplete Feature Measurement and Its Tailored Space Filling Designs,"Automatic assessment of nanostructure quality is essential for scale-up nanomanufacturing. In our previous work, we have developed a method to quantify nanostructure growth quality and detect structural defects through interaction analysis. However, because the method builds on complete feature measurement, its direct application to nanomanufacturing systems is severely constrained by nanostructure metrology. For current inspection techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), the major difficulties of measuring nanostructures lie in two aspects: (i) taking and calibrating images for seamless coverage and (ii) extracting and matching feature information from the images. In this paper, we develop a tailored sampling strategy to relax the metrology constraint. It not only explores the growth region with greatly reduced metrology efforts but maintains desired sampling resolution. In addition, we customize Expectation-Maximization algorithm to optimize interaction estimation with corresponding “incomplete” measurement. Our developed approach enables nanostructure characterization within manufacturing relevant time spans and thus provides a supporting tool for nanomanufacturing. Note to Practitioners-Automatic assessment of nanostructure quality is essential for scale-up nanomanufacturing, but current characterization of nanostructures based on SEM or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is labor and computation intensive.

Automated Segmentation of the Melanocytes in Skin Histopathological Images,"In the diagnosis of skin melanoma by analyzing histopathological images, the detection of the melanocytes in the epidermis area is an important step. However, the detection of melanocytes in the epidermis area is difficult because other keratinocytes that are very similar to the melanocytes are also present. This paper proposes a novel computer-aided technique for segmentation of the melanocytes in the skin histopathological images. In order to reduce the local intensity variant, a mean-shift algorithm is applied for the initial segmentation of the image. A local region recursive segmentation algorithm is then proposed to filter out the candidate nuclei regions based on the domain prior knowledge. To distinguish the melanocytes from other keratinocytes in the epidermis area, a novel descriptor, named local double ellipse descriptor (LDED), is proposed to measure the local features of the candidate regions. The LDED uses two parameters: region ellipticity and local pattern characteristics to distinguish the melanocytes from the candidate nuclei regions. Experimental results on 28 different histopathological images of skin tissue with different zooming factors show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance.",Image segmentation;Epidermis;Kernel;Image color analysis;Cancer;Shape;Histopathological image analysis;image segmentation;local descriptor;object detection;pattern recognition,ARTICLE,2013,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/TITB.2012.2199595

This allows evaluating the grade of some metabolic disorder, comparing normal values with pathological ones. Generally, quantifications are carried out by simple visual inspection presenting big inter-and intra-user differences.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy assessment through corneal nerve morphometry,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes. It affects 50% of the patients after 25 years of disease. Its early diagnosis and accurate assessment are important to define the higher risk patients. A non-invasive technique for its assessment was developed. The technique is based on morphometric parameters of corneal nerves, obtained by analysis of corneal confocal microscopy images of the sub-basal nerve plexus. We examined 12 type-2 diabetic patients (average age: 58±10 years) and 8 healthy controls (54±7 years). We found differences statistically significant for nerve length, density, width and branching parameters, when we compare individuals with and without neuropathy. The corneal sub-basal nerve plexus morphology has the potential for identifying the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and evaluating its severity.",Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Biomedical measurement;Context;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE 3rd Portuguese Meeting in Bioengineering (ENBENG),10.1109/ENBENG.2013.6518436
Hardware Implementation of Active Contour Algorithm for Fast Cancer Cells Detection,"A critical process in real-time optical microscopy applications, such as cancer cells detection, is the determination of a cells position in the histopathological image. Aiming at low-cost and efficiency, a proof-of-concept study was done to distinguish between normal and abnormal cells based on optical microscopy at the LICM laboratory. A snake/active contour method was developed in which several curves move within images to find normal/abnormal cell boundaries. Abnormal cell identification typically takes more than one hour, however an implementation on FPGA technology solves this problem. A novel embedded architecture of the snake method was developed for an efficient and fast computation of active contour used in high throughput image analysis applications, where time performance is critical. This architecture allows for a scalable and a totally embedded processing on FPGA of a large number of images. The architecture of the snake method was able to detect objects from images which have irregular shapes, such as carcinoma cell types. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, the architecture was implemented on Xilinx ISE 12.3-FPGA technology using VHDL structural description. It shows the possibility of using the snake method implementation on FPGA technology to detect abnormal cells in real time.",Active contours;Field programmable gate arrays;Computer architecture;Mathematical model;Cancer;Optical imaging;Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 29th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference,10.1109/SBEC.2013.73
Learning Context Cues for Synapse Segmentation,"We present a new approach for the automated segmentation of synapses in image stacks acquired by electron microscopy (EM) that relies on image features specifically designed to take spatial context into account. These features are used to train a classifier that can effectively learn cues such as the presence of a nearby post-synaptic region. As a result, our algorithm successfully distinguishes synapses from the numerous other organelles that appear within an EM volume, including those whose local textural properties are relatively similar. Furthermore, as a by-product of the segmentation, our method flawlessly determines synaptic orientation, a crucial element in the interpretation of brain circuits. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets, compare it against the state-of-the-art in synapse segmentation and demonstrate our ability to reliably collect shape, density, and orientation statistics over hundreds of synapses.",Context;Image segmentation;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Manuals;Microscopy;Tensile stress;AdaBoost;connectomics;electron microscopy;pose-indexing;synapse segmentation,ARTICLE,2013,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2013.2267747

In the first step features are extracted using Haralick texture descriptor in the La*b* color space for pre-segmentation of histopathological images. Some training sets with different number of samples are obtained by cellular and extra-cellular structures in images and classifier models are formed by these training sets using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest methods.

A watershed and active contours based method for dendritic spine segmentation in 2-photon microscopy images,"Analysing morphological and volumetric properties of dendritic spines from 2-photon microscopy images has been of interest to neuroscientists in recent years. Developing robust and reliable tools for automatic analysis depends on the segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation algorithm for dendritic spine segmentation based on watershed and active contour methods. First, our proposed method coarsely segments the dendritic spine area using the watershed algorithm. Then, these results are further refined using a region-based active contour approach. We compare our results and the results of existing methods in the literature to manual delineations of a domain expert.

Detection of tuberculosis bacteria with microscopic image analysis,"The proposal of World Health Organization (WHO) for a basic and preliminary technique of diagnosing tuberculosis disease is based upon visual examination in microscopic image sequences of sputum samples stained with ZN-stain procedure. This examination which requires spending considerable time for specialists causes a significant increase in laboratorians' workload, misdiagnosis and loss of time. Therefore, in this paper a new method for automatic detection of TB bacteria from microscopic images is proposed. RGB color distribution of bacterial regions which is sampled in training period is performed to learning by using multi dimensional Gaussian distribution function. The Mahalanobis distances of training samples in multi dimensional color space are taking into account and noisy data in distribution space is removed from training set.

A novel approach for colon biopsy image segmentation,"Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Traditionally, colon cancer is diagnosed using microscopic analysis of colon biopsy images. However, computer based diagnosis involves acquiring a biopsy image, segmenting the image into constituent regions, extracting features, and based on features identifying cancerous and non-cancerous regions. Image segmentation that is the core process in overall diagnosis is extremely challenging due to similar color distribution in various biological regions of histopathological images. Problem gets more complicated for homogenous images or images acquired under different conditions, particularly change in magnification factor. Several segmentation schemes, proposed for colon images, do not address these problems. In this research study, we propose an un-supervised colon biopsy image segmentation scheme that incorporates background knowledge of benign and malignant tissue organization. The scheme detects elliptical epithelial cells in four angular directions of 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, and divides elliptic constituents into distinct `primitives'. It further makes use of the distribution as well as spatial relations of these `primitives' to define a homogeneity measure for identifying regions. Contrary to previous ones, the proposed scheme removes dependency on change in magnification and image type. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been employed to optimize several system parameters such as semi-major and semi-minor axis of ellipse, component area threshold to remove smaller components, and merge factor to merge two adjacent and similar regions. Algorithm has been tested on 100 colon biopsy images and improved segmentation accuracy has been observed when compared with segmentation results obtained using circular primitive based techniques.",Image segmentation;Colon;Biopsy;Cancer;Microscopy;Genetic algorithms;Accuracy;Colon cancer;Segmentation;Elliptic primitives;Colon biopsy,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering,10.1109/ICCME.2013.6548226
Computer-aided software for early diagnosis of eerythemato-squamous diseases,"Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment remain a necessary challenge. Dermatologic emergencies have insufficient attention by the general population and by physicians from other specialties. The differential diagnosis of erythematosquamous diseases is a real problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling with very little differences. These diseases are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. In this study, computer-aided software was developed to diagnosis dermatological diseases by using artificial neural networks. The supervised backpropagation algorithm is used to train the networks. Classification of the average value of sensitivity (or recognition percentage) was found as 98% for six erythemato-squamous diseases.",Diseases;Artificial neural networks;Software;Accuracy;Expert systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Early diagnosis;Dermatology diseases;Software;Artificial neural networks,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE XXXIII International Scientific Conference Electronics and Nanotechnology (ELNANO),10.1109/ELNANO.2013.6552035
Co-occurring gland tensors in localized cluster graphs: Quantitative histomorphometry for predicting biochemical recurrence for intermediate grade prostate cancer,"Quantitative histomorphometry (QH), computational tools to analyze digitized tissue histology, has become increasingly important for aiding pathologists in assessing cancer severity. In this study, we introduce a novel set of QH features utilizing co-occurring gland tensors (CGT) in localized cluster graphs to quantitatively evaluate prostate cancer (CaP) histology. CGTs offer three main advantages over previous QH features: 1) gland tensors represent a novel measurement that has been anecdotally described as one of interest, but never quantitatively modeled, 2) CGTs extract measurements based on local rather than global glandular networks, constructed using cluster graphs, and 3) second order statistical features (energy, homogeneity, energy, and correlation) obtained from a co-occurrence matrix capture the spatial interactions of gland tensors in the image. We extract 4 CGT features from 56 regions across 40 intermediate grade CaP patients and evaluated the ability of CGT features to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) within 5 years of radical prostatectomy. Intermediate Gleason score 7 cancers represent the predictive borderline for BCR cases, where 50% of cases develop BCR. We found that CGT features outperformed 5 different sets of QH features, previously shown to be effective in CaP grading, when evaluated via a Random Forest classifier (66% accuracy for CGT features versus 55% for the next closest QH feature set), all comparisons being statistically significant.",Glands;Tensile stress;Feature extraction;Prostate cancer;Educational institutions;Correlation,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556425
Cell segmentation and classification via unsupervised shape ranking,"As histology patterns vary depending on different tissue types, it is typically necessary to adapt and optimize segmentation algorithms to these tissue type-specific applications. Here we present an unsupervised method that utilizes cell shape cues to achieve this task-specific optimization by introducing a shape ranking function. The proposed algorithm is part of our Layers™ toolkit for image and data analysis for multiplexed immunohistopathology images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of methodology is proposed for segmentation and ranking in cell tissue samples. Our new cell ranking scheme takes into account both shape and scale information and provides information about the quality of the segmentation. First, we introduce cell-shape descriptor that can effectively discriminate the cell-type's morphology. Secondly, we formulate a hierarchical-segmentation as a dynamic optimization problem, where cells are subdivided if they improve a segmentation quality criteria. Third, we propose a numerically efficient algorithm to solve this dynamic optimization problem. Our approach is generic, since we don't assume any particular cell morphology and can be applied to different segmentation problems. We show results in segmenting and ranking thousands of cells from multiplexing images and we compare our method with well established segmentation techniques, obtaining very encouraging results.",Shape;Image segmentation;Partitioning algorithms;Shape measurement;Optimization;Data models;Histograms,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556498
Classification of tumor histopathology via sparse feature learning,"Our goal is to decompose whole slide images (WSI) of histology sections into distinct patches (e.g., viable tumor, necrosis) so that statistics of distinct histopathology can be linked with the outcome. Such an analysis requires a large cohort of histology sections that may originate from different laboratories, which may not use the same protocol in sample preparation. We have evaluated a method based on a variation of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that learns intrinsic features of the image signature in an unsupervised fashion. Computed code, from the learned representation, is then utilized to classify patches from acurated library of images. The system has been evaluated against a dataset of small image blocks of 1k-by-1k that have been extracted from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and clear cell kidney carcinoma (KIRC) from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) archive. The learned model is then projected on each whole slide image (e.g., of size 20k-by-20k pixels or larger) for characterizing and visualizing tumor architecture. In the case of GBM, each WSI is decomposed into necrotic, transition into necrosis, and viable. In the case of the KIRC, each WSI is decomposed into tumor types, stroma, normal, and others.

Combining phase contrast and immunofluorescence images using geometric hashing,"The analysis of in vitro cultured stem cells is a challenging task. One particularly important question pertains the relationship between proliferation and differentiation. Here, we introduce an image-based method to combine information about cellular genealogies with an analysis of the protein expression of cells in a culture dish. The method uses a time-series of microscopical images and a immunofluorescence (IF) image. The time-series can be used to obtain the genealogical nexus, while the IF-image displays the expression of a chosen marker-protein within each cell. The task was then to find an algorithm, which automatically maps the last image of the time-series onto the immunofluorescence image. Our solution to this problem is to use a cell detection algorithm in the time-lapse images and a cell nuclei detection in the IF-images to determine the position of the cells. Then, the cell positions are used to match the images with a geometric hashing based method. The robustness of the implemented algorithm is demonstrated using microscopical reference data. In addition, the algorithm was used to estimate the displacement of the cell nuclei (IF image) relatively to the cell shape position, i.e. the centroids in the time-lapse data.",Microscopy;Shape;In vitro;Proteins;Biomedical imaging;Immune system;Educational institutions;Cell Tracking;Time-Lapse Microscopy;Image Segmentation;Geometric Hashing,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556622

Quantitation of cancer regions in microscopic low resolution histopathological colon tissue images to predict patient survival,"Despite the generally excellent outcomes associated with early stage colon cancer treatment, a significant number of patients still develop recurrence and ultimately die from their disease. The standard tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system cannot predict which patient will recur and will need additional therapy. This study aims to provide clinicians with a new computational tool based on quantitative analyses of histopathological images and a systems approach to accurately predict disease recurrence. We developed a set of advanced imaging algorithms including unsupervised dissection to automatically segment images into major histopathological components and to extract a broad spectrum of quantitative measurements from these components. Considering the complex interplay among various factors, a novel non-parametric random survival forest methodology was used to identify factors that most accurately predict the survival of colon cancer patients. Relative area and Haralick's contrast features of the tumor necrosis region have been identified as the most statistically significant predictors of survival for early stage colon cancer patients.",Cancer;Colon;Image segmentation;Tumors;Image analysis;White spaces;Imaging;image analysis;cancer;segmentation;cancer clustering;cancer localization;tissue quantitation;patient survival prediction,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556678

Automatic target segmentation based on texture for microscopic images of Chinese herbal powders,"The identification of Chinese herbal powders is usually based on physical or chemical detection, but that is far from enough to identity dozens of herbal species. Microscopic images of these powders contain variety of information, and important evidence for identification. These images usually contain variety of substance, and most of them are noises, which makes the target segmentation become a difficult job. An effective automatic target segmentation algorithm based on texture is proposed in this paper. Our method consists of two steps: “Preliminary Segmentation” and “Further Segmentation”. Firstly, feature vector of texture is extracted and clustered into two groups: background and foreground; secondly, taking the continuity of edge and the locality of target into consideration, energy equations are established, and Maximum flow-Minimum cut Algorithm is applied to solve them.

Multi-Class Multi-Scale Series Contextual Model for Image Segmentation,"Contextual information has been widely used as a rich source of information to segment multiple objects in an image. A contextual model uses the relationships between the objects in a scene to facilitate object detection and segmentation. Using contextual information from different objects in an effective way for object segmentation, however, remains a difficult problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called multiclass multiscale (MCMS) series contextual model, which uses contextual information from multiple objects and at different scales for learning discriminative models in a supervised setting. The MCMS model incorporates cross-object and inter-object information into one probabilistic framework and thus is able to capture geometrical relationships and dependencies among multiple objects in addition to local information from each single object present in an image. We demonstrate that our MCMS model improves object segmentation performance in electron microscopy images and provides a coherent segmentation of multiple objects. Through speeding up the segmentation process, the proposed method will allow neurobiologists to move beyond individual specimens and analyze populations paving the way for understanding neurodegenerative diseases at the microscopic level.",Context;Mathematical model;Context modeling;Image segmentation;Equations;Computational modeling;Training;Image segmentation;contextual information;artificial neural networks;series classifier;electron microscopy imaging;neuroscience;connectomics,ARTICLE,2013,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2013.2274388

The innovation is in the minds,"The brain is an amazingly complex and efficient machine. While it may not be considered ""general purpose"" in terms of its computational capabilities, it performs a set of functions such as feature extraction, classification, synthesis, recognition, learning, and higher-order decision-making amazingly well. Unfortunately the dynamic behavior of the brain at large is still marginally understood. One of the major charters in the neuroscience community for the next decade is to create a dynamic map of the brain (as articulated by the Obama administration in the US). Doing so will require the most advanced imaging capabilities operating at the scale of 10's of microns. Recent advances in microscopic sensing, processing and communications are leading to brain-machine interfaces that may be able to observe thousands if not millions of active neurons in vivo. These nanomorphic systems represent the frontier in miniaturization and integration of electronic information processing systems. This whole effort may in turn have some interesting repercussions on how information-processing systems themselves are conceived in the nanoscale regime. Neuro-inspired processing presents an attractive alternative to the classical Von-Neumann computing paradigm in deeply scaled regimes: it thrives on randomness and variability, processing is performed in the continuous or discrete domains, and massive parallelism, major redundancy and adaptivity are of essence. Computational paradigms inspired by neural information processing hence may lead to energy-efficient, low-cost, dense and/or reliable implementations of the functions the brain excels at. In this presentation, we will explore both sides of this neuroscience-information technology interaction. One thing is for sure - the joint future will be exciting.",Information processing;Technological innovation;Educational institutions;Abstracts;Feature extraction;Decision making;Neuroscience,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,5th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces IWASI,10.1109/IWASI.2013.6576099
Listeria monocytogenes Colony Counting from Microscopic Images Using Nonlinear Piecewise Least-Square Curve-Fitting Filter,"This paper proposes a novel method to enhance out-of-focus regions in microscopic images and detect Listeria Monocytogenes(L. monocytogenes.) in biofilm on a conveyor belt from an image with the aim to count the colonies of L. monocytogenes. Consider that a microscope can focus on a single point in the sample, this limitation makes each image contain both in-focus and out-of-focus regions. These out-of- focus regions are blurred with different blurring scale, thus the proposed method uses nonlinear piecewise least-square curve-fitting filter and the gradient to enhance the out-of-focus regions. Finally, watershed algorithm and morphological operations are used to segment and count the colonies. The proposed method was evaluated on a set of 30 L. monocytogenes microscopic images and a set of 90 synthetic test images. The counting results reveal that our proposed method can improve the quality of an image by enhancing the out-of-focus regions while preserving other regions which leads to more accurate counting results.",Curve fitting;Image segmentation;Microorganisms;Microscopy;Filtering algorithms;Morphological operations;Standards;Listeria monocytogenes colony counting;nonlinear piecewise least-square curve-fitting filte;watershed algorithm;out-of-focus blurred images,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 International Conference on Information Science and Applications (ICISA),10.1109/ICISA.2013.6579390

Biomediated synthesis of silver nanodendrites,A simple green method is used for the synthesis of silver (Ag) nanodendrites. The aqueous leaf extract of Rhizophora apicualata was used for the synthesis of Ag nanodendrites. The bioorganic components present in the aqueous extract acted as a reducing agent. The absorption maxima of silver nanoparticle are confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) suggest the crystalline nature of Ag nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed the formation of silver nanodendrites. The morphology of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) varied with the concentration of the precursor metal salts.

A quantitative analysis of F-actin features and distribution in fluorescence microscopy images to distinguish cells with different modes of motility,"Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryote cells, playing a key role in cell dynamic morphological alterations and tumor metastatic spread. To investigate the relationship between the distribution patterns of actin and the aggressiveness of cancer cells, we developed an image analysis framework for quantifying cell F-actin distributions examined with fluorescence microscopy. The images are first segmented with multichannel information of both F-actin and nuclear staining. Using the watershed method and Voronoi tessellation, the cells can be well segmented based on both F-actin and nuclear information. Altogether, sixteen F-actin distribution features are calculated for each individual cell. A linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then applied in the feature space to separate cells with different modes of motility. Our results show that cells with different modes of motility can be distinguished by F-actin distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first study managing to distinguish cancer cells with different aggressiveness based on quantitative analysis of F-actin distribution patterns.",Image segmentation;Cancer;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Biomedical imaging;Nuclear measurements,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609456
Multi-channels statistical and morphological features based mitosis detection in breast cancer histopathology,"Accurate counting of mitosis in breast cancer histopathology plays a critical role in the grading process. Manual counting of mitosis is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and intra-reader variations. This work aims at improving the accuracy of mitosis detection by selecting the color channels that better capture the statistical and morphological features having mitosis discrimination from other objects. The proposed framework includes comprehensive analysis of first and second order statistical features together with morphological features in selected color channels and a study on balancing the skewed dataset using SMOTE method for increasing the predictive accuracy of mitosis classification. The proposed framework has been evaluated on MITOS data set during an ICPR 2012 contest and ranked second from 17 finalists. The proposed framework achieved 74% detection rate, 70% precision and 72% F-Measure.

Cell nuclei segmentation in fluorescence microscopy images using inter- and intra-region discriminative information,"Automated segmentation of cell nuclei in microscopic images is critical to high throughput analysis of the ever increasing amount of data. Although cell nuclei are generally visually distinguishable for human, automated segmentation faces challenges when there is significant intensity inhomogeneity among cell nuclei or in the background. In this paper, we propose an effective method for automated cell nucleus segmentation using a three-step approach. It first obtains an initial segmentation by extracting salient regions in the image, then reduces false positives using inter-region feature discrimination, and finally refines the boundary of the cell nuclei using intra-region contrast information. This method has been evaluated on two publicly available datasets of fluorescence microscopic images with 4009 cells, and has achieved superior performance compared to popular state of the art methods using established metrics.",Image segmentation;Labeling;Microscopy;Nonhomogeneous media;Graphical models;Feature extraction;Noise measurement,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610941
Quantitative analysis of peri-tumor tissue elasticity based on shear-wave elastography for breast tumor classification,"For shear-wave elastography (SWE) images, the most common site of tumor-associated stiffness is generally in the surrounding stroma rather than the tumor itself. The aim of this study is to assess the value of the peri-tumor tissue elasticity in the classification of breast tumors. SWE images of 106 breast tumors (65 benign, 41 malignant) were collected from 82 consecutive patients. By applying the image processing method, 5 elastographic features of the peri-tumor area (elasticity modulus mean, maximum, standard deviation, hardness degree and elasticity ratio) were computed to represent peri-tumor tissue elasticity. B-mode Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) were used for comparing the diagnostic performances between the grayscale US and color SWE images. Histopathologic results were used as the reference standard. The t-test, point biserial correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed for statistical analysis. As a result, the Az values (area under ROC curve) were 0.92, 0.95, 0.94, 0.91, and 0.98 for the classifiers using the five elastographic features respectively, and 0.91 for BI-RADS assessment.

Classification of Tumor Histology via Morphometric Context,"Image-based classification of tissue histology, in terms of different components (e.g., normal signature, categories of aberrant signatures), provides a series of indices for tumor composition. Subsequently, aggregation of these indices in each whole slide image (WSI) from a large cohort can provide predictive models of clinical outcome. However, the performance of the existing techniques is hindered as a result of large technical and biological variations that are always present in a large cohort. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for classification of tissue histology based on robust representations of morphometric context, which are built upon nuclear level morphometric features at various locations and scales within the spatial pyramid matching (SPM) framework. These methods have been evaluated on two distinct datasets of different tumor types collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the experimental results indicate that our methods are (i) extensible to different tumor types, (ii) robust in the presence of wide technical and biological variations, (iii) invariant to different nuclear segmentation strategies, and (iv) scalable with varying training sample size. In addition, our experiments suggest that enforcing sparsity, during the construction of morphometric context, further improves the performance of the system.",Kernel;Image segmentation;Tumors;Dictionaries;Context;Training;Histograms,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/CVPR.2013.286

An automatic mitosis detection method for breast cancer histopathology slide images based on objective and pixel-wise textural features classification,"Study of histopathological cancerous tissue is one of the most reliable ways to grade various types of cancers. The result of grading helps the physicians to diagnose and prescribe suitable prognosis. The focus of this paper is on a CAD for automatic analysis of breast cancer histopathological Images to count mitosis as an important criteria for the breast cancer grading. To achieve this aim, sets of specific digital histopathological data are used which are captured by particular microscopic scanners named as Aperio XT and Hamamatsu NanoZoomer scanners. In the proposed method, these acquired images are employed and processed based on digital image processing approaches like 2-D anisotropic diffusion as a pre-process and morphological process. For extraction of pixel-wise features from predetermined mitotic regions, an statistical approach based on color information such as maximum likelihood estimation is employed. To prevent misclassification of mitosis and non-mitosis objects, an object-wise completed local binary pattern (CLBP) is proposed to extract texture features robust against rotation and color-level changes, and finally support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the extracted feature vectors. Having computed the evaluation criteria, our proposed method performs better f-measure (70.94% for Aperio XT scanner images and 70.11% for Hamamatsu images) among the methods proposed by other participants at ICPR2012 Mitosis detection in breast cancer histopathological images.",Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Support vector machines;Maximum likelihood estimation;Biomedical imaging;Microscopy;Training;Completed Local Binary Pattern (CLBP);Histopathology;Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE);Pixel-and object-wise classification;Support Vector Machine (SVM),INPROCEEDINGS,2013,The 5th Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology,10.1109/IKT.2013.6620101

In this research, we investigate multi-modal genomic, proteomic, and histopathological image data integration for prediction of ovarian cancer clinical endpoints in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Specifically, we study two data integration techniques, simple data concatenation and ensemble classification, to determine whether they can improve prediction of ovarian cancer grade or patient survival. Results indicate that integration via ensemble classification is more effective than simple data concatenation.

Detecting Symmetry in Scalar Fields Using Augmented Extremum Graphs,Visualizing symmetric patterns in the data often helps the domain scientists make important observations and gain insights about the underlying experiment. Detecting symmetry in scalar fields is a nascent area of research and existing methods that detect symmetry are either not robust in the presence of noise or computationally costly. We propose a data structure called the augmented extremum graph and use it to design a novel symmetry detection method based on robust estimation of distances. The augmented extremum graph captures both topological and geometric information of the scalar field and enables robust and computationally efficient detection of symmetry. We apply the proposed method to detect symmetries in cryo-electron microscopy datasets and the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of detecting symmetry even in the presence of significant noise. We describe novel applications that use the detected symmetry to enhance visualization of scalar field data and facilitate their exploration.,Computer graphics;Robustness;Geometry;Histograms;Symmetric matrices;Feature extraction;Computer graphics;Robustness;Geometry;Histograms;Symmetric matrices;Feature extraction;data exploration;Scalar field visualization;extremum graph;Morse decomposition;symmetry detection,ARTICLE,2013,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,10.1109/TVCG.2013.148

Pathological Image Retrieval for Breast Cancer with pLSA Model,"Pathological image retrieval contributes to computer-aided diagnosis for breast cancer due to the fact that the retrieval results generally contain detailed diagnostic information (e.g. abnormal regions and diagnostic opinion from other doctors) which can offer some reference and assistance to the doctor during diagnosis process. In this paper, we present a novel pathological image retrieval approach based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) model. The method respectively utilizes SIFT features after visual saliency detection, and block Gabor features for the construction of two semantic codebooks, which not only can characterize the salient local invariant features and texture information under different scales and orientations in the pathological images, but also consider the high-level semantic features. Furthermore, we apply pLSA model to discover the latent topics in each codebook. Finally each pathological image is represented by the combination of topics from these two codebooks. The proposed method is evaluated on the pathological image database for breast cancer, which includes 5 categories (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, basal-like carcinoma, invasive breast cancer and low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma) and 110 cases for each category.

Hybrid segmentation of breast cancer cell images using a new fuzzy active contour model and an enhanced watershed method,"Segmentation is the main sensitive problem in the automatic image analysis of histopathology specimens. In the stained breast image tissue, cancer cells present a large variety in their characteristics that bring various difficulties for traditional segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method for breast cancer cell images combining a new fuzzy active contour model and an enhanced watershed method. Firstly, a color geometric active contour model incorporating spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed to detect the contours of all cell nuclei in the image. It combines the classical level set method, together with a Bayes error functional based on color region information. Moreover, the initial contour and the controlling parameters of the model are estimated from the fuzzy clustering results. Secondly, overlapping and touching cell nuclei are separated using an enhanced watershed algorithm based on concave vertex graph. Touching nuclei are located automatically using a robust high concavity point detector. Then, the watershed algorithm is applied on hybrid distance transform in order to get the most significant inner edges. A vertex graph is constructed from the concave points and the inner edges followed by an optimal path computed to select the separating curves of the touching nuclei. The proposed segmentation method is tested on a large dataset containing several breast cancer cell images with different levels of malignancy. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm when compared to other recent segmentation methods.",Image segmentation;Level set;Active contours;Clustering algorithms;Breast cancer;Image edge detection;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Medical image analysis;Breast cancer;Active contours;Spatial fuzzy clustering;Watersheds;Graph theory,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,"2013 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)",10.1109/CoDIT.2013.6689575
In-situ holography microscopy of plankton and particles over the continental shelf of Senegal,"We present the first results obtained by a newly developed submersible digital holography microscope (DHM), Holoflow@Sea, to enable continuous in-situ monitoring of ocean or fresh water bodies in a less intrusive manner. The microscope features an off-axis configuration with reduced-coherence illumination. The optics is designed to image plankton and particles in the size range 2 μm-200μm within a water volume of 1 mm × 1 mm × 2 mm. The prototype was successfully deployed for the first time over the continental shelf of Senegal during a fisheries survey carried out in March 2013. The objective was to combine several laboratory techniques used for plankton and particle identification (high-performance liquid chromatography, flow cytometry and optical microscopy) on discrete collected samples with DHM images taken in situ at locations with different environmental conditions. Hologram data were acquired inside an upwelling cell, i.e., new water, and along the coast, i.e., old water, as well as off the upwelling cell at the continental shelf border. Preliminary results of holographic reconstruction are encouraging, with the distinctive morphology of some phytoplankton species allowing easy identification to genera level. Challenges are recognised with the identification of small spheroid organisms.

For every detected key point, a rectangular region is selected and feature vector (feature descriptor) for respective key point is generated using Histogram of Oriented gradients (HOG). All the feature vectors are then matched in both the images to generate the Transformation Matrix (containing transformation values of image in x-y direction) which is used to align target image.

Histopathological prostate tissue glands segmentation for automated diagnosis,"In this work, we propose a methodology for segmenting glands automatically in digitized images of histopathological prostate tissue for grade classification. Gleason grading describes the abnormality of cancer cells and their degree of aggressiveness by using numerical scale from grade 1 that represents benign tissues through grade 5 for tissues characterized as advanced stage cancer. The special characteristics of glands in prostate tissue for each grade play a significant role in discriminating Gleason grades. Therefore, lumen objects and tissue glands were segmented as the major regions of interest for tissue grading. Lumen objects were segmented by an empirical thresholding technique. Since we are mainly concerned with the inner regions of the glands consisting of the lumen, cytoplasm and the inner boundary of the cell nuclei, a k-means clustering approach was employed to the a* color channel of the L*a*b* color model for each of the tissue images. This was followed by statistical and morphological features extraction for the segmented lumen objects and glands. Finally, a naive Bayes classifier was used to classify tissue images to the correct grade. The efficiency of the automated segmentation method was evaluated, and classification results achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.66%, 96.66%, and 95.00%, respectively. These results indicate that our automated methodology could serve as an adjunct to histopathologists and would have a positive impact when integrated with conventional histopathological diagnosis procedures.",Glands;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Image color analysis;Level set;Cancer;Prostate tissue;Gleason grading;gland segmentation;Naive Bayes classifier,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE Jordan Conference on Applied Electrical Engineering and Computing Technologies (AEECT),10.1109/AEECT.2013.6716471

A novel approach for ensemble clustering of colon biopsy images,"Colon cancer diagnosis based on microscopic analysis of biopsy sample is a common medical practice. However, the process is subjective, biased and leads to interobserver variability. Further, histopathologists have to analyze many biopsy samples per day. Therefore, factors such as tiredness, experience and workload of histopathologists also affect the diagnosis. These shortcomings require a supporting system, which can help the histopathologists in accurately determining cancer. Image segmentation is one of the techniques, which can help in efficiently segregating colon biopsy image into constituent regions, and accurately localizing the cancer. In this work, we propose a novel colon biopsy image segmentation technique, wherein segmentation has been posed as a classification problem. Local binary patterns (LTP), local ternary patters (LTP), and Haralick features are extracted for each pixel of colon biopsy images. Features are reduced using genetic algorithms and F-Score. Reduced features are given as input to random forest, rotation forest, and rotation boost classifiers for segregation of image into normal, malignant and connecting tissues components. The clustering performance has been evaluated using segmentation accuracy and Davies bouldin index (DBI). Performance of classifiers has also been evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC). It is observed that rotation boost in combination with F-Score has shown better results in segmenting the images compared to other classifiers.",Feature extraction;Colon;Cancer;Biopsy;Image segmentation;Genetics;Accuracy;Colon biopsy;Segmentation;LTP;LBP;Haralick,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 11th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology,10.1109/FIT.2013.12

Although many segmentation algorithms have been proposed in image processing and pattern recognition fields, most approaches are designed for some specific tasks and may not work well for other tasks. This makes it difficult to find an algorithm suitable for a given task for biologists who do not have knowledge about segmentation algorithms. Automatic selection of an appropriate segmentation algorithm including its parameters efficiently has become a very important duty, since recent advances in cell and sub-cellular imaging technology significantly increases a number of observed images for biologists. In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation system which has the function of performance evaluation. The set of candidate algorithms including parameter variation are automatically generated by using combinations of the prescribed image processing methods implemented in our system, and the system is designed in order to add and replace these algorithms easily. Their segmentation qualities are evaluated by comparing each result with the ground-truth provided by biologists based on either a single or multiple similarity metrics. Finally, our system predicts which algorithm will provide the best performance on a set of images similar to the original image with ground-truth reference. We examine our system using typical segmentation algorithms under several evaluation metrics and find it useful especially for detection of fluorescent labeled targets with granular shapes on real sub-cellular images, as well as simulated images with small sub-cellular objects.",Image segmentation;Algorithm design and analysis;Biology;Fluorescence;Prediction algorithms;Performance evaluation;Cell image segmentation;Performance evaluation;algorithm selection;Similarity measure;fluorescent microscopy image,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking,10.1109/CANDAR.2013.51
High-performance computational analysis of glioblastoma pathology images with database support identifies molecular and survival correlates,"In this paper, we present a novel framework for microscopic image analysis of nuclei, data management, and high performance computation to support translational research involving nuclear morphometry features, molecular data, and clinical outcomes. Our image analysis pipeline consists of nuclei segmentation and feature computation facilitated by high performance computing with coordinated execution in multi-core CPUs and Graphical Processor Units (GPUs). All data derived from image analysis are managed in a spatial relational database supporting highly efficient scientific queries. We applied our image analysis workflow to 159 glioblastomas (GBM) from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. With integrative studies, we found statistics of four specific nuclear features were significantly associated with patient survival. Additionally, we correlated nuclear features with molecular data and found interesting results that support pathologic domain knowledge. We found that Proneural subtype GBMs had the smallest mean of nuclear Eccentricity and the largest mean of nuclear Extent, and MinorAxisLength. We also found gene expressions of stem cell marker MYC and cell proliferation maker MKI67 were correlated with nuclear features. To complement and inform pathologists of relevant diagnostic features, we queried the most representative nuclear instances from each patient population based on genetic and transcriptional classes. Our results demonstrate that specific nuclear features carry prognostic significance and associations with transcriptional and genetic classes, highlighting the potential of high throughput pathology image analysis as a complementary approach to human-based review and translational research.",Image analysis;Pathology;Image segmentation;Image reconstruction;Microscopy;Spatial databases;Gene expression;Glioblastoma;large-scale image analysis;survival analysis;phenotype-genotype integration;translational research,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine,10.1109/BIBM.2013.6732495
Automatic working area localization in blood smear microscopic images using machine learning algorithms,"Microscopic examination of a properly prepared blood smear is valuable in complete blood count (CBC) and differential blood count (DBC). A hematopathologist may spend enormous time manually inspecting the good working area (GWA) of the blood smear under a light microscope system to perform CBC or DBC. In this paper we focus on automatic localization of the GWA by classifying microscopic images of blood smears using different machine learning algorithms into three areas: Clumped, Good, and Sparse. The features used are the statistical and texture features. This approach yields a good localization of GWA in images acquired by a low cost light microscope system, scanned under magnifying power of x100 oil-immersed objective. Our experiment using images with resolution (3488×2616 pixels) of Giemsa-stained blood smears shows that the proposed method has an accuracy of 82% for the localizing the GWA and 79.73% for all areas in a validation set of 301 images.",Blood;Decision support systems;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Decision trees;Classification algorithms;Good Working Area (GWA);White Blood Cells (WBCs);KNN Classifier;Decision tree;AdaBoost;Microscopic Images;Blood Smear Examination,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine,10.1109/BIBM.2013.6732733
Detection of microfilariae in peripheral blood smears using image analysis,"Lymphatic filariasis is a leading cause of permanent disability in many countries. Due to its asymptomatic and epidemiological characteristics, the whole population living in threatened areas needs to be screened. The popular diagnostic method involves the manual microscopic observation of nocturnal blood smears in order to detect the presence of microfilariae. Due its strenuous and mundane nature, considerable detection errors are observed. This paper presents an image-based technique for diagnosis of filariasis through the detection of microfilariae present in Giemsa or Hematoxylin and Eosin stained peripheral thick blood smears. The proposed method uses connected component analysis and dynamic thresholding to detect microfilariae in images acquired from the microscope eyepiece. A sensitivity of 91.42% and a specificity of 88.57% were observed on experiments conducted on a database of 70 Images.",Blood;Image color analysis;Microscopy;Medical diagnostic imaging;Conferences;Diseases;Microfilariae detection;computer aided diagnosis;connected component analysis;object detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE 8th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems,10.1109/ICIInfS.2013.6731999
Effect of fullerenol on the morphology features of SW480 cells,"Paper discusses the effect of fullerenol on the morphology features of colon cancer SW480 cells. In the work, the changes of morphology features of SW480 cells, treated with three groups of fullerenol concentrations, were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to evaluate their induction of apoptosis in colon cancer cells on the nanoscale. There were 20 single cells of each group used to test and determine the changes of their features in the experiments, including untreated SW480 cells, SW480 cells treated with Img/ml fullerenol and SW480 cells treated with 2mg/ml fullerenol. The experimental results have shown that the untreated and treated SW480 cells have different sizes and shapes.

Vector field convolution medialness applied to neuron tracing,"In this paper we propose a novel approach to the extraction of medial axis for grayscale objects. The method utilizes a computationally efficient vector field convolution to enhance the medialness feature. Local maxima of medialness are analyzed in scale space, yielding a robust medial axis for grayscale imagery. An important application of this work is the segmentation of neurons from noisy, cluttered microscopy images. Existing neuron segmentation methods depend heavily on accurate, noise-insensitive medial axis extraction. We propose the vector field convolution medialness operation as a first step in segmenting neurons. The proposed method requires no complex parameters or an initial binarization step. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated by a 60% reduction root mean squared error (2.9 pixels) as compared to an approach based on gradient vector flow.",Neurons;Vectors;Kernel;Skeleton;Convolution;Microscopy;Image segmentation;skeleton;VFC;neuron segmentation;microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738137
Three dimensional segmentation of fluorescence microscopy images using active surfaces,"Three dimensional image volumes collected using optical microscopy exhibit many characteristics that cause difficulty in segmentation. These include decreasing image contrast with increasing tissue depth, poor edge detail with regard to cellular structures, and limited spatial resolution. This paper describes a three dimensional segmentation method utilizing active surfaces to segment microscopy image volumes. We demonstrate this method on a three dimensional sequence of images acquired from stationary/stabilized kidney tissue of a rat. Results from this method are compared against a prior pseudo-three dimensional segmentation method that analyzes slices on a single image-by-image basis, as well as against another native three dimensional segmentation method.",Image segmentation;Surface morphology;Microscopy;Image edge detection;Optical microscopy;Active contours;Biomedical optical imaging;image segmentation;biomedical optical imaging;optical microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738238
Automatic microscopy image stitching based on geometry features,"In this paper, we present an automatic image stitching method for Virtual Microscopy (VM). The method aims to integrate a number of fields of view into a large image which captures the whole view of a biomedical specimen. The method aligns the images based on matching of local features. To assure matching accuracy, feature points are efficiently detected using integral images. In addition, the local features are matched by incorporating geometry features. The mismatched feature points are filtered out by RANSAC algorithm, which provides robust estimation of the transformation between images.

Classification of colon biopsy images based on novel structural features,"Microscopic analysis of colon biopsy samples is a common medical practice for identifying colon cancer. However, the process is subjective, and leads to significant inter-observer/intra-observer variability. Further, pathologists have to examine many biopsy samples per day, therefore, factors such as expertise and workload of the histopathologists also affect the diagnosis. These limitations of the manual process result in the need of a computer-aided diagnostic system, which can help the histopathologists in accurately determining cancer. Image classification is one of such computer-aided techniques, which can help in efficiently identifying normal and malignant colon biopsy samples without the need of subjective involvement of histopathologists. In this work, we propose a colon biopsy image classification technique, wherein two novel structural feature types, namely, white run-length features and percentage cluster area features have been introduced These features are calculated for each colon biopsy image. The features are reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). The original and the reduced feature sets are then given as input to random forest, rotation forest, and rotation boost classifiers for classification of images into normal and malignant categories. The proposed technique has been evaluated on 174 colon biopsy images, and promising performance has been observed in terms of various well-known performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The proposed technique has also been proven to be better compared to previously published techniques in the experimental section. Further, performance of the classifiers has been evaluated using ROC curves, and area under the curve (AUC). It has been observed that rotation boost classifier in combination with PCA based feature selection has shown better results in classification compared to other classifiers.",Colon;Biopsy;Cancer;Accuracy;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Image classification;Colon biopsy;Classification;PCA;run lengths,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET),10.1109/ICET.2013.6743488
Volumetric Semantic Segmentation Using Pyramid Context Features,"We present an algorithm for the per-voxel semantic segmentation of a three-dimensional volume. At the core of our algorithm is a novel ""pyramid context"" feature, a descriptive representation designed such that exact per-voxel linear classification can be made extremely efficient. This feature not only allows for efficient semantic segmentation but enables other aspects of our algorithm, such as novel learned features and a stacked architecture that can reason about self-consistency. We demonstrate our technique on 3D fluorescence microscopy data of Drosophila embryos for which we are able to produce extremely accurate semantic segmentations in a matter of minutes, and for which other algorithms fail due to the size and high-dimensionality of the data, or due to the difficulty of the task.",Context;Semantics;Feature extraction;Vectors;Embryo;Algorithm design and analysis;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision,10.1109/ICCV.2013.428
Computational cell classification methodology for hepatocellular carcinoma,"Liver cancer is one of the frequent causes of death in the world. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common histological type of primary liver cancer. HCC can be graded according to the malignancy of the tumors. Generally, a HCC grade is determined based on the characteristics of liver cell nuclei. This paper illustrates a methodology for classifying liver cell nuclei and grading HCC histological images quantitatively. The liver cell nuclei are classified in three consecutive tasks: nuclear segmentation, fibrous region detection, and nuclear classification. Each task utilizes the pixel-based textural features that are obtained through multifractal computation on digital images. First, the system segments every possible type of nuclei and excludes the nuclei within fibrous regions. Then, it classifies the rest of the nuclei to discriminate liver cell nuclei. For tumor grading, this method utilizes the following four categories of nuclear features: inner texture, geometry, spatial distribution, and surrounding texture. The proposed method was employed to classify a set of HCC histological images into five.",Liver;Fractals;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Tumors;Histograms;Cancer;Multifractal computation;Multifractal measures;Textural feature descriptor;Segmentation;Feature selection;Cancer grading;HCC histological images,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer),10.1109/ICTer.2013.6761150
A novel multi-cue based image fusion method combining multi-principle microscopy images towards Nuclear transfer technology,"Since its invention, the Nuclear transfer technology has a wide range of applications in fields such as animal breeding, gene therapy, organ transplants, etc.. However, since the oosight genetic material is not visible, presently the nucleus removal process of recipient oocyte always take the blind suction method, which led to extremely low success rate of nuclear transfer operation. Polarized light microscopy imaging system is very suitable for non -invasive imaging of living oocyte spindle. However, comparing to inverted microscopic imaging, it lost a lot of operating environment information (such as precision positioning of manipulation tools and cellular texture). In this paper, the advantages of polarized light microscopy imaging systems and traditional optical inverted microscope imaging system are combined. The fusion of images from polarized light microscopy imaging systems and traditional optical inverted microscope imaging system was realized. Collecting the polarized light microscopy image and inverted microscope image of same oosights in real time using two CCD cameras. A multi-cue image fusion method is proposed in this manuscript, experimental results show that this method is expected to achieve real-time visualized operation and observation.",Image fusion;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Materials;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,The 7th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Molecular Medicine and Engineering,10.1109/NANOMED.2013.6766307
Probing cancer cell responses via using physically-modified chitosan nanosponges,"This paper describes the development of physically-modified chitosan nanosponges to probe cellular behaviors and molecular-level structural responses of MDA-MB-231 cells (human breast cancer cells) adhered onto these modified nanosponges. After 4 and 12 hours culture, MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated to decipher the cellular responses on these chitosan nanosponges through using scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. We found that MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited distinct structurally based responses attributable to chitosan nanosponges that we demonstrate as possibly applicable, for drug screening applications. In addition, we developed a chitosan-based micropatterning procedure that allowed us to re-arrange mammalian cells (i.e., HeLa cells in this study, for cancer drug screening) at the desired locations (with a single-cell array format). We believe that this study would provide further understanding of naturally derived biomaterials and facilitate the development of new biomedical devices with unique cell-material interface properties and characteristics, such as in-vitro cell culture and diagnostic platforms.",Nanobioscience;Silicon;Biomembranes;Cancer;Chemicals;Surface topography;Substrates;chitosan;nanosponges;cancer cell;cell behaviors,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,The 7th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Molecular Medicine and Engineering,10.1109/NANOMED.2013.6766322
Study of morphological changes of neuroblastoma cells induced by activation of NMDA receptor,"Neurodegeneration has been recognized as the main cause for neuronal diseases. Much effort has been paid to investigate the process of neurodegeneration from the viewpoint of molecular biology. However, the mechanisms of some processes are still unclear.

Microfluidic platforms for capturing circulating tumor cells,"We present the results of a simple, low-cost microfluidic device that can be used to isolate and capture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from whole blood. The device was made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) consisting of a microfluidic channel with microposts coated with ligand proteins. A total of 32 devices were designed, each containing different patterns in terms of shape, size, spacing, and arrangement of the microposts. The microposts were coated with anti-epithelial-cell adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM) that has been extensively used in isolating CTCs from blood [1 - 4]. After flowing the blood sample through the devices, the captured cancer cells were quantified with optical microscopy. A comparative study of the capture efficiencies of the devices was performed based on the micropost features and sample flow rates. It was found that microposts with circular or square cross sections performed significantly better than triangular ones. Also, 100 μm posts arranged in an offset array with 50 μm gap was better than other designs in this study, reaching a capture efficiency of almost 50%.",Cancer;Blood;Cells (biology);Microfluidics;Arrays;Tumors;Proteins;microfluidic;platforms;tumor;cells,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,The 7th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Molecular Medicine and Engineering,10.1109/NANOMED.2013.6766305
Classification of hardwood species using ANN classifier,"In this paper, an approach for the classification of different hardwood species of open access database, using texture feature extraction and supervised machine learning technique has been implemented.

Mammary Gland Tumor Detection in Cats Using Ant Colony Optimisation,"Mammary gland tumors are among the most common tumors in cats. Over 85 percent of mammary tumors in cats are malignant and they tend to grow and metastasize quickly to different organs like lungs and lymph nodes. Similar to breast tumors in humans, they start as a small lump in a mammary gland and then grow and increase in size unless detected and treated. In this paper, we present an approach to detect broadenoma mammary gland tumors in cats using ant colony optimisation. Image features can then be extracted from the segmented image regions. To evaluate the performance of our presented approach, 25 microscopical images were taken from tissue slides of broadenomas from three cat cases.

Nanoscopy with focused light,"For more than a century, it has been generally accepted that the resolution of a lens-based optical microscope is limited to about d = λ /(2NA) > 200 nm in the focal plane and > 500 nm along the optic axis, with NA denoting the numerical aperture of the lens and λ the wavelength of light. The discovery in the 1990's that elementary transitions between the states of a fluorophore can be used to eliminate the limiting role of diffraction has led to light microscopy concepts with resolution on the nanometer scale. Currently, all existing and successfully applied nanoscopy methods share a common enabling element: they switch fluorescence on or off, so that adjacent features are registered sequentially in time.",Optical switches;Microscopy;Fluorescence;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Optical diffraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 Conference on Lasers & Electro-Optics Europe & International Quantum Electronics Conference CLEO EUROPE/IQEC,10.1109/CLEOE-IQEC.2013.6802007
Scanless two-photon microscopy with a 30 fs laser by means of a diffractive dispersion compensation module,"Summary form only given. Scanless two-photon microscopy uses a spatial light modulator (SLM) to shape the incoming laser beam into any user-defined light pattern. These microscopes, that do not contain mechanically moving parts, improve the temporal resolution of conventional scanning multiphoton microscopy since they highly mitigate the severe temporal limitations inherent to sequential scanning of the sample [1]. However, diffractive optical elements encoded into a SLM for multiphoton microscopy prevent the use of ultrafast sources (say, pulses shorter than 100 fs) due to huge dispersion (both spatial and temporal), which limits high resolution nonlinear excitation [2]. We have engineered a simple dispersion-compensated module (DCM) based on the diffractive lens-pair configuration shown in Ref. [3] that permits to extend the range of pulsed sources available for scanless multiphoton microscopes to ultrashort femtosecond pulses. In this way, we strongly alleviate some unwanted effects (specifically, spatial chirp and pulse-front tilt).Our experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1(a). A mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser that emits pulses of 30 fs temporal width, 800 nm central wavelength, at 1 kHz repetition rate is used as pulsed source. The pulsed laser beam impinges by means of a beam splitter onto a Fourier computer generated hologram (CGH) encoded into a phase-only SLM. The dashed box in Fig. 1(a) is the DCM. It is made up of a lens achromat L1 (focal length f1 300 =) mm coupled to a diffractive lens pair, DL1 and DL2. The focal lengths of DL1 and DL2, for the central wavelength of the laser are f01 = -150 mm and f02 150 = , mm respectively. The distances between the optical elements are l=300 mm and d=d'=150 mm. After the DCM, in order to properly excite the fluorescence signal in Rhodamine B (RB), we use a telescope with a refractive lens L2 (focal length f2 100 =) mm and a 20X microscope objective MO1 with focal distance 10 mm. To observe the fluorescence signal, the RB plane is imaged onto a conventional CCD sensor by means of a 50X microscope objective MO2. We place a suited filter F before the CCD camera to prevent from propagation of the infrared signal.In the experiment we encoded the outline of a bicycle on the CGH. The theoretical reconstruction is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The average power was adjusted to 3mW to ensure wide-field fluorescence signalling. When we do not use the DCM, we realize that spatial and temporal broadening of the pulse at the sample plane makes useless the diffractive SLM, and in fact no signal is recorded. The fluorescence signal was subsequently recovered when we employed the DCM (see Fig. 1(d)). The dispersion compensation abilities of the DCM preserve the temporal width of the laser pulse at the sample plane, and consequently the fluorescence signal increases with respect to the uncompensated situation. Note that the number of emitted photons at the sample depends inversely on the pulse width. Furthermore, transverse spatial resolution for the CGH reconstruction is also maintained due to the spatial chirp compensation capacity of the module. Finally, we check that diffractiondriven fluorescence signalling is possible without the DCM, but at the expense of using an extra 2mW average power to compensate for temporal broadening, see Fig. 1(c). However, the uncompensated spatial chirp leads to a blurred signal that prevents correct hologram reconstruction and thus irradiance patterning.",Microscopy;Fluorescence;Optical microscopy;Laser beams;Ultrafast optics;Lasers;Dispersion,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 Conference on Lasers & Electro-Optics Europe & International Quantum Electronics Conference CLEO EUROPE/IQEC,10.1109/CLEOE-IQEC.2013.6800854

Chasing the neurome: Segmentation and comparison of neurons,"The neuronal content of an organism, the individual morphology of each neuron and the variability of these components constitute the atlas of the neurome. The description of such an atlas will be critical in determining the complex neural system of a given organism, eventually providing clues to how animals think and function. As the organisms under investigation scale from the worm to the human, the number of neurons scale from tens to millions. Image analysis is a key ingredient in tackling a neurome for complex organisms. Specifically, two major problems stand between the state of the art and successful automation. First, neurons must be segmented from microscopy, yielding a morphological description of each individual neuron. Second, these neurons must be matched to prototypes and classified by function.

Feature Extraction of Human Viruses Microscopic Images Using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix,"With the development of information technology in biomedical signal detection, processing and digital image signal processing, the role of automatic visual recognition becomes more important.

Firstly, 20 pieces of microscopic images of human virus are obtained by using GLCM, and then the four texture feature parameters, entropy, energy, inertia moment and correlation are extracted utilizing the GLCM, and then HV image recognition is carried out. The experimental results show that the GLCM and extraction of image texture features can effectively identify the HV image, which can bring significance to the modern recognition and identification of HV.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Viruses (medical);Image recognition;Entropy;Image texture;Correlation;feature extraction;GLCM;human viruses microscopic images,INPROCEEDINGS,2013,2013 International Conference on Computer Sciences and Applications,10.1109/CSA.2013.149
A Fully Automated System for Adherent Cells Microinjection,"This paper proposes an automated robotic system to perform cell microinjections to relieve human operators from this highly difficult and tedious manual procedure. The system, which uses commercial equipment currently found on most biomanipulation laboratories, consists of a multitask software framework combining computer vision and robotic control elements. The vision part features an injection pipette tracker and an automatic cell targeting system that is responsible for defining injection points within the contours of adherent cells in culture. The main challenge is the use of bright-field microscopy only, without the need for chemical markers normally employed to highlight the cells. Here, cells are identified and segmented using a threshold-based image processing technique working on defocused images. Fast and precise microinjection pipette positioning over the automatically defined targets is performed by a two-stage robotic system which achieves an average injection rate of 7.6 cells/min with a pipette positioning precision of 0.23 μm. The consistency of these microinjections and the performance of the visual targeting framework were experimentally evaluated using two cell lines (CHO-K1 and HEK) and over 500 cells. In these trials, the cells were automatically targeted and injected with a fluorescent marker, resulting in a correct cell detection rate of 87% and a successful marker delivery rate of 67.5%. These results demonstrate that the new system is capable of better performances than expert operators, highlighting its benefits and potential for large-scale application.",Microinjection;Microscopy;Robots;Measurement;Image segmentation;Tuning;Shape;Cell microinjection;defocusing microscopy;robotic biomanipulation,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2013.2248161
Removing Batch Effects From Histopathological Images for Enhanced Cancer Diagnosis,"Researchers have developed computer-aided decision support systems for translational medicine that aim to objectively and efficiently diagnose cancer using histopathological images. However, the performance of such systems is confounded by nonbiological experimental variations or “batch effects” that can commonly occur in histopathological data, especially when images are acquired using different imaging devices and patient samples. This is even more problematic in large-scale studies in which cross-laboratory sharing of large volumes of data is necessary. Batch effects can change quantitative morphological image features and decrease the prediction performance. Using four batches of renal tumor images, we compare one image-level and five feature-level batch effect removal methods. Principal component variation analysis shows that batch is a large source of variance in image features. Results show that feature-level normalization methods reduce batch-contributed variance to almost zero. Moreover, feature-level normalization, especially ComBatN, improves cross-batch and combined-batch prediction performance. Compared to no normalization, ComBatN improves performance in 83% and 90% of cross-batch and combined-batch prediction models, respectively.",Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Cancer;Tumors;Predictive models;Educational institutions;Biomedical informatics;decision support systems;image representation;pathology,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2013.2276766
Toward Automatic Mitotic Cell Detection and Segmentation in Multispectral Histopathological Images,"The count of mitotic cells is a critical factor in most cancer grading systems. Extracting the mitotic cell from the histopathological image is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique for detecting and segmenting the mitotic cells in the high-resolution multispectral image. The proposed technique consists of three main modules: discriminative image generation, mitotic cell candidate detection and segmentation, and mitotic cell candidate classification. In the first module, a discriminative image is obtained by linear discriminant analysis using ten different spectral band images. A set of mitotic cell candidate regions is then detected and segmented by the Bayesian modeling and local-region threshold method. In the third module, a 226 dimension feature is extracted from the mitotic cell candidates and their surrounding regions. An imbalanced classification framework is then applied to perform the classification for the mitotic cell candidates in order to detect the real mitotic cells. The proposed technique has been evaluated on a publicly available dataset of 35 × 10 multispectral images, in which 224 mitotic cells are manually labeled by experts. The proposed technique is able to provide superior performance compared to the existing technique, 81.5% sensitivity rate and 33.9% precision rate in terms of detection performance, and 89.3% sensitivity rate and 87.5% precision rate in terms of segmentation performance.",Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Shape;Cancer;Microscopy;Image resolution;Linear discriminant analysis;Histopathological image analysis;image segmentation;object detection;pattern recognition,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2013.2277837
Local Object Patterns for the Representation and Classification of Colon Tissue Images,"This paper presents a new approach for the effective representation and classification of images of histopathological colon tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In this approach, we propose to decompose a tissue image into its histological components and introduce a set of new texture descriptors, which we call local object patterns, on these components to model their composition within a tissue. We define these descriptors using the idea of local binary patterns, which quantify a pixel by constructing a binary string based on relative intensities of its neighbors. However, as opposed to pixel-level local binary patterns, we define our local object pattern descriptors at the component level to quantify a component. To this end, we specify neighborhoods with different locality ranges and encode spatial arrangements of the components within the specified local neighborhoods by generating strings. We then extract our texture descriptors from these strings to characterize histological components and construct the bag-of-words representation of an image from the characterized components. Working on microscopic images of colon tissues, our experiments reveal that the use of these component-level texture descriptors results in higher classification accuracies than the previous textural approaches.",Accuracy;Histograms;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Clustering algorithms;Colon;Kernel;Classification;colon cancer;digital pathology;local patterns;texture;tissue image representation,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2013.2281335
Diagnosis of Human Bladder Cancer Cells at Different Stages Using Multispectral Imaging Microscopy,"Bladder cancer presents a spectrum of different diatheses. A precise assessment for individualized treatment depends on the accuracy of the initial diagnosis. Detection relies on comprehensive and accurate white light cystoscopy. White light cystoscopy has limitations in addition to its invasive nature and the potential risks related to the method. These limitations include difficulties in flat lesion detection, precise tumor delineation to enable complete resection, inflammation and malignancy differentiation, and grade and stage determination. The resolution of these problems depends on the surgeon's ability and experience with available technology for visualization and resection. In this study, we used multispectral imaging technology combined with phase contrast microscopy to analyze bladder cancer cells (BCCs) at various stages using a single-cell array chip. We found from the spectral characteristics of single cell that the cell spectra at the different cancer stages demonstrate a change in the cell's composition. We cultured 419 normal and diseased bladder cells. We used principal component analysis and a principal component score map to distinguish the different cancer stages. Diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of this method were 85.7% and 90.2% in 119 stage 0 (normal) cells, 84.3% and 90.8% in 79 stage 2 cancer cells, 87.6% and 92.4% in 151 stage 3 BCCs, and 85.3% and 91.2% in 70 stage 4 BCCs, respectively.",Cancer;Bladder;Arrays;Microscopy;Principal component analysis;Gray-scale;Image color analysis;Biomedical optical imaging;cancer cell detection;Image reconstruction techniques;multispectral imaging;multispectral imaging microscopy,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/JSTQE.2013.2279804
Model Based Inversion for Deriving Maps of Histological Parameters Characteristic of Cancer From Ex-Vivo Multispectral Images of the Colon,"A model-based inversion method was used to obtain quantitative estimates of histological parameters from multispectral images of the colon and to examine their potential for discriminating between normal and pathological tissues. Pixel-wise estimates of the mucosal blood volume fraction, density of the scattering particles and thickness were derived using a two-stage method. In the first (forward) stage reflectance spectra corresponding to given instances of the parameter values were computed using Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation through a multi-layered tissue. In the second (inversion) stage the parameter values were obtained via optimization using an iterated conditional modes algorithm based on Discrete Markov Random Fields. The method was validated on computer generated data contaminated with noise giving a mean normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) of 2.04. Validation on ex vivo images demonstrated that parametric maps show gross correspondence with histological features of mucosa characteristic of cancerous, precancerous and noncancerous colon lesions. The key signs of abnormality were shown to be the increase in the blood volume fraction and decrease in the density of scattering particles.",Colon;Scattering;Vectors;Reflectivity;Cancer;Blood;Optical imaging;Colon cancer;diffuse reflectance model;Discrete Markov Random Field (DMRF);inverse problems;Monte Carlo simulation;multispectral imaging,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2013.2290697
Optogenetic Brain Interfaces,"The brain is a large network of interconnected neurons where each cell functions as a nonlinear processing element. Unraveling the mysteries of information processing in the complex networks of the brain requires versatile neurostimulation and imaging techniques. Optogenetics is a new stimulation method which allows the activity of neurons to be modulated by light. For this purpose, the cell-types of interest are genetically targeted to produce light-sensitive proteins. Once these proteins are expressed, neural activity can be controlled by exposing the cells to light of appropriate wavelengths. Optogenetics provides a unique combination of features, including multimodal control over neural function and genetic targeting of specific cell-types. Together, these versatile features combine to a powerful experimental approach, suitable for the study of the circuitry of psychiatric and neurological disorders. The advent of optogenetics was followed by extensive research aimed to produce new lines of light-sensitive proteins and to develop new technologies: for example, to control the distribution of light inside the brain tissue or to combine optogenetics with other modalities including electrophysiology, electrocorticography, nonlinear microscopy, and functional magnetic resonance imaging.

A Novel Polar Space Random Field Model for the Detection of Glandular Structures,"In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect glandular structures in microscopic images of human tissue. We first convert the image from Cartesian space to polar space and then introduce a novel random field model to locate the possible boundary of a gland. Next, we develop a visual feature-based support vector regressor to verify if the detected contour corresponds to a true gland. And finally, we combine the outputs of the random field and the regressor to form the GlandVision algorithm for the detection of glandular structures. Our approach can not only detect the existence of the gland, but also can accurately locate it with pixel accuracy. In the experiments, we treat the task of detecting glandular structures as object (gland) detection and segmentation problems respectively. The results indicate that our new technique outperforms state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms in respective fields.",Glands;Image color analysis;Inference algorithms;Educational institutions;Image edge detection;Approximation algorithms;Image segmentation;Gland;polar space;random field,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2013.2296572
An Efficient Technique for Nuclei Segmentation Based on Ellipse Descriptor Analysis and Improved Seed Detection Algorithm,"In this paper, we propose an efficient method for segmenting cell nuclei in the skin histopathological images. The proposed technique consists of four modules. First, it separates the nuclei regions from the background with an adaptive threshold technique. Next, an elliptical descriptor is used to detect the isolated nuclei with elliptical shapes. This descriptor classifies the nuclei regions based on two ellipticity parameters. Nuclei clumps and nuclei with irregular shapes are then localized by an improved seed detection technique based on voting in the eroded nuclei regions. Finally, undivided nuclei regions are segmented by a marked watershed algorithm. Experimental results on 114 different image patches indicate that the proposed technique provides a superior performance in nuclei detection and segmentation.",Image segmentation;Shape;Informatics;Algorithm design and analysis;Kernel;Skin;Clustering algorithms;Ellipse descriptor;histopathological images;nuclei segmentation;seed detection;watershed algorithm,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2013.2297030
Images as Occlusions of Textures: A Framework for Segmentation,"We propose a new mathematical and algorithmic framework for unsupervised image segmentation, which is a critical step in a wide variety of image processing applications. We have found that most existing segmentation methods are not successful on histopathology images, which prompted us to investigate segmentation of a broader class of images, namely those without clear edges between the regions to be segmented. We model these images as occlusions of random images, which we call textures, and show that local histograms are a useful tool for segmenting them. Based on our theoretical results, we describe a flexible segmentation framework that draws on existing work on nonnegative matrix factorization and image deconvolution. Results on synthetic texture mosaics and real histology images show the promise of the method.",Image segmentation;Histograms;Image edge detection;Educational institutions;Microscopy;Deconvolution;Biomedical imaging;image segmentation;occlusion models;texture;local histograms;deconvolution;non-negative matrix factorization;Image segmentation;occlusion models;texture;local histograms;deconvolution;non-negative matrix factorization,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2014.2307475
Analysis and classification of hardwood species based on Coiflet DWT feature extraction and WEKA workbench,"The work proposes to introduce Coiflet discrete wavelet transform (DWT) family, to extract features of microscopic images of hardwood species in order to classify them into 25 different hardwood species. The images are being decomposed into 3 levels using Coiflet DWT family. Overall 48 features are obtained for each of the images with mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness extracted from each of the 12 subimages. Images of hardwood species have been classified by a pertinent application WEKA 3.7.9. Several WEKA classification algorithms have been tested on 48×500 feature matrix generated by the Coiflet DWT family, and it is found that multilayer perceptron classification algorithm belonging to function category of WEKA give classification accuracy of 92.20% for the feature matrix produced by “coif2” discrete wavelet transform.

Toward quantifying geometric microstructural differences between primary and secondary osteons via segmentation,"Osteo-histological studies reveal that bones remodel themselves by removing mature bone tissue (bone resorption) from the skeleton and by forming new bone tissue (ossification). In cortical bone, remodeling results in secondary systems replacing of bone that has existed previously (primary bone). In histology slides, secondary bone appears as osteons with central Haversian canals while primary bone appears as interstitial lamellae occupying spaces between osteons. Cement lines refer to the boundaries demarcating the osteons. Although primary and secondary osteons differ micro-structurally, disambiguating such differences in histological studies presents a challenge. This paper aims to quantify such differences using automated segmentation utilizing artificial intelligence and geometric attributes: e.g., area (size), and compactness (shape). Preliminary findings suggest that vascular channels within primary osteons tend to be far more numerous but of smaller sizes than in secondary osteons.",Irrigation;Bones;Image segmentation;Histograms;Standards;Shape;Microstructure,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2nd Middle East Conference on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/MECBME.2014.6783281
Detecting spongiosis in stained histopathological specimen using multispectral imaging and machine learning,"Pathologists spend nearly 80% of their time analysing pathological tissue samples. In addition, the diagnosis is subject to inter/intra-observer variability. Thus to increase productivity and repeatability, a new field known as Computational Pathology has emerged which combines the field of pathology with computer vision, pattern recognition and machine learning. This research develops a new computational pathology framework specifically to aid with detecting a condition known as spongiosis caused by Newcastle Disease Virus infection in poultry. It combines the use of multispectral imaging with feature extraction and classification to detect areas of spongiosis in tissue of infected poultry. The success of this framework is the first step towards a completely automated diagnosis tool for histopathology.",Feature extraction;Pathology;Support vector machines;Cameras;Multispectral imaging;Training;multispectral imaging;detection;machine learning;pattern recognition;computer vision,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS),10.1109/SAS.2014.6798945
A Unified Graphical Models Framework for Automated Mitosis Detection in Human Embryos,"Time lapse microscopy has emerged as an important modality for studying human embryo development, as mitosis events can provide insight into embryo health and fate. Mitosis detection can happen through tracking of embryonic cells (tracking based), or from low level image features and classifiers (tracking free). Tracking based approaches are challenged by high dimensional search space, weak features, outliers, missing data, multiple deformable targets, and weak motion model. Tracking free approaches are data driven and complement tracking based approaches. We pose mitosis detection as augmented simultaneous segmentation and classification in a conditional random field (CRF) framework that combines both approaches. It uses a rich set of discriminative features and their spatiotemporal context. It performs a dual pass approximate inference that addresses the high dimensionality of tracking and combines results from both components. For 312 clinical sequences we measured division events to within 30 min and observed an improvement of 25.6% and a 32.9% improvement over purely tracking based and tracking free approach respectively, and close to an order of magnitude over a traditional particle filter. While our work was motivated by human embryo development, it can be extended to other detection problems in image sequences of evolving cell populations.",Embryo;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Target tracking;Shape;Computational modeling;Data driven Monte Carlo;embryo tracking;graphical models;mitosis detection,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2014.2317836
"Local Optimization Based Segmentation of Spatially-Recurring, Multi-Region Objects With Part Configuration Constraints","Incorporating prior knowledge into image segmentation algorithms has proven useful for obtaining more accurate and plausible results. Two important constraints, containment and exclusion of regions, have gained attention in recent years mainly due to their descriptive power. In this paper, we augment the level set framework with the ability to handle these two intuitive geometric relationships, containment and exclusion, along with a distance constraint between boundaries of multi-region objects. Level set's important property of automatically handling topological changes of evolving contours/surfaces enables us to segment spatially-recurring objects (e.g., multiple instances of multi-region cells in a large microscopy image) while satisfying the two aforementioned constraints. In addition, the level set approach gives us a very simple and natural way to compute the distance between contours/surfaces and impose constraints on it. The downside, however, is a local optimization framework in which the final segmentation solution depends on the initialization. In fact, here, we sacrifice the optimizability (local instead of global solution) in exchange for lower space complexity (less memory usage) and faster runtime (especially for large microscopic images) as well as no grid artifacts. Nevertheless, the result from validating our method on several biomedical applications showed the utility and advantages of this augmented level set framework (even with rough initialization that is distant from the desired boundaries). We also compared our framework with its counterpart methods in the discrete domain and reported the pros and cons of each of these methods in terms of metrication error and efficiency in memory usage and runtime.",Image segmentation;Level set;Optimization;Biomedical imaging;Microscopy;Linear programming;Green products;Cardiac segmentation;containment;distance constraint;exclusion;geometrical constraints;left/right ventricle;level set;local optimization;microscopy;segmentation;spatially-recurring,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2014.2323074

Detection of centroblasts in H&E stained images of follicular lymphoma,"This paper presents a complete framework for automatic detection of malignant cells in microscopic images acquired from tissue biopsies of follicular lymphoma. After pre-processing to remove noise and suppress small details, images are segmented by using intensity thresholding, in order to detect the cell nuclei. Subsequently, touching cells are being separated using Expectation Maximization algorithm. Candidate centroblasts are then selected for classification by using size, shape and intensity histogram criteria.

Advanced methodology useful for exploring distortions in confocal microscopy medical images: Application to neurodegenerative pathology,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the nervous system and is characterized by a progressive loss of nerve cells. In order to understand and explore such pathology, confocal microscope images could be widely used because of their interesting high clarity in term of cell identification. In fact, confocal microscopy is a potential tool that enables real-time imaging of living tissue at high resolution and high contrast. However, in practical microscopy, aberration-free confocal imaging is rarely achieved. So, aberration corrected images of biological specimens show considerable improvement. Geometric aberrations are considered as the main sources of image degradation. The purpose of this project was to develop an advanced method that is able to estimate the distortion parameters and to test these parameters to correct image deformations. Such method was based on the adaptation of the Zhang's algorithm implemented in the OpenCV library in order to calibration of confocal microscopy images and results of simulation were interesting and promoting and could involve other research areas such as stitching confocal microscopic images and working in high resolution.",Microscopy;Calibration;Optical distortion;Diseases;Image reconstruction;Cameras;Channel estimation;Confocal microscope;spherical aberration;neurodegenerative diseases;calibration methods,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 1st International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Signal and Image Processing (ATSIP),10.1109/ATSIP.2014.6834617

Unsupervised feature learning for content-based histopathology image retrieval,"This paper proposes a strategy for content-based image retrieval, which combines unsupervised feature learning (UFL) with the classical bag-of-features (BOF) representation. In BOF, patches are usually represented using standard classical descriptors (i.e., SIFT, SURF, DCT, among others).We propose to use UFL to learn the patch representation itself. This is achieved by applying a topographic UFL method, which automatically learns visual invariance properties of color, scale and rotation from an image collection. The learned image representation is used as input for a multimodal latent semantic indexing system, which enriches the visual representation with semantics from image annotations. The overall strategy is evaluated in a particular histopathology image collection retrieval task, showing that the learned representation has a positive impact in retrieval performance for this particular task.",Visualization;Semantics;Discrete cosine transforms;Indexing;Matrix decomposition;Image retrieval;Feature extraction;Unsupervised Feature Learning;Content-Based Image Retrieval;Multimodal Semantic Indexing,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 12th International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing (CBMI),10.1109/CBMI.2014.6849815

As traffic variables have many fluctuations which are considered as noisy signals, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as used for de-noising and also extracting features from noisy signals. It is found that the proposed system that uses DWT can give higher detection rate when compared with the system without DWT. Furthermore, the majority voting is also applied to the outputs of FIS in order to increase detection rate. Finally, based on simulation results, the performance of the proposed detection system for lane-blocking traffic incidents will be shown.",Discrete wavelet transforms;Filter banks;Approximation methods;Fuzzy logic;Feature extraction;Fluctuations;Anomaly detection;traffic incident detection;fuzzy logic;discrete wavelet transform (DWT);intelligent transpostation systems (ITS),INPROCEEDINGS,2014,"2014 11th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)",10.1109/ECTICon.2014.6839881
Morphological analysis of activated sludge flocs and filaments,"Purification of waste water is commonly done using the activated sludge process. The ratio of the activated sludge flocs and filamentous bacteria play a key role in the purification process of waste water. The sludge bulking or filamentous bulking is a common problem in activated sludge plants that prevents flocs to settle down. Digital imaging techniques can play an important role in monitoring activated sludge flocs and filaments in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs).

Fractal and image analysis of cytoskeletal changes in tumour cells due to the effects of maspin,"Maspin (SERPINB5) is a type II metastasis suppressor that influences multiple cellular functions. To date, maspin has been shown to increase adhesion and apoptosis and to decrease cell migration, proliferation, invasion and metastases in tumour malignancy. At the subcellular level, maspin influences morphological changes in the cell cytoskeleton which regulates complex biological processes including cell migration, cell adhesion and EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition). Here non-Euclidian fractal and image analyses have been applied to measure changes in the actin cytoskeleton using confocal microscopy images to confirm the effects of maspin. Results show that maspin contributes to maintaining the regular epithelial like shape, increases cell-cell adhesion and restricts tumour cells from showing the pre-migration and EMT characteristics. Characterization of these changes in the actin cytoskeleton using microscopic image analysis will establish maspin as a potential prognostic marker in future.",Fractals;Adhesives;Shape;Tumors;Microscopy;Morphology;Cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI),10.1109/BHI.2014.6864341
Multivariate statistical analysis for dermatological disease diagnosis,"The differential diagnosis of some erythemato-squamous diseases is a major problem in dermatology.

Further complicating diagnosis, they all share clinical features, with very few differences. Although biopsies could help physicians, these diseases also share many histopathological features. In this context, this research applies a multivariate statistical analysis to explore the Dermatology Data Set (available in the UCI data repository) and construct a classifier, based on the clinical features, as an aid to the medical diagnosis of erythemato-squamous dermatological diseases. The research results provide enhanced knowledge that can help to enrich dermatological diagnoses made by doctors. Also, the classifier developed using the Linear Discriminant Analysis obtains a high mean accuracy rate in relation to the 6 diseases (83.73% correct classifications).

Automated nuclei clump splitting by combining local concavity orientation and graph partitioning,"Automated clump decomposition is essential for single cell based analysis of fluorescent microscopy images. This paper presents a new method for automatically splitting clumps of cell nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images. Nuclei are first segmented using histogram concavity analysis. Clumps of nuclei are detected by fitting an ellipse to the segmented objects and examining objects where the fitted ellipse does not overlap accurately with the segmented object. These clumps are then further processed to find concave points on the object boundaries. The orientation of the detected concavities is subsequently calculated based on the local shape of the object border. Finally, a graph segmentation based approach is used to pair concavities that represent best candidates for splitting touching nuclei based on properties derived from the local concavity properties. This approach was validated by manual inspection and has shown promising results in the high throughput analysis of HeLa cell images.",Image segmentation;Parkinson's disease;Microscopy;Vectors;Histograms;Shape;Throughput,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI),10.1109/BHI.2014.6864390

Learning and visualizing statistical relationships between protein distributions from microscopy images,"Multichannel microscopy has emerged as a technique for imaging multiple targets (molecules, protein distributions, etc.) simultaneously. Discovering the relative changes in these targets (i.e. distribution of different proteins) is fundamental for understanding cell structure and function. We describe a new method for quantifying and visualizing relationships between multiple targets, from a set of segmented multichannel cells. The method is based on combining the canonical correlation analysis technique with a framework for analyzing images based on the concept of optimal mass transportation. We apply the method towards understanding chromatin distribution in cancer nuclei as a function of nuclear envelope shape. We also show that sub cellular distribution of mitochondria can be used to predict the sub cellular localization of actin fibers in yeast cells. Finally, we also describe the application of the method towards understanding relationships between nuclear and cellular shapes in 2D HeLa cells. We believe that the method could serve as a general tool for mining relationships between different sub cellular protein/molecule distributions as well as organelle shapes.",Proteins;Correlation;Shape;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Protein engineering;subcellular localization;protein distributions;organelle morphology;canonical correlation analysis;optimal transport,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867888
Mining histopathological images via hashing-based scalable image retrieval,"Automatic analysis of histopathological images has been widely investigated using computational image processing and machine learning techniques. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems and content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems have been successfully developed for diagnosis, disease detection, and decision support in this area. In this paper, we focus on a scalable image retrieval method with high-dimensional features for the analysis of histopathology images. Specifically, we present a kernelized and supervised hashing method. With a small amount of supervised information, our method can compress a 10,000-dimensional image feature vector into only tens of binary bits with informative signatures preserved, and these binary codes are then indexed into a hash table that enables real-time retrieval. We validate the hashing-based image retrieval framework on several thousands of images of breast microscopic tissues for both image classification (i.e., benign vs. actionable categorization) and retrieval. Our framework achieves high search accuracy and promising computational efficiency, comparing favorably with other commonly used methods.",Image retrieval;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Cancer;Support vector machines;Kernel;Binary codes;histopathological image analysis;breast lesion;CBIR;scalable image retrieval;hashing,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6868069
Understanding embryonic heart morphogenesis through automatic segmentation and confocal imaging with optical clearing,"Embryonic heart morphogenesis (EHM) is a developmental process where the heart transforms from a single tube into a four-chambered pump. It is of great biological and clinical interest, but is still poorly understood for two main reasons. On one hand, the existing imaging modalities for investigating EHM suffered from either limited penetration depth or limited spatial resolution. On the other hand, current works typically adopted manual segmentation, which was tedious, subjective and time-consuming considering the complexity of developing heart geometry and the large size of images. In this paper, we propose to utilize confocal microscopy imaging with tissue optical clearing technique to image the heart at different stages of development for EHM study. This imaging method is able to produce high spatial resolution images and achieve high penetration depth. Furthermore, we propose a novel convex active contour model for automatic image segmentation. The model has the ability of dealing with intensity fall-off the depth which is characterized by confocal microscopy images. We scan and segment embryonic quail hearts from day 6 to day 14 of incubation. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed segmentation method and the usefulness of this imaging data, and provide us an insight view of early heart development.",Heart;Image segmentation;Manuals;Microscopy;Optical imaging;Embryonic heart morphogenesis;confocal imaging;optical clearing;image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6868116
Touching adipocyte cells decomposition using combinatorial optimization,"Cell detection plays a significant role in automated biomedical image analysis. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate detection due to dense crowding/touching of cells. In this paper, we propose a robust decomposition algorithm for cell detection on adipocyte images. It formulates the decomposition into a cut selection problem using the polygon triangulation approximation and a specific-defined concavity measurement, and utilizes combinatorial optimization to select the optimal cuts. The proposed algorithm can effectively handle contour noises, large shape variance and size difference. In addition, the decomposition seeds preserve original cell shapes to facilitate the subsequent segmentation. The algorithm is well tested with 231 adipocyte microscopic image patches, which contain 2–17 touching cells with a variety of morphological complexity. The comparative experiments with the recent state of the arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.",Shape;Robustness;Image segmentation;Approximation algorithms;Measurement;Accuracy;Optimization,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6868125
Spectral band selection for mitosis detection in histopathology,"This study aims at evaluating the accuracy of mitosis detection on multispectral histopathological images by developing a solution specifically designed to take advantage of multi-spectral information. The proposed framework includes a selection of spectral bands and focal plane, detection of candidate mitotic regions, computation of morphological & mul-tispectral statistical features (MMSF) and study of different state-of-the-art classification methods for mitosis classification. This framework achieved 74% TPR, 76% PPV and 74% F-Measure on MITOS dataset. Our results indicate that selected multispectral bands contain discriminant information for mitotic figures, being therefore a very promising exploration area to improve the quality of the diagnosis assistance in histopathology.",Absorption;Redundancy;Breast cancer;Frequency modulation;Feature extraction;Mutual information;histopathology;multispectral images;spectral band selection;mitosis detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6868110
Multi-scale non-local means with shape prior for enhancement of cell membrane images,"Light sheet microscopy allows rapid optical sectioning of whole chicken embryos during early development, visualizing cells through transgenic expression of a fluorescent cell membrane label. Low signal-to-noise ratios and large variability in intensity make segmentation of these images difficult, often resulting in discontinuous cell edges. We propose a multi-scale non-local means with shape prior (MS-NLM-SP) method for image enhancement, which takes into account cell-specific characteristics, such as size, geometry, and periodicity. Investigating theoretical connections between our approach and anisotropic diffusion reveals that the first step, detail-enhanced multi-scale representation, corresponds to selective backward diffusion, while the second step of MS-NLM-SP resembles anisotropic forward diffusion. Experimental results show that incorporating cell-specific features into non-local image denoising methods improves subsequent segmentation.",Shape;Image segmentation;Laplace equations;Noise;Image edge detection;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Filtering;Image enhancement;non-local means;multi-scale representation;shape prior;cell membrane,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867916
SLT-LoG: A vesicle segmentation method with automatic scale selection and local thresholding applied to TIRF microscopy,"Accurately detecting cellular structures in fluorescence microscopy is of primary interest for further quantitative analysis such as counting, tracking or classification. We aim at segmenting vesicles in TIRF images. The optimal segmentation scale is automatically selected, relying on a multiscale feature detection stage, and the segmentation consists in thresholding the Laplacian of Gaussian of the intensity image. In contrast to other methods, the threshold is locally adapted, resulting in better detection rates for complex images. Our method is mostly on par with machine learning-based techniques, while offering lower computation time and requiring no prior training. It is very competitive with existing unsupervised detection algorithms.",Signal to noise ratio;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Laplace equations;Estimation;Transforms,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867926

Automatic simultaneous segmentation and fast registration of histological images,"We describe an automatic method for fast registration of images with very different appearances. The images are jointly segmented into a small number of classes, the segmented images are registered, and the process is repeated. The segmentation calculates feature vectors on superpixels and then it finds a softmax classifier maximizing mutual information between class labels in the two images. For speed, the registration considers a sparse set of rectangular neighborhoods on the interfaces between classes. A triangulation is created with spatial regularization handled by pairwise spring-like terms on the edges. The optimal transformation is found globally using loopy belief propagation. Multiresolution helps to improve speed and robustness. Our main application is registering stained histological slices, which are large and differ both in the local and global appearance. We show that our method has comparable accuracy to standard pixel-based registration, while being faster and more general.",Image segmentation;Image registration;Belief propagation;Standards;Mutual information;Biomedical imaging;Vectors;image registration;image segmentation;mutual information;loopy belief propagation,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867985
Cell type-independent mitosis event detection via hidden-state conditional neural fields,"This paper proposes a cell type-independent mitosis event detection method based on hidden-state conditional neural fields in time-lapse phase contrast microscopy sequences of stem cell populations. This method proceeds through three steps. First, we apply the imaging model-based microscopy image segmentation method and volumetric region growing to extract candidate sequences. Then, we extract the GIST feature of each frame within a candidate sequence for visual representation. Finally, a hidden-state conditional neural field classifier is trained to classify each candidate as mitosis or not. The main contribution is that the proposed method can jointly realize non-linear feature learning for different types of cells and temporal dynamic modeling of mitotic progression. The comparison experiments demonstrated the proposed method can benefit the detection of cell type-independent mitosis.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Hidden Markov models;Educational institutions;Logic gates;Visualization;Hidden conditional neural fields;mitosis;phase contrast microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867849
Dynamic morphology-based characterization of stem cells enabled by texture-based pattern recognition from phase-contrast images,"The increased use of stem cells to study disease states in vitro has created a need for tools that provide automated, non-invasive, and objective characterization of cell cultures. In this work, we address this need by developing a novel framework for stem cell assessment using time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy and automated texture-based analysis of images. We capture and quantify morphological changes during stem cell colony growth by segmenting each image of the time-lapse sequence into five distinct classes of cells. We apply our automated classification to enable non-invasive estimation of cell doubling time, and demonstrate applications of the presented framework for quantitative assessment of cell culture conditions.",Stem cells;Media;Compaction;Image segmentation;Stress;Support vector machines;Histograms,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867813
A unified graphical models framework for automated human embryo tracking in time lapse microscopy,"Time lapse microscopy has emerged as an important modality for studying early human embryo development. Detection of certain events can provide insight into embryo health and fate. Embryo tracking is challenged by a high dimensional search space, weak features, outliers, occlusions, missing data, multiple interacting deformable targets, changing topology, and a weak motion model. We address these with a data driven approach that uses a rich set of discriminative image and geometric features and their spatiotemporal context. We pose the mitosis detection problem as augmented simultaneous segmentation and classification in a conditional random field framework that combines tracking based and tracking free elements. For 275 clinical image sequences we measured division events during the first 48 hours of embryo development to within 30 minutes resulting in an improvement of 24.2% over a tracking-based approach and a 35.7% improvement over a tracking-free approach, and more than an order of magnitude improvement over a traditional particle filter, demonstrating the success of our framework.",Embryo;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Standards;Shape;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867872
Digital pathology: Multiple instance learning can detect Barrett's cancer,"We study diagnosis of Barrett's cancer from hematoxylin & eosin (H & E) stained histopathological biopsy images using multiple instance learning (MIL). We partition tissue cores into rectangular patches, and construct a feature vector consisting of a large set of cell-level and patch-level features for each patch. In MIL terms, we treat each tissue core as a bag (group of instances with a single group-level ground-truth label) and each patch an instance. After a benchmarking study on several MIL approaches, we find that a graph-based MIL algorithm, mi-Graph [1], gives the best performance (87% accuracy, 0.93 AUC), due to its inherent suitability to bags with spatially-correlated instances. In patch-level diagnosis, we reach 82% accuracy and 0.89 AUC using Bayesian logistic regression. We also pursue a study on feature importance, which shows that patch-level color and texture features and cell-level features all have significant contribution to prediction.",Cancer;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Kernel;Cancer diagnosis;multiple instance learning;histopathological tissue imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2014.6868127
Automatic Segmentation of Mitochondria in EM Data Using Pairwise Affinity Factorization and Graph-Based Contour Searching,"In this paper, we investigate the segmentation of closed contours in subcellular data using a framework that primarily combines the pairwise affinity grouping principles with a graph partitioning contour searching approach. One salient problem that precluded the application of these methods to large scale segmentation problems is the onerous computational complexity required to generate comprehensive representations that include all pairwise relationships between all pixels in the input data. To compensate for this problem, a practical solution is to reduce the complexity of the input data by applying an over-segmentation technique prior to the application of the computationally demanding strands of the segmentation process. This approach opens the opportunity to build specific shape and intensity models that can be successfully employed to extract the salient structures in the input image which are further processed to identify the cycles in an undirected graph. The proposed framework has been applied to the segmentation of mitochondria membranes in electron microscopy data which are characterized by low contrast and low signal-to-noise ratio. The algorithm has been quantitatively evaluated using two datasets where the segmentation results have been compared with the corresponding manual annotations. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been measured using standard metrics, such as precision and recall, and the experimental results indicate a high level of segmentation accuracy.",Image segmentation;Shape;Clustering algorithms;Noise;Partitioning algorithms;Complexity theory;Coherence;Mitochondria segmentation;electron microscopy;affinity models;spectral clustering and graph searching,ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2014.2347240

"Comparative Performance Analysis of Intel (R) Xeon Phi (TM), GPU, and CPU: A Case Study from Microscopy Image Analysis","We study and characterize the performance of operations in an important class of applications on GPUs and Many Integrated Core (MIC) architectures. Our work is motivated by applications that analyze low-dimensional spatial datasets captured by high resolution sensors, such as image datasets obtained from whole slide tissue specimens using microscopy scanners. Common operations in these applications involve the detection and extraction of objects (object segmentation), the computation of features of each extracted object (feature computation), and characterization of objects based on these features (object classification). In this work, we have identify the data access and computation patterns of operations in the object segmentation and feature computation categories. We systematically implement and evaluate the performance of these operations on modern CPUs, GPUs, and MIC systems for a microscopy image analysis application. Our results show that the performance on a MIC of operations that perform regular data access is comparable or sometimes better than that on a GPU. On the other hand, GPUs are significantly more efficient than MICs for operations that access data irregularly. This is a result of the low performance of MICs when it comes to random data access. We also have examined the coordinated use of MICs and CPUs. Our experiments show that using a performance aware task strategy for scheduling application operations improves performance about 1.29× over a first-come-first-served strategy. This allows applications to obtain high performance efficiency on CPU-MIC systems - the example application attained an efficiency of 84% on 192 nodes (3072 CPU cores and 192 MICs).",Microwave integrated circuits;Instruction sets;Graphics processing units;Vegetation;Microscopy;Image analysis;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 28th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium,10.1109/IPDPS.2014.111
Modeling and characterizing collagen fiber bundles,"Collagen fibers are prominent constituents of many soft tissues. The fibers are able to carry load along their fiber axis, and, therefore, their structural arrangement renders the mechanical behavior of biological tissue anisotropic. In some tissues, e.g., blood vessels, tendons and ligaments, the fibers form fiber bundles. Structure-based biomechanical models of soft tissues strongly rely on a clear understanding of the underlying collagen fiber bundle structure and require precise quantitative structural information. The paper presents a novel fiber bundle model that satisfactorily explains the observed bundle structure and reveals meaningful parameters for bundle characterization. The model is capable of describing a wide variety of natural bundle structures. It is shown that the identified bundle parameters can be extracted from real histological images using computer vision algorithms. The generative nature of the model allows the creation of artificial fiber bundle images with characteristics very similar to real images.",Biological system modeling;Biological tissues;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging;Tendons;Ligaments;Data mining;Computer vision;Character generation,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,"3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro, 2006.",10.1109/ISBI.2006.1625159
Microwave drilling of bones,"This paper presents a feasibility study of drilling in fresh wet bone tissue in vitro using the microwave drill method [Derby et ab, 2002], toward testing its applicability in orthopaedic surgery. The microwave drill uses a near-field focused energy (typically, power under /spl sim/200 W at 2.45-GHz frequency) in order to penetrate bone in a drilling speed of /spl sim/1 mm/s. The effect of microwave drilling on mechanical properties of whole ovine tibial and chicken femoral bones drilled in vitro was studied using three-point-bending strength and fatigue tests. Properties were compared to those of geometrically similar bones that were equivalently drilled using the currently accepted mechanical rotary drilling method. Strength of mid-shaft, elastic moduli, and cycles to failure in fatigue were statistically indistinguishable between specimen groups assigned for microwave and mechanical drilling. Carbonized margins around the microwave-drilled hole were /spl sim/15% the hole diameter. Optical and scanning electron microscopy studies showed that the microwave drill produces substantially smoother holes in cortical bone than those produced by a mechanical drill. The hot spot produced by the microwave drill has the potential for overcoming two major problems presently associated with mechanical drilling in cortical and trabecular bone during orthopaedic surgeries: formation of debris and rupture of bone vasculature during drilling.",Drilling;Orthopedic surgery;In vitro;Testing;Mechanical factors;Fatigue;Optical microscopy;Bone tissue;Microwave theory and techniques;Frequency;Carbonization;mechanical properties;orthopaedic surgery;thermal damage,ARTICLE,2006,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2006.873562
Adaptive scanning optical microscope (ASOM) for large workspace micro-robotic applications,"Manipulation and assembly tasks associated with micro-systems, biotechnology, and product miniaturization demand that robots increasingly operate at microscopic dimensions. This paper discusses a new microscope design, called the adaptive scanning optical microscope (ASOM), that is particularly suitable for observing robotic activities at the micron scale. The ASOM combines a custom designed scanner lens, high speed steering mirror, and MEMS deformable mirror to offer the advantages of a greatly expanded field of view, rapid image acquisition, and no agitation to the workspace or specimen. After briefly discussing the challenges of micro assembly and micro manipulation, we present the ASOM theory of operation and include simulated performance results. A low cost proof-of-concept experimental prototype of the ASOM is then described and used to demonstrate shape optimization of the MEMS deformable mirror for different field positions.

Gaussian mixture and Markov models for cell-phase classification in microscopic imaging,"Studies of drug effects on cancer cells are performed through measuring cell cycle progression such as inter phase, prophase, metaphase and anaphase in individual cells. Such studies require the processing and analysis of huge amounts of image data. Manual image analysis is very time consuming thus costly, potentially inaccurate and poorly reproducible. Stages of an automated cellular imaging analysis consist of segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and tracking of individual cells in a dynamic cellular population.

"A spatiotemporal, patient individualized simulation model of solid tumor response to chemotherapy in vivo: the paradigm of glioblastoma multiforme treated by temozolomide","A novel four-dimensional, patient-specific Monte Carlo simulation model of solid tumor response to chemotherapeutic treatment in vivo is presented. The special case of glioblastoma multiforme treated by temozolomide is addressed as a simulation paradigm. Nevertheless, a considerable number of the involved algorithms are generally applicable. The model is based on the patient's imaging, histopathologic and genetic data. For a given drug administration schedule lying within acceptable toxicity boundaries, the concentration of the prodrug and its metabolites within the tumor is calculated as a function of time based on the drug pharamacokinetics. A discretization mesh is superimposed upon the anatomical region of interest and within each geometrical cell of the mesh the most prominent biological ""laws"" (cell cycling, necrosis, apoptosis, mechanical restrictions, etc.) are applied. The biological cell fates are predicted based on the drug pharmacodynamics. The outcome of the simulation is a prediction of the spatiotemporal activity of the entire tumor and is virtual reality visualized. A good qualitative agreement of the model's predictions with clinical experience supports the applicability of the approach.

Inspecting Ingredients of Starches in Starch-Noodle based on Image Processing and Pattern Recognition,"Inspecting what sort of starch in commercial starchnoodles is important to international trade, food safety and protecting consumer benefit. At present, the inspection of components of starches in starch-noodle mainly relies on sensory perception, and which is fallibility or trustless. Because the microstructure pattern of starches in starchnoodles depends mainly on a kind or blend of starches from which the starch-noodle was made, this paper presents an approach to classify the starch-noodles by using computer system automatically based on recognizing the microstructure pattern of the starches and components in starch-noodle. The method consists of three step: 1) take the micrograph of starch-noodles with scanning electron microscopy and preprocessing. 2) extract features of fractal geometry and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence from micrograph. 3) distinguish a sort of starch-noodles by using these combined features as input vector of artificial neural networks. The experiments has been conducted with starch-noodles of mungbean blending pachyrhizus, and the experimental results show that the method is practicable and effective.",Image processing;Pattern recognition;Microstructure;International trade;Safety;Protection;Inspection;Scanning electron microscopy;Data preprocessing;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06),10.1109/ICPR.2006.714
A Robust Multi-Orientation Gabor Based System for Discriminating Touching White and Red Cells in Microscopic Blood Image,"In many image analysis systems, segmentation is the first step. So its accuracy impacts on whole system efficiency. In normal human blood microscopic image, which contains white and red blood cells, because of high accumulation of red cells, there exist touch and overlap between these cells. They are two difficult issues in image segmentation which common segmentation algorithms cannot overcome them. Red cell has fine texture while white cell has coarse one, so texture is a very good discriminating feature for segmentation of blood cells. Gabor filters are one of the most powerful methods for texture segmentation. Blood image don't have regular textures. Common Gabor filter banks are suitable for regular texture segmentation. So we have employed a Gabor filter bank including many orientations and few frequencies in combination with sigmoid function for blood image segmentation. Results show that our approach is efficient",Robustness;Cells (biology);Microscopy;Image segmentation;Humans;Gabor filters;White blood cells;Image color analysis;Image texture analysis;Laboratories,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,2006 2nd International Conference on Information & Communication Technologies,10.1109/ICTTA.2006.1684534
Selective Deposition of Hafnium Oxide Nanothin Films on OTS Patterned Si(100) Substrates by Metal–Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition,"Soft lithography is a method for the manufacture of micro/nano size patterns and structures by using organic materials without the use of high energy. In particular, microcontact printing (muCP) is a very convenient and nonphotolithographic technique that can generate patterned features of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). In this study, we carried out the selective deposition of HfO2 nano-thin films on Si(100) substrates by combination of muCP using octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Single molecular precursor of Hf(OtBu) 4 was used for the growth of HfO2 nano-films, and the deposition was carried out between 150degC and 400degC at a pressure of 3times10-2 torr. The as-grown films were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) measurement. It is expected that the combination of muCP of SAM and MOCVD is a better method for fabricating the HfO 2 thin films between micro and nano sizes",Hafnium oxide;Chemical vapor deposition;Optical microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy;Soft lithography;MOCVD;Optical films;Photoelectron microscopy;Capacitance-voltage characteristics;Manufacturing;HFO$_2$ thin film;metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD);microcontact printing;selective growth,ARTICLE,2006,IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology,10.1109/TNANO.2006.881274
Visualization and Analysis of Large Data Collections: a Case Study Applied to Confocal Microscopy Data,"In this paper we propose an approach in which interactive visualization and analysis are combined with batch tools for the processing of large data collections. Large and heterogeneous data collections are difficult to analyze and pose specific problems to interactive visualization. Application of the traditional interactive processing and visualization approaches as well as batch processing encounter considerable drawbacks for such large and heterogeneous data collections due to the amount and type of data. Computing resources are not sufficient for interactive exploration of the data and automated analysis has the disadvantage that the user has only limited control and feedback on the analysis process. In our approach, an analysis procedure with features and attributes of interest for the analysis is defined interactively. This procedure is used for offline processing of large collections of data sets. The results of the batch process along with ""visual summaries"" are used for further analysis. Visualization is not only used for the presentation of the result, but also as a tool to monitor the validity and quality of the operations performed during the batch process. Operations such as feature extraction and attribute calculation of the collected data sets are validated by visual inspection. This approach is illustrated by an extensive case study, in which a collection of confocal microscopy data sets is analyzed",Data visualization;Data analysis;Microscopy;Testing;Biomedical measurements;Automatic control;Feedback;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Inspection;Biomedical visualization;features in volume data sets;large data set visualization.

"Automated Classification of Human Histological Images, A Multiple-Instance Learning Approach","In this paper, we apply a multiple-instance learning (MIL) method, MILES (multiple-instance learning via embedded instance selection), to human histological image classification. MILES converts a MIL problem to a supervised learning problem by an instance-based feature mapping. 1-norm SVM is then adopted to select features and construct a classifier simultaneously. MILES identifies the sub-images that reflect underlying category concepts, and use them for classification. Experimental validation is provided based on images from different organs and parts of the body.

Study on the extraction method of tool wear symptom based on wavelet packet analysis,"With the emergence of PCBN cutting tools, hard turning technology was used more and more widely in the difficult-to-cut materials. Therefore, it is particularly important to study the tool wear mechanism of ultrasonic hard cutting and intelligent monitoring technology of tool wear. Then, a multisignal intelligent monitoring test platform of tool wear was established through Kistler9257B resistance dynamometer, the INV306DF east vibration isolation system and Japan Roy keane and high-speed microscopic photography system. The test was designed about GCr15 hardened bearing steel machined by PCBN under ultrasonic vibration and tool wear mechanism was analyzed. A special characterization and the influence of cutting conditions on tool wear are obtained under the conditions of ultrasonic cutting. Because the sensor signal information Obtained from can't be directly used to identify the tool wear state a variety of signals collected in different processing time were analyzed and disposed in this paper.

Density analysis of collagen fibers based on enhanced frangi filter in Second Harmonic Generation virtual biopsy images,"The density of collagen fibers are automatically evaluated by the proposed algorithm based on enhanced Frangi filter. In optical virtual biopsy, Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy has been developed and applied to observe collagen fibers in the dermal layer of the human skin. The density of collagen fibers is a feature to describe the condition of collagen fibers which can provide indicator for the early pathological diagnosis and aging characteristic in SHG images.

Classification of Histology Sections via Multispectral Convolutional Sparse Coding,"Image-based classification of histology sections plays an important role in predicting clinical outcomes. However this task is very challenging due to the presence of large technical variations (e.g., fixation, staining) and biological heterogeneities (e.g., cell type, cell state). In the field of biomedical imaging, for the purposes of visualization and/or quantification, different stains are typically used for different targets of interest (e.g., cellular/subcellular events), which generates multi-spectrum data (images) through various types of microscopes and, as a result, provides the possibility of learning biological-component-specific features by exploiting multispectral information. We propose a multispectral feature learning model that automatically learns a set of convolution filter banks from separate spectra to efficiently discover the intrinsic tissue morphometric signatures, based on convolutional sparse coding (CSC). The learned feature representations are then aggregated through the spatial pyramid matching framework (SPM) and finally classified using a linear SVM. The proposed system has been evaluated using two large-scale tumor cohorts, collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Experimental results show that the proposed model 1) outperforms systems utilizing sparse coding for unsupervised feature learning (e.g., PSDSPM [5]), 2) is competitive with systems built upon features with biological prior knowledge (e.g., SMLSPM [4]).",Feature extraction;Convolutional codes;Kernel;Encoding;Histograms;Tumors;Training,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/CVPR.2014.394
Novel feature extraction methodology based on histopathalogical images and subsequent classification by support vector machine,"A novel methodology for automatic feature extraction from histo-pathological images and subsequent classification is presented. The proposed automated system use a number of features extracted from images of skin lesions through image processing techniques which consisted of a spatially winner and adaptive median filter then applied Gabor filter bank to improve diagnostic accuracy. Histogram equalization to enhance the contrast of the images prior to segmentation is used. The extracted features are reduced by using sequential feature selection and finally, the obtained statistics are fed to a support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier to diagnose skin biopsies from patients as either malignant melanoma or benign nevi. The obtained classification accuracies show better performance in comparison to similar approaches for feature extraction. The proposed system is able to achieve a good result with classification accuracy of (81)%, sensitivity of(76)% and specificity of (100)%and 17 times faster than some of the reported results.",Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Time-frequency analysis;Frequency locked loops;Sensitivity;lesion;histo-pathological images;CAD;winner;adaptive median filter (AMF);Gabor filter bank;Histogram Equalization;Sobel;Thresholding;sequential feature selection (SFS);support vector machine (SVM),INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 World Symposium on Computer Applications & Research (WSCAR),10.1109/WSCAR.2014.6916803
Cell segmentation and NC ratio analysis for biopsy images using marker controlled watershed algorithm,"Segmentation of cell nuclei and cytoplasm is an important task in most of the medical images. Microscopic cell image analysis is the fundamental tool for biological research. Visual inspection of cellular images is often insufficient to detect and describe the important changes in cellular morphology. In this paper, the cell segmentation approach uses the marker controlled watershed based approach, which is used to avoid over segmentation. The main goal of watershed transform is to distinguish the regional minima of original images, which are the nuclei's region and it integrates the convergence index filter to segment the region of cell's cytoplasm. This cell segmentation approach contributes the way for the analysis of nuclear-to cytoplasm ratio (NC ratio), which is significant to distinguish or detecting the prior symptoms of diseases like cancer based on normal and abnormal NC ratios.",Image segmentation;Convergence;Transforms;Indexes;Vectors;Shape;Cancer;Cell segmentation;marker controlled watershed;convergence index filter;nucleus to cytoplasm ratio (NC ratio),INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE),10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6921396
Contrast-ultrasound dispersion imaging of cancer neovascularization by mutual-information analysis,"Being an established marker for cancer growth, neovascularization is probed by several approaches with the aim of cancer imaging. Recently, analysis of the dispersion kinetics of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) has been proposed as a promising approach for localizing neovascularization in prostate cancer. Determined by multipath trajectories through the microvasculature, dispersion enables characterization of the microvascular architecture and, therefore, localization of cancer neovascularization. Analysis of the spatiotemporal similarity among indicator dilution curves (IDCs) measured at each pixel by dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging has been proposed to assess the local dispersion kinetics of UCAs. Only linear similarity measures, such as temporal correlation or spectral coherence, have been used up until now. Here we investigate the use of nonlinear similarity measures by estimation of the statistical dependency between IDCs. In particular, dispersion maps are generated by estimation of the mutual information between IDCs. The method is tested for prostate cancer localization and the results compared with the histology results in 15 patients referred for radical prostatectomy because of biopsy-proven prostate cancer. With sensitivity and specificity equal to 84% and 85%, respectively, and receiver operating characteristic curve area equal to 0.92, our results outperformed those obtained by any other parameter, motivating further validation with a larger dataset and with other types of cancer.",Dispersion;Ultrasonic imaging;Mutual information;Imaging;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Prostate cancer;Ultrasound contrast agents;dispersion;perfusion;cancer;angiogenesis;dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium,10.1109/ULTSYM.2014.0282
Optic and acoustic detection of laser-induced optical breakdown in DDFP,"Laser induced optical breakdown (LIOB) or laser induced cavitation (LIC) in water has been investigated widely. Several patterns of LIC bubble are involved. However, LIOB in water needs relatively high laser intensity and extremely short pulse length in femtosecond. In the study, low intensity laser in nanoseconds was utilized in the LIOB in dodecafluoropentane (DDFP), and then the optical and acoustic detection were performed to reveal the characteristics of bubble dynamics and acoustic signal emitted from the cavitation site. LIOB was realized in the confocal system of laser, acoustic detection and microscopic imaging. A single pulse laser of 521 nm wavelength, with a 3-5 ns pulse width and average power of 50 μJ, was employed in the experiment after being focused on 200μm cellulose tube by 40× and 0.8 numerical aperture objective lens. High speed camera was used to acquire the images during LIOB, bubble formation and collapse. Passive acoustic detection (PCD) was performed by 10 MHz focused transducer connected via an amplifier to a high speed digitizer. The spectrum analysis and joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA) were performed to show the characteristics of LIOB in DDFP. Comparing to LIOB in water, focused laser at lower intensity could induce optical breakdown in DDFP liquid with longer bubble life time. Three patterns were observed and the difference is closely related with the circumstance temperature. The life time of bubbles correspond to their maximum radius. The original temperature is closely related with the cavitation forming time. In acoustic detection, significant RF signal were recorded by PCD when LIOB occurred. Its spectrum analysis and joint time-frequency analysis revealed LIOB happened in the duration of 3 μs, and the spectrum of LIOB signal was mainly distributed between 0-12MHz, with characteristics of specific frequencies of n×f. These characteristics of LIOB bubble in DDFP gives information for analyzing LIOB, suggesting acoustically monitored LIOB has potential as an important tool in diagnosis and in vivo.",Lasers;Acoustics;Biomedical optical imaging;Ultrafast optics;Optical pulses;High-speed optical techniques;Optical imaging;laser induced optical breakdown;cavitation bubble;acoustic detection;high speed imaging;DDFP,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium,10.1109/ULTSYM.2014.0499
Thin titanium oxide films deposited by e-beam evaporation or by sputtering technique with additional rapid thermal oxidation,"Titanium oxide has been extensively studied not only in microelectronics, due to its high refractive index, excellent optical constants and high dielectric constant but also in materials science where it was proved to be a biocompatible oxide. In this work we show the structural and electrical characterization results of TiOx thin films obtained from rapid thermal oxidation of thin titanium films. A comparison between Ti films deposited by e-beam evaporation and sputtering technique with subsequent rapid thermal oxidation with different temperatures on Si wafers is presented. We analyzed the structural characteristics by Ellipsometry, Raman Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy and X-Ray Difraction identifying the tetragonal crystal structure of the rutile form of TiO2. Electrical characterizations were obtained through I-V and C-V curves of Al/Si/TiOx/Al capacitors. Field effect transistors were made in order to analyze ID×VDS, gM×VGS and ID×VGS curves. Electrical characterization of the best sample through the C-V curve showed dielectric constant equal to 8, interface states density in the order of 10-10eV-1.cm-2 and current density of the order of 10-4/cm2.

A feature selection based framework for histology image classification using global and local heterogeneity quantification,"Biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of chronic liver diseases. However, the concordance between readers is subject to variability causing an increasing need of objective tissue description methods. A complete framework has been implemented to analyze histological images from any kind of tissue. Based on the feature selection approach, it computes the most relevant subset of descriptors in terms of classification from a wide initial list of local and global descriptors. In comparison with equivalent methods, this implementation is able to find lists of descriptors which are significantly shorter for an equivalent accuracy and furthermore it enables the classification of slides using combinations of global and local measurements. The results have pointed that it could reach an accuracy of 82.8% in a human liver fibrosis grading approach by selecting 6 descriptors from an initial set of 258 global and local descriptors.",Feature extraction;Accuracy;Biomedical imaging;Indexes;Standards;Liver;Biopsy;framework;fibrosis;feature selection;support vector machines;quantification,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943991
A sputum smear microscopy image database for automatic bacilli detection in conventional microscopy,"In this work, we present an image database for automatic bacilli detection in sputum smear microscopy. The database comprises two parts. The first one, called the autofocus database, contains 1200 images with resolution of 2816 × 2112 pixels. This database was obtained from 12 slides, with 10 fields per slide. Each stack is composed of 10 images, with the fifth image in focus. The second one, called the segmentation and classification database, contains 120 images with resolution of 2816×2112 pixels. This database was obtained from 12 slices, with 10 fields per slice. In both databases, the images were acquired from fields of slides stained with the standard Kinyoun method. In both databases, accordingly to the background content, the images were classified as belonging to high background content or low background content. In all 120 images of segmentation and classification database, the identified objects were enclosed within a geometric shape by a trained technician. A true bacillus was enclosed in a circle. An agglomerated bacillus was enclosed by a rectangle and a doubtful bacillus (the image focus or geometry does not allow a clear identification of the object) was enclosed by a polygon.

Learning a cost function for microscope image segmentation,"Quantitative analysis of microscopy images is increasingly important in clinical researchers' efforts to unravel the cellular and molecular determinants of disease, and for pathological analysis of tissue samples. Yet, manual segmentation and measurement of cells or other features in images remains the norm in many fields. We report on a new system that aims for robust and accurate semi-automated analysis of microscope images. A user interactively outlines one or more examples of a target object in a training image. We then learn a cost function for detecting more objects of the same type, either in the same or different images. The cost function is incorporated into an active contour model, which can efficiently determine optimal boundaries by dynamic programming. We validate our approach and compare it to some standard alternatives on three different types of microscopic images: light microscopy of blood cells, light microscopy of muscle tissue sections, and electron microscopy cross-sections of axons and their myelin sheaths.",Image segmentation;Cost function;Muscles;Dynamic programming;Electron microscopy;Blood,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944873
Axonal transport velocity estimation from kymographs based on curvilinear feature extraction and spline fitting,"Axonal transport velocities are obtained from spatio-temporal maps called kymographs developed from time-lapse confocal microscopy movies of neurons. The kymographs of axonal transport of C.elegans worms are much noisier due to in vivo nature of imaging. Existing methodologies for velocity measurement include laborious manual delineation of axonal movement ridges on the kymographs and thereby determining particle velocities from the slopes of ridges marked. Manual kymograph analysis is not only time consuming but also prone to human errors in marking the ridges. An automated algorithm to extract all the ridges and determine the velocities without significant manual efforts is highly preferred. Not many methods are currently available for such biological studies. We present an almost automated method based on information fusion using LDA classifier, morphological image processing and spline fitting for determining axonal transport velocities. Experimental analysis of 50 kymographs shows considerable reduction of 89% in time taken with manual intervention of 10.83%. Comparitive study with the results of two of the previous literatures shows that our algorithm performs better.",Manuals;Algorithm design and analysis;Splines (mathematics);Image edge detection;Feature extraction;Motion pictures,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944560
Comparison of normalization algorithms for cross-batch color segmentation of histopathological images,"Automated processing of digital histopathology slides has the potential to streamline patient care and provide new tools for cancer classification and grading. Before automatic analysis is possible, quality control procedures are applied to ensure that each image can be read consistently. One important quality control step is color normalization of the slide image, which adjusts for color variances (batch-effects) caused by differences in stain preparation and image acquisition equipment. Color batch-effects affect color-based features and reduce the performance of supervised color segmentation algorithms on images acquired separately. To identify an optimal normalization technique for histopathological color segmentation applications, five color normalization algorithms were compared in this study using 204 images from four image batches. Among the normalization methods, two global color normalization methods normalized colors from all stain simultaneously and three stain color normalization methods normalized colors from individual stains extracted using color deconvolution. Stain color normalization methods performed significantly better than global color normalization methods in 11 of 12 cross-batch experiments (p<;0.05). Specifically, the stain color normalization method using k-means clustering was found to be the best choice because of high stain segmentation accuracy and low computational complexity.",Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Deconvolution;Bayes methods;Clustering algorithms;Accuracy;Cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943562
Semantic interpretation of robust imaging features for Fuhrman grading of renal carcinoma,"Pattern recognition in tissue biopsy images can assist in clinical diagnosis and identify relevant image characteristics linked with various biological characteristics. Although previous work suggests several informative imaging features for pattern recognition, there exists a semantic gap between characteristics of these features and pathologists' interpretation of histopathological images. To address this challenge, we develop a clinical decision support system for automated Fuhrman grading of renal carcinoma biopsy images. We extract 1316 color, shape, texture and topology features and develop one vs. all models for four Fuhrman grades. Our models are highly accurate with 90.4% accuracy in a four-class prediction. Predictivity analysis suggests good generalization of the model development methodology through robustness to dataset sampling in cross-validation. We provide a semantic interpretation for the imaging features used in these models by linking features to pathologists' grading criteria. Our study identifies novel imaging features that are semantically linked to Fuhrman grading criteria.",Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Shape;Predictive models;Accuracy;Cancer;Imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945104
Efficient epidermis segmentation for whole slide skin histopathological images,"In order to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system for histopathological skin cancer diagnosis, segmentation of the epidermis area is the very first and crucial step. An improved computer-aided epidermis segmentation technique for the whole slide skin histopathological image is proposed in this paper. The proposed technique first obtains an initial segmentation result with the help of global thresholding and shape analysis. A template matching method, with adaptive template intensity value, is then applied. Finally, a threshold is calculated based on the probability density function of the processed image after template matching. The threshold is then used to obtain the final segmentation result. Experimental results show that the proposed technique overcomes the limitation of the existing technique and provides a superior performance with sensitivity at 97.99%, and precision at 96.00%.",Epidermis;Image segmentation;Dermis;Shape;Probability density function;Cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944883
Morphological and textural analysis of centroblasts in low-thickness sliced tissue biopsies of follicular lymphoma,"This paper presents a new method for discriminating centroblast (CB) from non-centroblast cells in microscopic images acquired from tissue biopsies of follicular lymphoma. In the proposed method tissue sections are sliced at a low thickness level, around 1-1.5um, which provides a more detailed depiction of the nuclei and other textural information of cells usually not distinguishable in thicker specimens, such as 4-5um, that have been used in the past by other researchers. To identify CBs, a morphological and textural analysis is applied in order to extract various features related to their nuclei, nucleoli and cytoplasm. The generated feature vector is then used as input in a two-class SVM classifier with ε-Support Vector Regression and radial basis kernel function. Experimental results with an annotated dataset consisting of 300 images of centroblasts and non-centroblasts, derived from high-power field images of follicular lymphoma stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, have shown the great potential of the proposed method with an average detection rate of 97.44%.",Feature extraction;Histograms;Biomedical imaging;Support vector machine classification;Shape;Kernel,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944346
Two-dimensional sample entropy analysis of rat sural nerve aging,"Entropy analysis of images are usually performed using Shannon entropy, which calculates the probability of occurrency of each gray level on the image. However, not only the pixel gray level but also the spatial distribution of pixels might be important for image analysis. On the other hand, sample entropy (SampEn) is an important tool for estimation of irregularity in time series, which calculates the probability of pattern occurrence within the series. Therefore, we propose here an extension of SampEn to a two-dimensional case, namely SampEn2D, as an entropy method for extracting features from images that accounts for the spatial distribution of pixels. SampEn2D was applied to histological segments of sural nerve obtained from young (30 days) and elderly (720 days) rats. Morphometric indexes, such as the total number of myelinated fibers and the average myelinated fibers area and perimeter were also calculated. Results show that SampEn2D can extract useful information from histological nerve images, classifying elderly rat image as more regular than young rat. As SampEn2D is related to irregularity/unpredictability, we can conclude that the proposed method is complementary to morphometric indexes. Further studies are being built to validate SampEn2D.",Entropy;Aging;Time series analysis;Indexes;Rats;Pattern matching;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944339

Hematologist makes use of microscopic study of human blood, which leads to need of methods, including microscopic color imaging, segmentation, classification and clustering that can allow identification of patients suffering from Leukemia. The microscopic images will be inspected visually by hematologists and the process is time consuming and tiring. The automatic image processing system is urgently needed and can overcome related constraints in visual inspection. The proposed system will be on microscopic images to detect Leukemia. The early and fast identification of Leukemia greatly aids in providing the appropriate treatment. Initial segmentation is done using Statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation which segregates white blood cells from other blood components i.e. erythrocytes and platelets. Geometrical features such as area, perimeter of the white blood cell nucleusis investigated for diagnostic prediction of Leukemia. The proposed method is successfully applied to a large number of images, showing promising results for varying image quality.

Investigation of retinoic acid induced phenotype of neuroblastoma cells,"Retinoic acid and its synthetic derivatives are considered as potential agents in cancer therapy because of its pharmacological effect to promote differentiation and to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells. However, clinical trials are greatly hindered by the side effect of retinoic acid with pharmacological dose and limited knowledge of retinoic acid functionalizing exerted on entire cells. Here, we applied atomic force microscopy as a less invasive approach to monitor the retinoic acid induced effect on entire live neuroblastoma cells. Our studies demonstrated that the live SH-SY5Y cells were stiffened and demonstrated the morphology of orientated growth. The Young's modulus and surface roughness of cells were increased under retinoic acid stimulus, which could serve as novel indicators for possibly development of anti-cancer drug screening.",Cancer;Force;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Microscopy;Surface treatment;Young's modulus,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,14th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology,10.1109/NANO.2014.6968089
Synchrotron Microscopic Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Analyses of Biogenic Guanine Crystals Along Axes of Easy Magnetization,"Our previous study remained a question why biogenic guanine crystals that cause magnetic orientation under magnetic fields scattered light so intensively. In addition, the magnetic orientation analyses indicated that the crystal plate has primal and second axes of easy magnetization by diamagnetism, by which two-stage orientation of the crystal is caused. This paper aims to reveal the molecule arrangement inside the guanine crystal, which is related to optical and magnetic anisotropy. A transient light scattering increase from the guanine crystals that occurs with increasing and decreasing magnetic fields between 0 and 0.5 T was measured. The results indicate that the biogenic guanine crystal plates have a specific direction to scatter the light incidence. In the next, molecular vibrations in a single-crystal plate were investigated by utilizing the synchrotron microscopic Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and the obtained spectrum compared with that in magnetically oriented guanine crystal. The FTIR and attenuated total reflectance measurements reproducibly observed the IR absorbance spectrum peak appearance and disappearance when the polarization direction was set parallel and perpendicular to the morphological length of a biogenic guanine crystal. It is speculated that spectrum peak appearance and disappearance were caused by vibration of C = O bonds and N-H bonds in guanine crystal for polarization direction. In conclusion, we revealed that the surface and inside of biogenic guanine crystal possessed the anisotropy for molecule orientation related to optical and magnetic property.",Crystals;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Microscopy;Optical polarization;Synchrotrons;Biomedical optical imaging;Attenuated total reflectance (ATR);biogenic guanine crystal;magnetic field;synchrotron microscopic Fourier transform infrared (FTIR),ARTICLE,2014,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,10.1109/TMAG.2014.2329239
Influences of the vertebral endplate microvasculature on the development of degenerative disc diseases: A preliminary study,"An average of 70% of all Americans will suffer from one episode of low back pain (LBP) in their lifetime [1]. Senescence of the avascular nucleus pulposus with decreased transport of nutrients is thought to lead to degenerative disc diseases (DDD) and low back pain [2-5]. We investigated the relationship between aging, cartilage endplate microvasculature, and the level of disc degeneration. Lumbar discs with adjacent endplates were harvested from three fresh young bovine and three embalmed human cadaveric spines. After tissue processing, histology, and staining, microscopic features of endplate vascular channels were visualized under light microscopy and measured using ImageJ. Our preliminary data showed a 15% decrease in the vascular channel count at the interface between subchondral bone and cartilage endplate from the bovine to the elderly human specimens. Moreover, we observed a 67% increase in endplate thickness and a 70% decrease in cross sectional vascular area in the human subjects.",Bovine;Diseases;Back;Pain;Spine;Microscopy;Bones;Low back pain;Degenerative disc disease;Microvessels;Cartilage endplate;disc nutrition,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 40th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC),10.1109/NEBEC.2014.6972980
Significance of the interlamellar interfaces in the micromechanics of Haversian bone,Global and local effects of interface structures in the biomechanics of Haversian bone are elucidated by forming experimental based finite element (FE) models of the bone tissue. Geometry of microstructural features in the bone was extracted by polishing and optical microscopy from the surface of each specimen. These measurements were then incorporated into the FE models.

Experiments with large ensembles for segmentation and classification of cervical cancer biopsy images,"To classify cervical cells as normal or cancer, the histological image must be segmented. After segmentation mean nuclear volume can be used to distinguish between normal and cancer cells. Due to the rapid reproduction of cancer cells, they have higher mean nuclear volume than typical normal cells. We propose a large ensemble of segmentations which separate normal and cancer cases based on the single feature of mean nuclear volume. Four basic segmentors with different parameters generate the segmentations. The mean nuclear volume is extracted from the segmentations. The dataset used for this paper contained multiple images from 30 normal and 32 cancer patients. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) was used to stain archival tissue sections from the normal cervix and cervical cancers. Results show it is possible to predict class with greater than 84% accuracy.",Image segmentation;Cancer;Biopsy;Accuracy;Feature extraction;Gray-scale;Image edge detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)",10.1109/SMC.2014.6974021
Multimodal approach to image perception of histology for the blind or visually impaired,"Currently there is no suitable substitute technology to enable blind or visually impaired people (BVI) to interpret visual scientific data commonly generated during lab experimentation in real time, such as performing light microscopy, spectrometry, and observing chemical reactions. This reliance upon visual interpretation of scientific data certainly impedes BVIs from advancing in careers in medicine, biology and chemistry. To address this challenge, a real-time multimodal image perception system is developed to transform the standard lab blood smear image for persons with BVI to perceive, employing a combination of auditory, haptic, and vibrotactile feedbacks. These sensory feedbacks are used to convey visual information in appropriate perceptual channels, thus creating a palette of multimodal, sensorial information. A Bayesian network is developed to characterize images through two groups of features of interest: primary and peripheral features. Then, a method is conceived for optimal matching between primary features and sensory modalities. Experimental results confirmed this real-time approach of higher accuracy in recognizing and analyzing objects within images compared to tactile papers.",Time factors;Error analysis;Bayes methods;Shape;Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Viscosity;sensorial substitution;multi-modality;image perception;blind or visually impaired;haptics;vibrotactile,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)",10.1109/SMC.2014.6974544
A Segmentation Method for Bone Marrow Cavity Imaging Using Graph Cuts,"The improvement of bioimaging technologies enables the observation of cellular dynamics invivo. Some new bioimaging technologies are expected to contribute to the discovery of new drugs and mechanisms of disease. To improve the contributions of bioimaging, it is required to extract a particular region or to detect a particular cell's motion within bioimages. Moreover, automatic extraction and detection with image processing is also required because the accurate and uniformed processing of a massive number of images manually is unrealistic. To help automate this process, we introduce a bone marrow cavity segmentation method for two-photon excitation microscopy images. Specialists of cellular dynamics define regions of bone marrow cavity by considering several criteria, including characteristics of intensity and blood flow. We take those criteria into our method as the energy function of graph cuts. Results of evaluations and comparison with normal graph cuts show that our proposed method that does not use hard constraints achieved a performance better than normal graph cuts with hard constraints.",Bones;Image segmentation;Cavity resonators;Blood;Microscopy;Educational institutions;Graph Cuts;Bone Marrow Cavity Image,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 1st Workshop on Pattern Recognition Techniques for Indirect Immunofluorescence Images,10.1109/I3A.2014.21
Localization of Diagnostically Relevant Regions of Interest in Whole Slide Images,"Whole slide imaging technology enables pathologists to screen biopsy images and make a diagnosis in a digital form. This creates an opportunity to understand the screening patterns of expert pathologists and extract the patterns that lead to accurate and efficient diagnoses. For this purpose, we are taking the first step to interpret the recorded actions of world-class expert pathologists on a set of digitized breast biopsy images. We propose an algorithm to extract regions of interest from the logs of image screenings using zoom levels, time and the magnitude of panning motion. Using diagnostically relevant regions marked by experts, we use the visual bag-of-words model with texture and color features to describe these regions and train probabilistic classifiers to predict similar regions of interest in new whole slide images. The proposed algorithm gives promising results for detecting diagnostically relevant regions.

Shape-Based Classification of Environmental Microorganisms,"Occurrence of certain environmental microorganisms and their species is a very informative indicator to evaluate environmental quality. Unfortunately, their manual recognition in microbiological laboratories is very time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we work on an automatic method for shape-based classification of EMs in microscopic images. First, we segment the microorganisms from the background. Second, we describe their shapes by discriminative feature vectors. Third, we perform the EM classification using Support Vector Machines. The most important scientific contribution of this paper, in comparison to the state-of-the-art and to our previous publications in this field, is the introduction of a completely new and very robust 2D feature descriptor for EM shapes. Experimental results certify the effectiveness and practicability of our automatic EM classification system emphasising the benefits achieved with the new shape descriptor proposed in this work.",Shape;Image segmentation;Microorganisms;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Microscopy;Image analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition,10.1109/ICPR.2014.581
Quantification of Actin Structures Using Unsupervised Pattern Analysis Techniques,"The analysis of F-actin organization in cells is a key topic in many fields of biomedical research.

In this paper, we present a new approach for the analysis of actin structures in microscopy images and the quantification of differences and similarities in actin organization between cells. Compared to existing methods, our approach does not require any previous knowledge about the cells or structures to be analyzed. It works in an unsupervised fashion, combining statistical texture measures and clustering techniques. By this, our method yields large flexibility and allows for application in a wide range of experimental scenarios, and also to heterogeneous cell populations.

Detection of Tumor Cell Spheroids from Co-cultures Using Phase Contrast Images and Machine Learning Approach,"Automated image analysis is demanded in cell biology and drug development research. The type of microscopy is one of the considerations in the trade-offs between experimental setup, image acquisition speed, molecular labelling, resolution and quality of images. In many cases, phase contrast imaging gets higher weights in this optimization. And it comes at the price of reduced image quality in imaging 3D cell cultures. For such data, the existing state-of-the-art computer vision methods perform poorly in segmenting specific cell type. Low SNR, clutter and occlusions are basic challenges for blind segmentation approaches. In this study we propose an automated method, based on a learning framework, for detecting particular cell type in cluttered 2D phase contrast images of 3D cell cultures that overcomes those challenges. It depends on local features defined over super pixels. The method learns appearance based features, statistical features, textural features and their combinations. Also, the importance of each feature is measured by employing Random Forest classifier.

We show that by using only local texture descriptors we achieve a classification rate of almost 89% on texture patches from 15 different virus types and a debris (false object) class. We compare and combine 5 different types of local texture descriptors and show that by combining the different types a lower classification error is achieved.

A CAD mitosis detection system from breast cancer histology images based on fused features,"Nowadays, automatic computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for grading different types of cancers like breast cancer are very prevalent. These systems employ histopathology slide images acquired by advanced and well-defined digital scanners. The previously proposed automatic or computer-aided systems for breast cancer grading, especially by counting mitoses, suffer from various types of deficiencies. The most important one is their low efficiency along with high complexity due to the huge amount of features. In this paper, two types of features with more flexibility and less complexity are employed. These features are Completed Local Binary Pattern (CLBP) as textural features and Stiffness Matrix as geometric, morphometric and shape-based features. In the proposed automatic mitosis detection system, these two features are fused with each other. The evaluation results are for histology Dataset H (Hamamatsu Nanozoomer Scanners) provided by Mitos-ICPR2012 contest sponsors.

Wavelet-based statistical features for distinguishing mitotic and non-mitotic cells in breast cancer histopathology,"To diagnose breast cancer (BCa), the number of mitotic cells present in tissue sections is an important parameter to examine and grade breast biopsy specimen. The differentiation of mitotic from non-mitotic cells in breast histopathological images is a crucial step for automatical mitosis detection. This work aims at improving the accuracy of mitosis classification by characterizing objects of interest (tissue cells) in wavelet based multi-resolution representations that better capture the statistical features having mitosis discrimination. A dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) is performed to decompose the image patches into multi-scale forms. Five commonly-used statistical features are extracted on each wavelet subband. Since both mitotic and non-mitotic cells appear as small objects with a large variety of shapes in the images, characterization of mitosis is a challenging problem. The inter-scale dependencies of wavelet coefficients allow extraction of important texture features within the cells that are more likely to appear at all different scales. The wavelet-based statistical features were evaluated on a dataset containing 327 mitotic and 406 non-mitotic cells via a support vector machine classifier in iterative cross-validation. The quantitative results showed that our DT-CWT based approach achieved superior classification performance with the accuracy of 87.94%, sensitivity of 86.80%, specificity of 89.89%, and the area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.94.",Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Support vector machines;Wavelet transforms;Shape;Image segmentation;mitosis;wavelet transform;multi-resolution representation;breast cancer histopathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025464
Automatic dendritic spine detection using multiscale dot enhancement filters and SIFT features,"Statistical characterization of morphological changes of dendritic spines is becoming of crucial interest in the field of neurobiology. Automatic detection and segmentation of dendritic spines promises significant reductions on the time spent by the scientists and reduces the subjectivity concerns. In this paper, we present two approaches for automated detection of dendritic spines in 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (2pLSM) images. The first method combines the idea of dot enhancement filters with information from the dendritic skeleton. The second method learns an SVM classifier by utilizing some pre-labeled SIFT feature descriptors and uses the classifier to detect dendritic spines in new images. For the segmentation of detected spines, we employ a watershed-variational segmentation algorithm.

Machine Learning based Approach for Water pollution detection via fish liver microscopic images analysis,"This article presents an automatic classification approach for assessing water quality based on fish liver histopathology. As fish liver is a good bioindicator for detecting water chemical pollution, the proposed approach utilizes fish liver microscopic images in order to detect water pollution. The proposed approach consists of three phases; namely pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification phases. Since color and texture are the most important characteristics of microscopic fish liver images, the proposed system uses colored histogram and Gabor wavelet transform for classifying water quality degree. Also, it implemented Principal Components Analysis (PCA) along with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms for feature extraction and water quality degree classification, respectively. Collected datasets contain colored JPEG images of 125 images as training dataset and 45 images as testing dataset, respectively. Training dataset is divided into 4 classes representing the different histopathlogical changes and their corresponding water quality degrees. Experimental results showed that the proposed classification approach has obtained water quality classification accuracy of 93.3%, using SVMs linear kernel function with 37 images per class for training.",Water pollution;Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Chemicals;Recurrent neural networks;Pipeline processing;classification;features extraction;fish liver;histopathology;water pollution;principal component analysis (PCA);support vector machines (SVMs);microscopic images,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 9th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES),10.1109/ICCES.2014.7030968
A dual probes AFM system with effective tilting angles to achieve high-precision scanning,"With the constant improvement of micro-fabrication techniques, the measurement of feature size of micro-fabricated structures becomes an important issue. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a high accuracy measurement instrument which has been widely used in micro-fabricated structures measurement recently. However, due to the monotonic tilting angle of the probe in traditional AFM system, the scanning results of sample with high steep wall feature usually have distortion phenomenon at the corner part of the sample. To solve this problem, a novel dual probe AFM system is proposed in this paper. A system structure with high flexibility is used in this work to create different tilting angle of each probe. With the tilting angle deciding method developed in this paper, we can estimate the effective tilting angles for scanning under different scenarios. In addition, a useful merging method is also designed in this work, which can stich result from different scanning unit together and produce high-precision scanning results. Experimental results are shown to validate the outstanding capability of the proposed system and methods.",Probes;Merging;Microscopy;Accuracy;Measurement units;Optical distortion;Optical microscopy;Atomic force microscopy (AFM);dual-probe AFM;merging method;tilting angle;high-precision scanning,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,10.1109/CDC.2014.7040457
Segmentation and quantification of activated sludge floes for wastewater treatment,"Activated sludge process is commonly used in wastewater treatment plants to process domestic or industrial effluent. The main objects of interest in the activated sludge systems are floes and filamentous organisms. The proper settling of the sludge floes in the activated sludge wastewater treatment process is crucial to the normal functioning of the system. In this paper image processing techniques are used to segment and detect activated sludge floes in microscopic images of activated sludge. This can be helpful in the study of the morphology of floes and their quantification. In this paper, Otsu thresholding, k-means and fuzzy c-means segmentation techniques are used to segment and detect floes in microscopic images of activated sludge. The performance of the segmentation techniques is assessed for activated sludge images at different microscopic magnifications using global consistency error (GCE. Ground truth images are used to benchmark the accuracy of segmentation algorithms. Otsu thresholding method performed better segmentation in terms GCE. But the performance of segmentation deteriorates at higher magnifications. The quantification of floes also provides a means for assessing the segmentation performance of different algorithms. Otsu thresholding has better quantification performance as compared to fuzzy c-means and k-means, with some apparent exceptions caused by imperfect segmentation of images at 40 times magnification.",Image segmentation;Lighting;Microscopy;Wastewater treatment;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Conferences;activated sludge;wastewater treatment;image processing;image segmentation;quantification;assessment,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE Conference on Open Systems (ICOS),10.1109/ICOS.2014.7042403
Comparative study on feature descriptors for brain image analysis,"A key obstacle to developing automated histopathology assessment tools is the difficulty of defining quantifiable image features that could serve as fundamental data elements capable of distinguishing key disease types and subtypes. A variety of feature extraction and selection methods for histology images have been proposed. However, comparisons of different feature descriptor approaches remains challenging because of varying datasets and emphases chosen by different authors. As an example of how a shared reference atlas could accelerate efforts in this area. In this study, we constructed normal and disease sample datasets by standardizing histology images employed from Allen Brain Atlas. After preparing the datasets, we extracted features mentioned in the preceding studies from the datasets to characterize normal and disease tissues. To confirm statistical significance between the normal and disease images, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed. The experimental results indicated that topological features are effective to distinguish the normal images from the disease ones. This paper also shows the details of construction of the datasets, segmentation of nuclei, feature descriptors and the experimental results. We discuss the effectiveness and generalizability of derived features.",History;Economics;Companies;Web services;Databases;Social network services;Electric breakdown;Brain image analysis;Biomedical informatics;Feature extraction;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 Joint 7th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (SCIS) and 15th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems (ISIS),10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2014.7044900
Automatic detection of mitosis cell in breast cancer histopathology images using genetic algorithm,"Nowadays, pathologist« grade breast cancer histopathology slides by microscopes based on Nottingham as an international standard. The mitotic counting is one of the three scoring criteria in Nottingham standard for breast cancer grading based on histopathology slide image studies. Large number of non-mitosis organs, which exists in histopathology slide tissue, is one of the most important challenges facing mitosis detection methods. In this paper, a system for automatic mitosis detection purpose from breast cancer histopathology slide images is proposed to aid pathologists for mitotic cells counting. In the proposed algorithm the number of non-mitosis candidates are defined as a cast function and by minimization using Genetic Optimization algorithm, the most of the non-mitosis candidates will be omitted. Then some features such as co-occurrence and run-length matrices and Gabor features are extracted from the rest of candidates and finally mitotic cells are classified using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this method to detect mitotic cells in breast cancer histology images.",Biomedical engineering;Educational institutions;High definition video;Channel hot electron injection;DH-HEMTs;breast cancer;classification;feature extraction;mitosis detection;Genetic optimization;Support vector classification (SVM);Complete Local Binary Pattern (CLBP),INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 21th Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME),10.1109/ICBME.2014.7043883
Color-based Fuzzy Classifier for automated detection of cancerous cells in histopathological analysis,"In usual clinical practice, grading of cancer tissues is often done by an expert histopathologist based on their analysis of micro-level architectural features of the cancerous tissue specimen as well as level of presence of certain protein molecules in the specimen. This process of assessment of the level of presence of protein molecules is extremely subjective due to human dependence and limitations and, therefore, causes large inter-expert and sometimes even intra-expert variability and potentially adding noise to the process of selecting the treatment regime that the patient is put on. Quantification of immunohistochemical (IHC) stains used to highlight, in general, healthy and malignant tissues, is critical for an objective assessment of any type of cancer's histopathological specimens. In addition, pathologist's workload is also a serious problem in any hospital, where disease load and mortality statistics are increasing. The impact of not having an objective method for diagnosis and the lack of pathologists will lead to delay in diagnosis and misdiagnosis that can harmfully affect patient treatment and survival. In this paper, an algorithmic approach is presented in order to quantify and then classify based on the same type of information that a human expert would utilize, i.e. color. The subjectivity of color detection is embedded in the design as Fuzzy Classifier based on a range of colors rather than specific color values. The procedure can be automated to classify, and then further quantify for any specific measure, such as number of specific type of cells present, etc... This is expected to reduce the load on the pathologists and increase the quality of diagnosis.",Image color analysis;Cancer;Classification algorithms;Biomedical engineering;Immune system;Conferences;Hospitals,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences (IECBES),10.1109/IECBES.2014.7047464
Robust autofocusing for whole slide scanning microscopy,"Autofocusing is one of the key issues in automatic microscopy, which is widely used in various biomedical applications such as bacterial and cell morphology. Existing autofocusing methods are sensitive to image content density and thus the global maximum may be drowned in noises especially when the images have sparse texture. Another drawback of the existing methods is that the focus range is always limited to a well-defined scope which is not in conformity with the fact where wide range autofocusing is required. In this paper, we propose a robust autofocusing algorithm to overcome these problems. We use three strategies to make the algorithm robust. First, a focus measure enhancement method was proposed to improve the steepness of the focus curve. Second, based on the analysis of the focus curve profile, we developed a focal plane search method with unrestricted search range which is critical for wide range autofocusing. Third, a continuous autofocusing model was established for guiding whole slide scanning. Furthermore, a fully automated whole slide scanning microscopy system has been implemented and the performance of the proposed method was demonstrated on this system. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by improving both the success rate and the speed of autofocusing for various specimens with different image content densities.",Microscopy;Frequency measurement;Robustness;Noise;Biomedical measurement;Search methods;Optical microscopy;Autofocusing;Focus measure;Image content;Focal plane search;Continuous autofocusing,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,Proceeding of the 11th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation,10.1109/WCICA.2014.7053020
Experimental investigation on partial discharge characteristics of epoxy-nanocomposite as high voltage insulation material,"Partial discharge (PD) is a major problem in high voltage (HV) insulation that it can lead to electrical degradation and ultimate failure of the insulation materials. Recent research found that with the use of nanoparticles, the correct combination of nanofiller with resin will enhance the electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of HV insulation. Boron nitride (BN) is a ceramic dielectric material, with high electrical breakdown strength and high thermal conductivity. This research investigated the effects of BN nanofiller on the PD characteristics of epoxy resin, using CIGRE Method II electrode configuration. The PD number, PD charge magnitude, and average of PD charge during the ageing time under HV stress were investigated. Moreover, the degraded surfaces of the tested samples were examined using optical microscopy techniques before and after PD stress. The results revealed that higher BN nanofiller percentage will decrease the PD magnitude, PD number and the PD charge. As a consequence, the degraded area caused by the PD activities decreases as the amount of the BN nanofiller increases.",Partial discharges;Insulation;Aging;Degradation;Stress;Polymers;Partial discharge (PD) characteristics;Boron Nitride (BN) nanofiller;Epoxy resin;Polymer nanocomposite;Morphological observation;Optical Microscopy;CIGRE Method II,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy (PECon),10.1109/PECON.2014.7062430
Image-based plant stornata phenotyping,"We propose in this paper a fully automatic approach for image-based plant stornata phenotyping. Given a microscopic image of a plant leaf surface, our goal is to automatically detect stornata cells and measure their morphological and structural features, such as stornata opening length and width, and size of the guard cells. The main challenge in developing such tool is the lack of contrast between the stornata cell region and its surrounding background. Our approach uses template matching to detect individual stornata cells and local analysis to measure stornata features within the detected stornata regions. It is fully automatic and computationally efficient. Thus, it will enable plant biologists to perform large scale analysis of stornata morphology, which in turn will help in developing understanding and controlling plant's response to various environmental stresses (e.g. drought and soil salinity).",Apertures;Plants (biology);Manuals;Feature extraction;Length measurement;Morphology,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 13th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV),10.1109/ICARCV.2014.7064307
Segmentation assessment of activated sludge flocs at different magnifications for wastewater treatment,"Activated sludge process form an important part of wastewater treatment plant with domestic effluent. The variations in the state of the process are appeared as those in the size and structure of flocs and filaments found in the wastewater samples from aeration tank of secondary treatment. The normal operation requires proper settling of flocs in the secondary clarifier, which is affected by problem of bulking and pin point flocs. Conventional physico-chemical methods take a lot of time to detect the abnormal operation, consequently leaving insufficient time for precautionary measures. Image processing and analysis of microscopic images can offer a time-efficient alternative to monitor the operation of activated sludge process. Segmentation is a necessary part of image processing and analysis for identification of regions of interest in the image, and its acceptable accuracy is pre-requisite of the morphological analysis. In this paper, three segmentation techniques, fuzzy cmeans, k-means and Otsu thresholding, were used to segment flocs in microscopic images of samples taken from aeration tank of activated sludge process. The performance of the segmentation algorithms was evaluated for images taken at four different objective magnifications of microscope, using metrics of global consistency error (GCE), random index (RI) and variation of information (VI). The performance metrics were evaluated by comparing the segmented images with the approximation of ground truth images. Finally, the effect of magnification was investigated on the image segmentation and analysis procedure and observed that the size of floc, perceptible to the image segmentation and analysis procedure is greater and more precise at higher magnification.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation methods;Databases;Wastewater treatment;Approximation algorithms;activated sludge;image segmentation;image processing,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE 2014)",10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072787
An intelligent mobile-based automatic diagnostic system to identify retinal diseases using mathematical morphological operations,"Diabetic retinopathy is considered in terms of the presence of exudates which cause vision loss in the areas affected. This study targets the development of an intelligent mobile-based automatic diagnosis integrated with a microscopic lens to identify retinal diseases at initial stage at any time or place. Exudate detection is a significant step in order obtaining an early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, and if they are segmented accurately, laser treatment can be applied effectively. Consequently, precise segmentation is the fundamental step in exudate extraction. This paper proposes a technique for exudate segmentation in colour retinal images using morphological operations. In this method, after pre-processing, the optic disc and blood vessels are isolated from the retinal image. Exudates are then segmented by a combination of morphological operations such as the modified regionprops function and a reconstruction technique. The proposed technique is verified against the DIARETDB1 database and achieves 85.39% sensitivity. The proposed technique achieves better exudate detection results in terms of sensitivity than other recent methods reported in the literature. In future work, our system will be deployed to a mobile platform to allow efficient and instant diagnosis.",Optical imaging;Retina;Optical filters;Biomedical imaging;Diabetes;Image segmentation;Blood vessels;Diabetic Retinopathy;Mobile Technology;Exudates;Optic Disc;Morphological Operation,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,"The 8th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA 2014)",10.1109/SKIMA.2014.7083563
Red Blood based disease screening using marker controlled watershed segmentation and post-processing,"Cell segmentation is a challenging problem due to the complexity and nature of the blood cells. Traditional methods of counting the cells are slow, error prone and often influenced by the performance of the operator. This paper aims to segment and count Red Blood Cells (RBCs) automatically shown in microscopic blood images to determine the condition of the person under examination. We also aim to increase the accuracy of segmentation by precisely looking into the counting of the overlapped cells which is the most conventional challenging task faced by many researchers. The RBCs in this paper are segmented using the integration of marker controlled watershed segmentation with morphological operations. The result of the proposed algorithm was validated with the manual counting method, and a good conformity of about 93.13 % was obtained.

Efficient classification of pollen grains using computational intelligence approach,"Pollen grains play an important role in classification system of plants. Pollen morphological characters are very useful in plant classification and identification of plants. Pollen studies are widely used in allergy and epidemiology research, fossil fuel exploration, forensic science, food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry, biotechnology, and so many other fields. Hence classification of pollen grains is a challenge that can be effectively done by computational intelligence approach. The traditional method of pollen classification analyses the pollen morphological characters using microscopy. This procedure is tedious and requires experts from the field of palynology. With a view to extract features from pollen images, a new classification strategy is developed which proposes Image Histogram coefficients in addition to image statistics and shape descriptor. The suitability of classifiers based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is explored with the optimization of their respective parameters in view of reduction in time as well as space complexity. Performance of two classifiers has been compared with respect to MSE, NMSE, and Classification accuracy. The Average Classification Accuracy of MLP comprising of two hidden layers is found to be superior (95 % on Cross Validation dataset) to SVM based classifier. Finally, optimal Classification strategy has been developed, which could be easily modified to classify more than 10 species. The proposed strategy will provide an effective alternative to traditional method of pollen image analysis for plant taxonomy and species identification, which is obvious from the cross-validation performance on the dataset containing ten different plant species.",Artificial neural networks;Training;Biological neural networks;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Histograms;Shape;Pollen SEM images;palynology;Computational Intelligence;Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network;Support Vector Machine;Classifier,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,International Conference for Convergence for Technology-2014,10.1109/I2CT.2014.7092120
Underwater man-made object prediction using line detection technique,"Underwater imaging is primarily focused on search and rescue, underwater mine detection, underwater cable and pipeline overhauling and underwater geological survey. Main challenge in underwater imaging is blurriness. In underwater environment blurriness is caused by many factors which includes microscopic organism, impurities and density of water which effects refractive index of water, and bokeh which is blurred effect on those region of image that are out of focus in range. Picture of a moving object also have a blur effect, reason is motion blur. To detect object in underwater image, integration of different image processing technique has been made.

Segmentation of cells with inclusions in plant cross sectional images,"Computerized analysis of microscopic cross sectional images of plant parts is useful for authentication and quality assessment of plant materials. The analysis involves segmentation of cells in the cross section, extraction of cell features and classification of cells. The segmentation of individual cells plays a major role in realistic estimation of cell parameters for identification and classification of cells. However, the segmentation of the cells is adversely influenced due to presence of cell inclusions like starch grains which are stained with different colored dyes for improved visibility. During segmentation, the stained inclusions touching the boundary of the cells result in boundary cavities which deform the shape of the segmented cells. The present paper describes an image processing technique for accurate segmentation of cells in the presence of stained cell inclusions. The proposed method corrects the shape of individual cells by identifying and selective filling of the boundary cavities resulting from stained inclusions with the help of convex image of the cells and morphological skeleton of the background region. The proposed method is demonstrated by testing a plant cross sectional image containing starch grains.",Cavity resonators;Image segmentation;Skeleton;Image color analysis;Filling;Shape;Conferences;image processing;optical microscopy;plant cell segmentation;cavity filling,INPROCEEDINGS,2014,2014 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO),10.1109/ISCO.2014.7103943
An automatic and cost-effective parasitemia identification framework for low-end microscopy imaging devices,"In the detection of Malarial parasites from a patient, it is usually necessary to carefully examine the corresponding blood-slide smear and distinguish the infected and healthy Red Blood Cells (RBCs). If this process is done manually, as evidenced in common traditional approaches, the following challenges may be encountered: inaccuracy of the lab results, which originates from normal human errors or lack of experience of a person conducting diagnosis, and large processing times. Consequently, doctors and specialists are likely to provide improper prescriptions to patients. With the improvement of the computational power of computers, however, the whole diagnosis process can be automated. Several methods in literature have been proposed for this purpose. Most of these methods demand the availability of high-end microscopy imaging systems to generate reliable and accurate results. Such costly advanced devices may not be afforded by developing countries with sluggish economic growth. In this paper, therefore, we have developed a cost-effective framework which can address the mentioned challenge. Our approach introduces a Super Resolution (SR) model into the existing framework to enhance the resolution of the input images before letting them subjected to the subsequent detection stages. This provides a possibility for applying the low-end microscopy devices capable of capturing Low Resolution (LR) blood smear images for identifying the degree of Malaria in a patient. In the proposed framework, the SR component uses the nonlinear Charbonnier diffusion model in the regularization part because of its good regularity characteristics.

The HSI camera alone has been tested for some fluorescent molecules in multi-well samples to unambiguously discriminate them by analyzing the spectral fingerprints. Compared with other techniques the “multi label fluorescence microscope” has the advantage to acquire spectra of different dyes simultaneously without the use of multiple filters set or dispersive means.

An Integrated Approach to Analysis of Phytoplankton Images,"The main objective of this paper is detection, recognition, and abundance estimation of objects representing the Prorocentrum minimum (Pavillard) Schiller (P. minimum) species in phytoplankton images. The species is known to cause harmful blooms in many estuarine and coastal environments. The proposed technique for solving the task exploits images of two types, namely, obtained using light and fluorescence microscopy. Various image preprocessing techniques are applied to extract a variety of features characterizing P. minimum cells and cell contours. Relevant feature subsets are then selected and used in support vector machine (SVM) as well as random forest (RF) classifiers to distinguish between P. minimum cells and other objects. To improve the cell abundance estimation accuracy, classification results are corrected based on probabilities of interclass misclassification. The developed algorithms were tested using 158 phytoplankton images. There were 920 P. minimum cells in the images in total. The algorithms detected 98.1% of P. minimum cells present in the images and correctly classified 98.09% of all detected objects. The classification accuracy of detected P. minimum cells was equal to 98.9%, yielding a 97.0% overall recognition rate of P. minimum cells. The feature set used in this work has shown considerable tolerance to out-of-focus distortions. Tests of the system by phytoplankton experts in the cell abundance estimation task of P. minimum species have shown that its performance is comparable or even better than performance of phytoplankton experts exhibited in manual counting of artificial microparticles, similar to P. minimum cells. The automated system detected and correctly recognized 308 (91.1%) of 338 P. minimum cells found by experts in 65 phytoplankton images taken from new phytoplankton samples and erroneously assigned to the P. minimum class 3% of other objects. Note that, due to large variations of texture and size of P. minimum cells as well as background, the task performed by the system was more complex than that performed by the experts when counting artificial microparticles similar to P. minimum cells.",Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Accuracy;Estimation;Shape;Classification committee;feature extraction;feature selection;phytoplankton images;Prorocentrum minimum;random forests (RFs);support vector machine (SVM),ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,10.1109/JOE.2014.2317955
Two-Tier Tissue Decomposition for Histopathological Image Representation and Classification,"In digital pathology, devising effective image representations is crucial to design robust automated diagnosis systems. To this end, many studies have proposed to develop object-based representations, instead of directly using image pixels, since a histopathological image may contain a considerable amount of noise typically at the pixel-level. These previous studies mostly employ color information to define their objects, which approximately represent histological tissue components in an image, and then use the spatial distribution of these objects for image representation and classification. Thus, object definition has a direct effect on the way of representing the image, which in turn affects classification accuracies. In this paper, our aim is to design a classification system for histopathological images. Towards this end, we present a new model for effective representation of these images that will be used by the classification system. The contributions of this model are twofold. First, it introduces a new two-tier tissue decomposition method for defining a set of multityped objects in an image. Different than the previous studies, these objects are defined combining texture, shape, and size information and they may correspond to individual histological tissue components as well as local tissue subregions of different characteristics. As its second contribution, it defines a new metric, which we call dominant blob scale, to characterize the shape and size of an object with a single scalar value. Our experiments on colon tissue images reveal that this new object definition and characterization provides distinguishing representation of normal and cancerous histopathological images, which is effective to obtain more accurate classification results compared to its counterparts.",Shape;Feature extraction;Measurement;Cancer;Image representation;Image edge detection;Image color analysis;Automated cancer diagnosis;blob;digital pathology;histopathological image representation;tissue decomposition model,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2014.2354373
Supervised Multi-View Canonical Correlation Analysis (sMVCCA): Integrating Histologic and Proteomic Features for Predicting Recurrent Prostate Cancer,"In this work, we present a new methodology to facilitate prediction of recurrent prostate cancer (CaP) following radical prostatectomy (RP) via the integration of quantitative image features and protein expression in the excised prostate. Creating a fused predictor from high-dimensional data streams is challenging because the classifier must 1) account for the “curse of dimensionality” problem, which hinders classifier performance when the number of features exceeds the number of patient studies and 2) balance potential mismatches in the number of features across different channels to avoid classifier bias towards channels with more features. Our new data integration methodology, supervised Multi-view Canonical Correlation Analysis (sMVCCA), aims to integrate infinite views of highdimensional data to provide more amenable data representations for disease classification. Additionally, we demonstrate sMVCCA using Spearman's rank correlation which, unlike Pearson's correlation, can account for nonlinear correlations and outliers. Forty CaP patients with pathological Gleason scores 6-8 were considered for this study. 21 of these men revealed biochemical recurrence (BCR) following RP, while 19 did not. For each patient, 189 quantitative histomorphometric attributes and 650 protein expression levels were extracted from the primary tumor nodule. The fused histomorphometric/proteomic representation via sMVCCA combined with a random forest classifier predicted BCR with a mean AUC of 0.74 and a maximum AUC of 0.9286. We found sMVCCA to perform statistically significantly (p <; 0.05) better than comparative state-of-the-art data fusion strategies for predicting BCR. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated improved BCR-free survival prediction for the sMVCCA-fused classifier as compared to histology or proteomic features alone.",Correlation;Feature extraction;Proteomics;Optimization;Prostate cancer;Proteins;Vectors;Data fusion;digital pathology;dimensionality reduction;mass spectrometry;prostate cancer;proteomics,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2014.2355175
Small Blob Identification in Medical Images Using Regional Features From Optimum Scale,"Recent advances in medical imaging technology have greatly enhanced imaging-based diagnosis which requires computational effective and accurate algorithms to process the images (e.g., measure the objects) for quantitative assessment. In this research, we are interested in one type of imaging objects: small blobs. Examples of small blob objects are cells in histopathology images, glomeruli in MR images, etc. This problem is particularly challenging because the small blobs often have inhomogeneous intensity distribution and an indistinct boundary against the background. Yet, in general, these blobs have similar sizes. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel detector termed Hessian-based Laplacian of Gaussian (HLoG) using scale space theory as the foundation. Like most imaging detectors, an image is first smoothed via LoG. Hessian analysis is then launched to identify the single optimal scale on which a presegmentation is conducted. The advantage of the Hessian process is that it is capable of delineating the blobs. As a result, regional features can be retrieved. These features enable an unsupervised clustering algorithm for postpruning which should be more robust and sensitive than the traditional threshold-based postpruning commonly used in most imaging detectors. To test the performance of the proposed HLoG, two sets of 2-D grey medical images are studied. HLoG is compared against three state-of-the-art detectors: generalized LoG, Radial-Symmetry and LoG using precision, recall, and F-score metrics. We observe that HLoG statistically outperforms the compared detectors.",Detectors;Feature extraction;Shape;Materials;Laplace equations;Imaging;Electronic mail;Blob detection;Hessian analysis;Scale space;Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG);Unsupervised learning;Blob detection;Hessian analysis;scale space;Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG);unsupervised learning,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2014.2360154
Towards Large-Scale Histopathological Image Analysis: Hashing-Based Image Retrieval,"Automatic analysis of histopathological images has been widely utilized leveraging computational image-processing methods and modern machine learning techniques. Both computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and content-based image-retrieval (CBIR) systems have been successfully developed for diagnosis, disease detection, and decision support in this area. Recently, with the ever-increasing amount of annotated medical data, large-scale and data-driven methods have emerged to offer a promise of bridging the semantic gap between images and diagnostic information. In this paper, we focus on developing scalable image-retrieval techniques to cope intelligently with massive histopathological images. Specifically, we present a supervised kernel hashing technique which leverages a small amount of supervised information in learning to compress a 10 \thinspace000-dimensional image feature vector into only tens of binary bits with the informative signatures preserved. These binary codes are then indexed into a hash table that enables real-time retrieval of images in a large database. Critically, the supervised information is employed to bridge the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level diagnostic information. We build a scalable image-retrieval framework based on the supervised hashing technique and validate its performance on several thousand histopathological images acquired from breast microscopic tissues. Extensive evaluations are carried out in terms of image classification (i.e., benign versus actionable categorization) and retrieval tests. Our framework achieves about 88.1% classification accuracy as well as promising time efficiency. For example, the framework can execute around 800 queries in only 0.01 s, comparing favorably with other commonly used dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods.",Feature extraction;Semantics;Breast cancer;Image retrieval;Optimization;Kernel;Vectors;Breast lesion;hashing;high dimension;histopathological image analysis;large-scale image retrieval;supervised learning,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2014.2361481
Learning Structured Models for Segmentation of 2-D and 3-D Imagery,"Efficient and accurate segmentation of cellular structures in microscopic data is an essential task in medical imaging. Many state-of-the-art approaches to image segmentation use structured models whose parameters must be carefully chosen for optimal performance. A popular choice is to learn them using a large-margin framework and more specifically structured support vector machines (SSVM). Although SSVMs are appealing, they suffer from certain limitations. First, they are restricted in practice to linear kernels because the more powerful nonlinear kernels cause the learning to become prohibitively expensive. Second, they require iteratively finding the most violated constraints, which is often intractable for the loopy graphical models used in image segmentation. This requires approximation that can lead to reduced quality of learning. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to overcome these limitations. We first introduce a method to “kernelize” the features so that a linear SSVM framework can leverage the power of nonlinear kernels without incurring much additional computational cost. Moreover, we employ a working set of constraints to increase the reliability of approximate subgradient methods and introduce a new way to select a suitable step size at each iteration. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on both 2-D and 3-D electron microscopic (EM) image data and show consistent performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.",Kernel;Labeling;Image segmentation;Training;Support vector machines;Approximation methods;Fasteners;Computer vision;electron microscopy;image processing;image segmentation;kernel methods;mitochondria;segmentation;statistical machine learning;structured prediction;superpixels;supervoxels,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2014.2376274
Tubularity Flow Field—A Technique for Automatic Neuron Segmentation,"A segmentation framework is proposed to trace neurons from confocal microscopy images. With an increasing demand for high throughput neuronal image analysis, we propose an automated scheme to perform segmentation in a variational framework. Our segmentation technique, called tubularity flow field (TuFF) performs directional regional growing guided by the direction of tubularity of the neurites. We further address the problem of sporadic signal variation in confocal microscopy by designing a local attraction force field, which is able to bridge the gaps between local neurite fragments, even in the case of complete signal loss. Segmentation is performed in an integrated fashion by incorporating the directional region growing and the attraction force-based motion in a single framework using level sets. This segmentation is accomplished without manual seed point selection; it is automated. The performance of TuFF is demonstrated over a set of 2D and 3D confocal microscopy images where we report an improvement of >75% in terms of mean absolute error over three extensively used neuron segmentation algorithms. Two novel features of the variational solution, the evolution force and the attraction force, hold promise as contributions that can be employed in a number of image analysis applications.",Image segmentation;Neurons;Vectors;Microscopy;Level set;Force;Shape;Confocal microscopy;neuron tracing;level set;vector field convolution;Confocal microscopy;neuron tracing;level set;vector field convolution,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2014.2378052
Cell Detection From Redundant Candidate Regions Under Nonoverlapping Constraints,"Cell detection in microscopy images is essential for automated cell behavior analysis including cell shape analysis and cell tracking. Robust cell detection in high-density and low-contrast images is still challenging since cells often touch and partially overlap, forming a cell cluster with blurry intercellular boundaries. In such cases, current methods tend to detect multiple cells as a cluster. If the control parameters are adjusted to separate the touching cells, other problems often occur: a single cell may be segmented into several regions, and cells in low-intensity regions may not be detected. To solve these problems, we first detect redundant candidate regions, which include many false positives but in turn very few false negatives, by allowing candidate regions to overlap with each other. Next, the score for how likely the candidate region contains the main part of a single cell is computed for each cell candidate using supervised learning. Then we select an optimal set of cell regions from the redundant regions under nonoverlapping constraints, where each selected region looks like a single cell and the selected regions do not overlap. We formulate this problem of optimal region selection as a binary linear programming problem under nonoverlapping constraints. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for several types of cells in microscopy images. Our method performed better than five representative methods, achieving an F-measure of over 0.9 for all data sets. Experimental application of the proposed method to 3-D images demonstrated that also works well for 3-D cell detection.",Microscopy;Image segmentation;Shape;Linear programming;Indexes;Vectors;Training data;Bioimage informatics;cell detection;microscopy image,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2015.2391095
Pharmacokinetic Tumor Heterogeneity as a Prognostic Biomarker for Classifying Breast Cancer Recurrence Risk,"Goal: Heterogeneity in cancer can affect response to therapy and patient prognosis. Histologic measures have classically been used to measure heterogeneity, although a reliable noninvasive measurement is needed both to establish baseline risk of recurrence and monitor response to treatment. Here, we propose using spatiotemporal wavelet kinetic features from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to quantify intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer. Methods: Tumor pixels are first partitioned into homogeneous subregions using pharmacokinetic measures. Heterogeneity wavelet kinetic (HetWave) features are then extracted from these partitions to obtain spatiotemporal patterns of the wavelet coefficients and the contrast agent uptake. The HetWave features are evaluated in terms of their prognostic value using a logistic regression classifier with genetic algorithm wrapper-based feature selection to classify breast cancer recurrence risk as determined by a validated gene expression assay. Results: Receiver operating characteristic analysis and area under the curve (AUC) are computed to assess classifier performance using leave-one-out cross validation. The HetWave features outperform other commonly used features (AUC = 0.88 HetWave versus 0.70 standard features). The combination of HetWave and standard features further increases classifier performance (AUCs 0.94). Conclusion: The rate of the spatial frequency pattern over the pharmacokinetic partitions can provide valuable prognostic information.  Significance: HetWave could be a powerful feature extraction approach for characterizing tumor heterogeneity, providing valuable prognostic information.",Tumors;Feature extraction;Standards;Wavelet coefficients;Kinetic theory;Breast cancer;Biomedical measurement;Breast DCE-MRI;tumor heterogeneity;partitioning;feature extraction;prognostic assessment;breast cancer recurrence prediction;gene expression;Breast cancer recurrence prediction;breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI);feature extraction;gene expression;partitioning;prognostic assessment;tumor heterogeneity,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2015.2395812
Automated system for malaria parasite identification,"Malaria is a serious worldwide health issue which causes globally an expected 3.4 billion individuals in danger of malaria in 2013. Malaria is an entirely preventable and treatable disease [1]. For fast diagnosis and acute treatment of Malaria is important to reduce the death rate. As the parasite changes morphology in its different life stages and its types varies, an experienced technician is required to identify types of malaria parasites in laboratory diagnosis. Current malaria analysis depends essentially on microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films, this method is time consuming and routine. According to the World Health Organization, it causes more than 1 million deaths arising from approximately 300 to 500 million infections every year [2]. For the proper medication of patient it is important to identify the species.

Partially occluded object detection and counting,"In today's fast-moving life many a pathological labs still use probabilistic approach to count the number of microscopic cells in a sample slide, which is a tedious job and not accurate all the time. The problem of finding the position of objects in an image as well as to count the occurrence of that object in the image is a hitch for the researcher. We have restricted our problem only to completely circular disk shaped objects. Our aim is to accurately calculate the geometrical position of the objects and the object count. Boundaries of the object patches have been extracted using morphological operation and with the help of classical geometry we locate the exact boundary coordinate of the objects. In this paper we propose a new, simple framework for visual object detection and object counting for the image of circular objects, whether these are partially occluded to each other or not.",Equations;Mathematical model;Object detection;Feature extraction;Arrays;Object recognition;Algorithm design and analysis;occulated image;inocculated image;object detection;object counting,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,"Proceedings of the 2015 Third International Conference on Computer, Communication, Control and Information Technology (C3IT)",10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060222
Deformability Measurement of Single-Cells at High-Throughput With Imaging Flow Cytometry,"Disease conditions like malaria, sickle cell anemia, diabetes mellitus, cancer, etc., are known to significantly alter the deformability of certain types of cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, circulating tumor cells, etc.). To determine the cellular deformability, techniques like micropipette aspiration, atomic force microscopy, optical tweezers, quantitative phase imaging have been developed. Many of these techniques have an advantage of determining the single cell deformability with ultrahigh precision. However, the suitability of these techniques for the realization of a deformability based diagnostic tool is questionable as they are expensive and extremely slow to operate on a huge population of cells. In this paper, we propose a technique for high-throughput (800 cells/s) determination of cellular deformability on a single cell basis. This technique involves capturing the image(s) of cells in flow that have undergone deformation under the influence of shear gradient generated by the fluid flowing through the microfluidic channels. Deformability indices of these cells can be computed by performing morphological operations on these images. We demonstrate the applicability of this technique for examining the deformability index on healthy, diabetic, and sphered red blood cells. We believe that this technique has a strong role to play in the realization of a potential tool that uses deformability as one of the important criteria in disease diagnosis.",Diabetes;Imaging;Diseases;Red blood cells;Pathology;Instruments;Throughput;Microfluidics;Cell deformability;Clinical diagnostics;High-throughput imaging;Morphological analysis;Cell deformability;clinical diagnostics;high-throughput imaging;microfluidics;morphological analysis,ARTICLE,2015,Journal of Lightwave Technology,10.1109/JLT.2015.2413834
Novel hybrid hardware architecture for nuclei detection in skin histopathological images,"Histopathological examination is the gold standard for many kinds of cancer diagnosis as the histopathology slides provide a cellular level view of the disease. Computer-aided automated diagnosis techniques have recently been developed based on the analysis of skin histopathological images to diagnose skin cancer. Due to the very high resolution characteristics of the skin whole slide images, the image analysis has high computational complexity. In recent years, FPGA has been widely used to implement and speed up high complexity signal and image processing techniques. In this paper, a MATLAB-FPGA hybrid implementation of the histopathological image analysis technique for nuclei detection in skin whole slide image is proposed.

Clump splitting in Histopathological images based on concave points,This paper proposes a simple approach to split the clumps found in Histopathological Images. Watershed algorithm is generally used to segment and separate the clumps. Several studies have revealed that watershed algorithm suffer drawbacks leading to lesser accuracy in clump splitting.

K-nearest unrepeatable cell graph model of histopathological tissue image,"One of the most important components in the histopathological tissue images is the cell nuclei. Features such as the number, morphological properties and location of the cell nuclei offer useful information for histopathological analysis. Cell-graph models are constructed using location information of cell nuclei and important distinctive information can be obtained from the features of the models. The models are generally formed according to the distance between the cell nuclei. However, the distance between the cell nuclei is affected by various factors during obtaining tissue image and shows variety. In this study, using one-way neighborhood relationship of the nuclei with each other is proposed for the construction of the cell-graph models of histopathological images. The proposed approach has been tested on 20 healthy and 20 necrotic liver tissue images. The results show that graph models constructed by the neighborhood relationship, have more distinctive characteristics than distance-based graph models.",Computational modeling;Imaging;Cancer;Image segmentation;Object oriented modeling;Object segmentation;Liver;Histopathological image analysis;Computer-aided diagnosis;Cell graph modeling;Tissue modeling,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 23nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU),10.1109/SIU.2015.7130414
Mitosis detection on histopathological images using statistical detection algorithms,"In this work, the utility and accuracy of the statistical detection algorithms for the detection of mitosis on histopathological images have been investigated. In the first stage, the subset images involving mitotic cells from the original images have been created. The occurance based texture filters have been applied to each subset image. Then the training/testing dataset has been created from these subset images. Later, the three statistical detection algorithms have been implemented in this work, namely matched filtering (MF), constrained energy minimization (CEM) and adaptive coherence estimator (ACE).

An automated model-based application tried to be developed for the detection of mitosis which is normally difficult to determine even by experts. The main purpose of this study is to assist pathologist in finding mitotic cells as second reader computer aided diagnosis system. On this purpose, firstly, k-means algorithm has been applied to distinguish the cellular structures from noncellular structures. Then, the features of this clustered cellular structures are extracted by using completed local binary pattern (CLBP). Hence, it is aimed to be sure whether the mitotic cells are able to distinguished from nonmitotic cells or not. Finally, an ensemble random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to classify the extracted features by CLBP.

Label-Free Detection of Tumor Angiogenesis Biomarker Angiopoietin 2 Using Bloch Surface Waves on One Dimensional Photonic Crystals,"We describe the design and fabrication of biochips based on 1-D photonic crystals supporting Bloch surface waves for label-free optical biosensing. The optical properties of Bloch surface waves are studied in relation to the geometry of the photonic crystals and on the properties of the dielectric materials used for the fabrication. The planar stacks of the biochips are composed of silica, tantala, and titania that were deposited using plasma-ion-assisted evaporation under high-vacuum conditions. The biochip surfaces were functionalized by silanization, and appropriate fluidic cells were designed to operate in an automated platform. An angularly resolved ellipsometric optical sensing apparatus was assembled to carry out the sensing studies. The angular operation is obtained by a focused laser beam at a fixed wavelength and detection of the angular reflectance spectrum by means of an array detector. The results of the experimental characterization of the physical properties of the fabricated biochips show that their characteristics, in terms of sensitivity and figure of merit, match those expected from the numerical simulations. Practical application of the sensor was demonstrated by detecting a specific glycoprotein, Angio-poietin 2, that is involved in angiogenesis and inflammation processes. The protocol used for the label-free detection of Angiopoietin 2 is described, and the results of an exemplary assay, carried out at a relatively high concentration of 1 μg/ml, are given and confirm that an efficient detection can be achieved.

Digital pathology: Identifying spongiosis in unstained histopathology specimen,"Histopathological specimens are prepped through a process called staining prior to analysis by the pathologist. Staining of a pathological specimen is a standard procedure used to increase the contrast between the cell and tissue structures against the background. Unfortunately, staining is a lengthy process that requires hours of preparation. Moreover, the chemicals used to perform the procedure can affect the specimen's characteristics. The entire problem of staining can be eliminated if detection and diagnosis can be performed on unstained specimen. However the low-contrast unstained samples can seriously affect the diagnosis reliability. Currently, no established technique exists for the detection and diagnosis of unstained histhopathological samples. This project aims to detect and diagnose spongiosis, a type of cerebral edema, in unstained histopathological samples taken from poultry brains. Success of this research is the first step towards detecting various classes of cerebral edema.

Efficient Shape Priors for Spline-Based Snakes,"Parametric active contours are an attractive approach for image segmentation, thanks to their computational efficiency. They are driven by application-dependent energies that reflect the prior knowledge on the object to be segmented. We propose an energy involving shape priors acting in a regularization-like manner. Thereby, the shape of the snake is orthogonally projected onto the space that spans the affine transformations of a given shape prior. The formulation of the curves is continuous, which provides computational benefits when compared with landmark-based (discrete) methods. We show that this approach improves the robustness and quality of spline-based segmentation algorithms, while its computational overhead is negligible.

A joint classification and segmentation approach for dendritic spine segmentation in 2-photon microscopy images,"Shape priors have been successfully used in challenging biomedical imaging problems. However when the shape distribution involves multiple shape classes, leading to a multimodal shape density, effective use of shape priors in segmentation becomes more challenging. In such scenarios, knowing the class of the shape can aid the segmentation process, which is of course unknown a priori. In this paper, we propose a joint classification and segmentation approach for dendritic spine segmentation which infers the class of the spine during segmentation and adapts the remaining segmentation process accordingly. We evaluate our proposed approach on 2-photon microscopy images containing dendritic spines and compare its performance quantitatively to an existing approach based on nonparametric shape priors.

DFDL: Discriminative feature-oriented dictionary learning for histopathological image classification,"In histopathological image analysis, feature extraction for classification is a challenging task due to the diversity of histology features suitable for each problem as well as presence of rich geometrical structure.

Essentially, our Discriminative Feature-oriented Dictionary Learning (DFDL) method learns class-specific features which are suitable for representing samples from the same class while are poorly capable of representing samples from other classes. Experiments on three challenging real-world image databases: 1) histopathological images of intraductal breast lesions, 2) mammalian lung images provided by the Animal Diagnostics Lab (ADL) at Pennsylvania State University, and 3) brain tumor images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, show the significance of DFDL model in a variety problems over state-of-the-art methods.",Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Training;Biomedical imaging;Image analysis;Lungs;Accuracy;Histopathological image classification;Sparse coding;Dictionary learning;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164037
Fusing heterogeneous features for the image-guided diagnosis of intraductal breast lesions,"In the analysis of histopathological images, both holistic (e.g., architecture features) and local appearance features demonstrate excellent performance, while their accuracy may vary dramatically among different inputs. This motivates us to investigate how to fuse results from these features to further enhance the accuracy. Particularly, we employ content-based image retrieval approaches to discover morphologically relevant images for image-guided diagnosis, using both holistic and local features. However, because of the dramatically different characteristics and representations of these heterogenous features, their resulting ranks may have no intersection among the top candidates, causing difficulties for traditional fusion methods. In this paper, we employ graph-based query-specific fusion approach where multiple retrieval ranks are integrated and reordered by conducting link analysis on a fused graph. The proposed method is capable of adaptively combining the strengths of local or holistic features for different queries, and does not need any supervision. We evaluate our method on a challenging clinical problem, i.e., histopathological image-guided diagnosis of intraductal breast lesions, and it achieves 91.67% classification accuracy on 120 breast tissue images from 40 patients.",Accuracy;Image analysis;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Image retrieval;Fuses;Breast;histopathological image analysis;breast lesion;image retrieval;hashing;fusion,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164110
Segmenting subcellular structures in histology tissue images,"Pathologists often rely on features of the subcellular structures, i.e., nucleus and cytoplasm, to differentiate different types of immune cells. Accurate segmentation of the sub-cellular structures can help classify cell types. However, segmentation in histology tissue images is very challenging, due to, intra-class variations and inter-class similarity, complex and crowded background, and noisy data. In this paper, we propose a novel energy minimization framework with constraints, that can easily incorporate various photometric and geometric priors to alleviate such challenges. We also propose a novel layered graph model to solve our energy minimization problem optimally in polynomial time. Experiments on clinical data demonstrate our method obtain better results on both segmentation, and classification of cell types using features extracted from the segmented subcellular structures, than other popular state-of-the-art general segmentation methods.",Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Cells (biology);Plasmas;Image edge detection;Minimization;Bismuth,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163934
Deformable registration of immunofluorescence and histology using iterative cross-modal propagation,"In this work, we cast a multi-modal immunofluorescence to histology registration problem is cast to a mono-modal one by iteratively propagating tissue-specific features from one modality to generate intensities in the other modality via an implicitly learnt random-forest regression framework. The proposed method iterates between modality propagation and image registration in a unified formulation. Evaluations on real and simulated tissue deformations establish superiority of the proposed work over comparative methods in handling highly complex intermodal intensity relationships. This framework will aid in quantitative analysis of the tissue structure, functionality thus providing for co-located molecular validations and bringing in spatial fidelity to histological assessment.",Robustness;Image registration;Imaging;Deformable models;Feature extraction;Immune system;Standards;Modality propagation;deformable registration;histology;immunofluorescence,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163875
Automated neuron morphology reconstruction using fuzzy-logic detection and Bayesian tracing algorithms,"Digital reconstruction of neuronal cell morphology from microscopy image data is an important task in many neuro-science studies. Since the quality of the images is typically low due to noise, imperfect staining, or uneven illumination, and the morphology of neurons can be very complex, reconstruction is often very challenging even for expert human annotators. Many (semi)automatic reconstruction methods have been proposed in recent years, but they are far from perfect, and the challenge remains to develop better methods. Here we introduce a new fully automatic neuron reconstruction method that combines fuzzy-logic based detection of critical points in the images and Bayesian probabilistic tracing between these points. The method was tested on 2D fluorescence microscopy images of real single neurons with corresponding manual annotations. Our method proves to be more accurate (smaller median error) and substantially more robust (smaller error variance) compared to an alternative state-of-the-art method based on all-path pruning.",Neurons;Image reconstruction;Bayes methods;Microscopy;Morphology;Junctions;Image segmentation;Neuron reconstruction;Bayesian filtering;fuzzy logic;fluorescence microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164012
Cell segmentation and tracking in phase contrast images using graph cut with asymmetric boundary costs,"We propose a new robust, effective, and surprisingly simple approach for the segmentation of cells in phase contrast microscopy images. The key feature of our algorithm is that it strongly favors dark-to-bright transitions at the boundaries of the (arbitrarily shaped) segmentation mask. The segmentation mask can be effectively found by a fast min-cut approach. The small but essential difference to standard min-cut based approaches is that our graph contains directed edges with asymmetric edge weights. Combined with a simple region propagation our approach yields better segmentation results on the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge 2014 dataset than the top ranked methods. We provide an easy-to-use open-source implementation for ImageJ/Fiji and Matlab on our homepage.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image edge detection;Standards;World Wide Web;MATLAB;Training;cell segmentation;cell tracking;phase contrast microscopy;graph-cut;min-cut;asymmetric boundary costs,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164093
Spoke-LBP and ring-LBP: New texture features for tissue classification,"This paper proposes a texture feature which is applied on human breast Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM) images to classify different types of breast tissues. Inspired by local binary pattern (LBP) texture features, a new variant of LBP feature, block based LBP (BLBP) is proposed. Instead of representing intensity differences between neighbors and a center pixel, BLBP feature extracts the intensity differences among certain blocks of the neighborhood around a pixel. Two different ways are proposed to organize the blocks: the spokes and the rings. By integrating spoke BLBP with ring BLBP features, very high classification accuracy is achieved using a neural network classifier. In one of our experiments which classifies 4310 OCM images into five tissue types, the classification accuracy increased from 81.7% to 92.4% when new features are used instead of the traditional LBP feature. In another experiment which classifies 46 large field OCM images as either benign or containing tumor, a classification accuracy of 91.3% is reached by using multi-scale BLBP features.",Feature extraction;Accuracy;Tumors;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Breast tissue;Coherence;Texture feature;Local Binary Pattern (LBP);Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM);Tissue classification;Tumor detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163848
Cell segmentation and classification by hierarchical supervised shape ranking,"While pathologists can readily elucidate disease-relevant information from tissue images, automated algorithms may fail to capture the intricate details of complex biological specimens. As histology patterns vary depending on different tissue types, it is typically necessary to adapt and optimize segmentation algorithms to specific applications. To address this, we present a supervised machine learning method we call Support Vector Shape Segmentation (SVSS) to enhance and improve more general segmentation methods by utilizing a cell shape ranking function. First, we pose shape segmentation as an optimization problem that maximizes shape similarity with respect to the specific shape classes. Secondly, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to solve the multi-scale segmentation problem in a minimum number of steps. The main advantage of the approach is that it naturally induces a ranking measure given the set of shape exemplars. We demonstrate large-scale quantitative and qualitative results on epithelial cells in a range of tissue types.",Shape;Image segmentation;Shape measurement;Lungs;Biological tissues;Support vector machines,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164112
Predictive sparse morphometric context for classification of histology sections,"Classification of histology sections from large cohorts, in terms of distinct regions of microanatomy (e.g., tumor, stroma, normal), enables the quantification of tumor composition, and the construction of predictive models of the clinical outcome. To tackle the batch effects and biological heterogeneities that are persistent in large cohorts, sparse cellular morphometric context has recently been developed for invariant representation of the underlying properties in the data, which summarizes cellular morphometric features at various locations and scales, and leads to a system with superior performance for classification of microanatomy and histopathology. However, the sparse optimization protocol for the calculation of sparse cellular morphometric features is not scalable for large scale classification. To improve the scalability of systems, based on sparse morphometric context, we propose the predictive sparse morphometric context in place of the original implementation, which approximates the sparse cellular morphometric feature through a non-linear regressor that is jointly learned with an over-complete dictionary in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results indicates over 50 times speedup compared to our previous implementation with the help of non-linear regressor; while producing competitive performance.",Tumors;Context;Feature extraction;Kernel;Training;Optimization;Encoding;Classification;Sparse Coding;H&E Tissue Section,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164040
Nuclei segmentation via sparsity constrained convolutional regression,"Automated profiling of nuclear architecture, in histology sections, can potentially help predict the clinical outcomes. However, the task is challenging as a result of nuclear pleomorphism and cellular states (e.g, cell fate, cell cycle), which are compounded by the batch effect (e.g, variations in fixation and staining). Present methods, for nuclear segmentation, are based on human-designed features that may not effectively capture intrinsic nuclear architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called sparsity constrained convolutional regression (SCCR), for nuclei segmentation. Specifically, given raw image patches and the corresponding annotated binary masks, our algorithm jointly learns a bank of convolutional filters and a sparse linear regressor, where the former is used for feature extraction, and the latter aims to produce a likelihood for each pixel being nuclear region or background. During classification, the pixel label is simply determined by a thresholding operation applied on the likelihood map. The method has been evaluated using the benchmark dataset collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional nuclei segmentation algorithms and is able to achieve competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm built upon human-designed features with biological prior knowledge.",Image segmentation;Training;Computer vision;Feature extraction;Bioinformatics;Computer architecture;Biology;Nuclear/Background classification;con-volutional neural network;sparse coding;H&E tissue section,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164109
Cells detection using segmentation competition,In this paper we address the problem of cells detection from microscopy images. We construct a dictionary of candidate shapes obtained from previous segmentation maps and define an energy function to select the best candidates. The energy minimization is performed by an iterative graph cut algorithm. The proposed approach optimally combines the segmentation maps obtained with different methods and/or parameters. We show on synthetic and real data that this process allows to drastically improve the performance of each individual segmentation.,Shape;Image segmentation;Dictionaries;Minimization;Microscopy;Skeleton;Tumors;Cells detection;Segmentation;Graph Cut,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164090
Cell pairings for ascidian embryo registration,"Recent microscopy techniques allow imaging temporal 3D stacks of developing organs or embryos with a cellular level of resolution and with a sufficient acquisition frequency to accurately track cell lineages. Imaging multiple organs or embryos in different experimental conditions may help decipher the impact of genetic backgrounds and environmental inputs on the developmental program. For this, we need to precisely compare distinct individuals and to compute population statistics. The first step of this procedure is to develop methods to register individuals. From a previous work of cell segmentation from microscopy images, we here demonstrate how to extract the symmetry plane of embryos at early stages, and how to use this information as a geometrical constraint to both register these embryos and obtain a cell-to-cell mapping.",Embryo;Image segmentation;Registers;Microscopy;Tensile stress;Estimation;Fluorescence microscopy;symmetry detection;embryogenesis;cell-to-cell mapping,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163872
Multi-atlas synthesis for computer assisted diagnosis: Application to cardiovascular diseases,"Atlas-based analysis methods rely on the morphological similarity between the atlas and target images, and on the availability of labelled images. Problems can arise when the deformations introduced by pathologies affect the similarity between the atlas and a patient's image. The aim of this work is to exploit the morphological dissimilarities between atlas databases and pathological images to diagnose the underlying clinical condition, while avoiding the dependence on labelled images. To this end, the proposed method is formulated under the principle of atlas-based segmentation but, instead of propagating labels, we propagate image intensities. Using a set of MR atlas databases, each database associated with a clinical condition, synthetic images are generated for a target image. The diagnosis is established by assessing the degree of similarity between the synthetic images and the target and assigning the condition of the top-ranked synthetic image. The obtained results are comparable to state-of-the-art methods using annotated images, with an accuracy of 90.0% when evaluated on a set of 60 whole heart MR images containing healthy and pathological subjects.",Databases;Image segmentation;Pathology;Design automation;Heart;Biomedical imaging;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computer-aided diagnosis;image synthesis;MR;heart,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163870
Multiscale tensor anisotropic filtering of fluorescence microscopy for denoising microvasculature,"Fluorescence microscopy images are contaminated by noise and improving image quality without blurring vascular structures by filtering is an important step in automatic image analysis. The application of interest here is to automatically extract the structural components of the microvascular system with accuracy from images acquired by fluorescence microscopy. A robust denoising process is necessary in order to extract accurate vascular morphology information. For this purpose, we propose a multiscale tensor with anisotropic diffusion model which progressively and adaptively updates the amount of smoothing while preserving vessel boundaries accurately. Based on a coherency enhancing flow with planar confidence measure and fused 3D structure information, our method integrates multiple scales for microvasculature preservation and noise removal membrane structures. Experimental results on simulated synthetic images and epifluorescence images show the advantage of our improvement over other related diffusion filters. We further show that the proposed multiscale integration approach improves de-noising accuracy of different tensor diffusion methods to obtain better microvasculature segmentation.",Tensile stress;Microscopy;Noise reduction;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Image segmentation;Noise measurement;Noise;Fluorescence;microscopy;anisotropic filtering;multiscale;vasculature;denoising,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163930
Hierarchical task-driven feature learning for tumor histology,"Through learning small and large-scale image features, we can capture the local and architectural structure of tumor tissue from histology images. This is done by learning a hierarchy of dictionaries using sparse coding, where each level captures progressively larger scale and more abstract properties. By optimizing the dictionaries further using class labels, discriminating properties of classes that are not easily visually distinguishable to pathologists are captured. We explore this hierarchical and task-driven model in classifying malignant melanoma and the genetic subtype of breast tumors from histology images. We also show how interpreting our model through visualizations can provide insight to pathologists.",Dictionaries;Malignant tumors;Encoding;Accuracy;Logistics;Image coding;histology;tumor;image classification;feature learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164039
A probabilistic framework for simultaneous segmentation and classification of multiple cells in multi-marker microscopy images,"Segmentation and classification of cells in biological data are important problems in bio-medical image analysis. This paper outlines a novel probabilistic approach to simultaneously classify and segment multiple cells of different classes in a multi-variate setting. Superpixels are extracted from the input vector-valued image, and a 2D hidden Markov model (HMM) is set up on the superpixel graph. HMM emission probabilities are used to ensure high confidence in local class selection based on superpixel feature vectors. Spatial consistency of labels is enforced by proper choice of transition probabilities, which are conditioned on the feature vectors of neighboring superpixels at each location. Optimal superpixel-level class labels are inferred using the HMM, and are aggregated to obtain global multiple object segmentation. The performance is demonstrated on a challenging microscopy dataset. Experiments show, both quantitatively and qualitatively, that the proposed approach effectively segments and classifies cells, outperforming related techniques.",Hidden Markov models;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Accuracy;Probabilistic logic;Iterative decoding;Conferences;Cell segmentation;cell classification;molecular marker;microscopy;multi-variate,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164094

We formulate a novel corner potential that enables the accurate segmentation of objects exhibiting sharp tips or acute angles.

Identifying histological concepts on basal cell carcinoma images using nuclei based sampling and multi-scale descriptors,"Histopathological sample examination involves a sequential analysis of several fields of view (FoV) at different magnification levels. Experts integrate this information by implicitly fusing morphometric and spatial features, mainly related with cell appearance, spatial distribution and organization. By performing this analysis a pathologist recognizes several micro structures such as follicle, epidermis, carcinoma and eccrine glands in basal skin tissue samples. In this article we present a new approach to histopathology classification using a multi-scale nuclei descriptor, located at a set of detected nuclei and constructed as a multiresolution pyramid. The method was evaluated in a multiclass challenging problem, i.e, identifying epidermis, hair follicle, eccrine glands and nodular carcinoma in 240 histopathology images of basal cell carcinoma.

Mitosis Detection for Invasive Breast Cancer Grading in Histopathological Images,"Histopathological grading of cancer not only offers an insight to the patients' prognosis but also helps in making individual treatment plans. Mitosis counts in histopathological slides play a crucial role for invasive breast cancer grading using the Nottingham grading system. Pathologists perform this grading by manual examinations of a few thousand images for each patient. Hence, finding the mitotic figures from these images is a tedious job and also prone to observer variability due to variations in the appearances of the mitotic cells. We propose a fast and accurate approach for automatic mitosis detection from histopathological images. We employ area morphological scale space for cell segmentation. The scale space is constructed in a novel manner by restricting the scales with the maximization of relative-entropy between the cells and the background. This results in precise cell segmentation. The segmented cells are classified in mitotic and non-mitotic category using the random forest classifier. Experiments show at least 12% improvement in F1 score on more than 450 histopathological images at 40× magnification.","Entropy;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Shape;Breast cancer;Manuals;Mitosis detection,;breast cancer grading;relative-entropy maximization;area morphology;scale space;Mitosis detection;breast cancer grading;relative-entropy maximization;area morphology;scale space",ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2015.2460455
Interactive Segmentation Relabeling for Classification of Whole-Slide Histopathology Imagery,"Collecting ground-truth or gold standard annotations from expert pathologists for developing histopathology analytic algorithms and computer-aided diagnosis for cancer grading is an expensive and time consuming process. Efficient visualization and annotation tools are needed to enable ground-truthing large whole-slide imagery. KOLAM is our scalable, cross-platform framework for interactive visualization of 2D, 2D+t and 3D imagery of high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. In the current work KOLAM has been extended to support rapid interactive labelling and correction of automatic image classifier-based region labels of the tissue microenvironment by pathologists. Besides annotating regions-of-interest (ROIs), KOLAM enables extraction of the corresponding large polygonal image subregions for input into automatic segmentation algorithms, single-click region label reassignment and maintaining hierarchical image subregions. Experience indicates that clinicians prefer simple-to-use interfaces that support rapid labelling of large image regions with minimal effort. The incorporation of easy-to-use tissue annotation features in KOLAM makes it an attractive candidate for integration within a multi-stage histopathology image analysis pipeline supporting assisted segmentation and labelling to improve whole-slide imagery (WSI) analytics.",Image segmentation;Data visualization;Pathology;Biomedical imaging;Training;Image resolution;Testing;histopathology;tissue microenvironment;interactive segmentation;whole-slide imagery;supervised classification;visualization,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems,10.1109/CBMS.2015.89

Firstly, morphological characteristics of algae of microscopic imaging are treated. The image processing lead to the identification the genus of aquatic organisms and compared to a morphologic data base.

Development of an Immunosensor Based on Layered Double Hydroxides for MMR Cancer Biomarker Detection,"As a potential biomarker for the investigation of cancer inflammatory profiles, macrophage mannose receptor (MMR, CD206) is herein selected to develop an immunosensor based on layered double hydroxide (LDH). Like an endocyte C-type lectin receptor, MMR plays an important role in immune homeostasis by scavenging unwanted mannose glycoproteins. It attracts a progressive attention thanks to its particularly high expression within the tumor microenvironment. There is a great of interest to develop an immunosensor based on an antibody specific to MMR for detection of stroma versus tumor cells. In this work, we studied the feasibility of high sensitive MMR cancer Screen Printed Electrode (SPE) immunosensor. Working electrode of commercialized SPE was modified by immobilization of specific antibody (anti-MMR) into thin layer of LDH nanomaterials. Structural, morphological, and surface properties of LDHs were studied by X-Ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and Infrared spectroscopy in ATR. Cyclic Voltammetry technique was used to study interaction between the human recombinant MMR protein (rHu-MMR, NSO derived) and an immobilized antibody into developed immunosensor. High specific response of -11.72 μA/ng·mL-1 (with a correlation coefficient of R2=0.994) were obtained in linear range of 0.05 ng/mL to 10.0 ng/mL of specific recombinant antigen. The limit of detection (LOD) was less than 15.0 pg/mL. From these attractive results, the feasibility of an electrochemical immunosensor for cancer was proved.

Sleep Well: A Sound Sleep Monitoring Framework for Community Scaling,"Following healthy lifestyle is a key for active living. Regular exercise, controlled diet and sound sleep play an invisible role on the well being and independent living of the people. Sleep being the most durative activities of daily living (ADL) has a major synergistic influence on people's mental, physical and cognitive health. Understanding the sleep behavior longitudinally and its underpinning clausal relationships with physiological signals and contexts (such as eye or body movement etc.) horizontally responsible for a sound or disruptive sleep pattern help provide meaningful information for promoting healthy lifestyle and designing appropriate intervention strategy. In this paper we propose to detect the microscopic states of the sleep which fundamentally constitute the components of a good or bad sleeping behavior and help shape the formative assessment of sleep quality. We initially investigate several classification techniques to identify and correlate the relationship of microscopic sleep states with the overall sleep behavior. Subsequently we propose an online algorithm based on change point detection to better process and classify the microscopic sleep states and then test a lightweight version of this algorithm for real time sleep monitoring activity recognition and assessment at scale. For a larger deployment of our proposed model across a community of individuals we propose an active learning based methodology by reducing the effort of ground truth data collection.

Biomedical Big Data Analytics for Patient-Centric and Outcome-Driven Precision Health,"Rapid advancements in biotechnologies such as -omic (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics etc.), next generation sequencing, bio-nanotechnologies, molecular imaging, and mobile sensors etc. accelerate the data explosion in biomedicine and health wellness. Multiple nations around the world have been seeking novel effective ways to make sense of ""big data"" for evidence-based, outcome-driven, and affordable 5P (Patient-centric, Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Precise) healthcare. My main research focus is on multi-modal and multi-scale (i.e. molecular, cellular, whole body, individual, and population) biomedical data analytics for discovery, development, and delivery, including translational bioinformatics in biomarker discovery for personalized care; imaging informatics in histopathology for clinical diagnosis decision support; bionanoinformatics for minimally-invasive image-guided surgery; critical care informatics in ICU for real-time evidence-based decision making; and chronic care informatics for patient-centric health. In this talk, first, I will highlight major challenges in biomedical and health informatics pipeline consisting of data quality control, information feature extraction, advanced knowledge modeling, decision making, and proper action taking through feedback. Second, I will present informatics methodological research in (i) data integrity and integration; (ii) case-based reasoning for individualized care; and (iii) streaming data analytics for real-time decision support using a few mobile health case studies (e.g. Sickle Cell Disease, asthma, pain management, rehabilitation, diabetes etc.). Last, there is big shortage of data scientists and engineers who are capable of handling Big Data. In addition, there is an urgent need to educate healthcare stakeholders (i.e. patients, physicians, payers, and hospitals) on how to tackle these grant challenges.

Towards an Endpoint Cell Motility Assay by a Microfluidic Platform,"In vitro cell motility assays are frequently used in the study of cell migration in response to anti-cancer drug treatment. Microfluidic systems represent a unique tool for the in vitro analysis of cell motility. However, they usually rely on using time-lapse microscopy to record the spatial temporal locations of the individual cells being tested. This has created a bottleneck for microfluidic systems to perform high-throughput experiments due to requirement of a costly time-lapse microscopy system. Here, we describe the development of a portable microfluidic device for endpoint analysis of cell motility. The reported device incorporates a cell alignment feature to position the seeded cells on the same initial location, so that the cells' motilities can be analyzed based on their locations at the end of the experiment after the cells have migrated. We show that the device was able to assess cancer cell motility after treatment with a migration inhibitory drug Indole-3-carbinol on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, demonstrating the applicability of our device in screening anti-cancer drug compounds on cancer cells.",Microfluidics;Cancer;Drugs;Microscopy;Reservoirs;Nanobioscience;Electron tubes;Biological technique;cancer;cells (biology);microfluidics,ARTICLE,2015,IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience,10.1109/TNB.2015.2455537
Automated detection of toxicity in the blood samples of dye factory workers,"Textile processing units largely employ azo dyes which are derivatives of benzene. Toxic sewage discharged from textile industries contains azo dyes. They affect soil fertility, water resources, marine organisms and the ecosystem. Benzedine is responsible for skin irritation and also increases the toxicity in blood and bone marrow which affects the production of blood cells and hence leads to anemia. Exposure to these benzedine dyes can induce hemolytic anemia which leads to deformation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). In this work, an automated detection of toxicity is proposed to alert the workers prior to the critical stages of cancer. The proposed system consists of a portable unit where the blood samples are analyzed and the toxic status of the dye factory workers can be transmitted from the local health centre to the nearby hospital. Microscopic images of the smeared blood samples are acquired using the digital microscope. These RBC images of normal and abnormal are segmented using Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) segmentation. Geometric shape based features are extracted from the segmented images. Significant geometric features are chosen by conducting student's `t' test. It is observed from the results that these significant geometric features show discrimination between the normal and abnormal RBCs. This early detection of toxicity can help workers in the site to take immediate medication which could reduce the probability of adversity in their health condition.",Image segmentation;Blood;Shape;Feature extraction;Cancer;Microscopy;Textiles;Carcinogenic azo dyes;Red blood cell;Laplacian of Gaussian;Geometric features;Student's ‘t’ test,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 International Conference on Computing and Communications Technologies (ICCCT),10.1109/ICCCT2.2015.7292771
Lung tissue evaluation detecting and measuring morphological characteristics of cell regions,"The goal of this study is to develop an automated, accurate and time efficient image processing algorithmic scheme, capable of segmenting lung tissue slides and quantitatively detecting any possible morphological characteristic that may differentiate healthy cells from adenocarcinoma. Microscopy images are segmented into the key regions via a proposed clever, sequential fusion methodology, combining image clustering, the watershed transform and mathematical morphology and analyzed utilizing an innovative tissue evaluation approach based on quantitative assessments of the extracted cell regions shape and size. The preliminary results of this work indicate that it is possible to discriminate healthy cells from cancerous ones considering their overall morphology within the tissue and measuring possible indices that may reveal an evolving neoplasia, a tumor growth or a malfunction in cell proliferation.

Effects of probe placement on tissue oxygenation levels during reflectance measurements for different types of tissues in a clinical setting,Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) have been investigated as an alternate technique to tissue histopathology for the early detection of premalignant lesions in a wide variety of tissues. Spectroscopic techniques require a fiber optic probe to be kept in contact with a biological tissue at an optimal distance to illuminate and receive light during spectral measurements. This probe-contact pressure introduces artifacts in optical properties depending on the biological and morphological status of the tissue. The objective of this investigation is to study the effects of probe pressure on different types of tissues with varying anatomical structures on tissue oxygenation levels during reflectance measurements.,Probes;Biomedical optical imaging;Spectroscopy;Pressure measurement;Biomedical measurement;Optical scattering;Adaptive optics;diffuse reflectance spectroscopy;in vivo diagnosis;probe pressure,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 International Conference on BioPhotonics (BioPhotonics),10.1109/BioPhotonics.2015.7304034
Subimage Cosegmentation in a Single White Blood Cell Image,"As one of the most basic and key steps in the white blood cell (WBC) automatic recognition system, the accuracy and stability of WBC segmentation greatly affect the recognition accuracy of the whole system. Inspired by co segmentation, this paper presents a new method to obtain the entire WBC contour in order to solve the adhesion problem. Firstly, the color space transformation and thresholding are employed to obtain sub images. Among them, a sub image called reference image only includes plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), while the others contain WBCs. Then, a similarity measurement is introduced into the region-based active contour model in order to co segment between the reference image and the other sub images. Due to full use of cross information, such as color and shape, the proposed method has been successfully applied to a large number of microscopic cell images, showing promising segmentation results for diverse cell appearance and image quality.",Image segmentation;Active contours;Image color analysis;Deformable models;Microscopy;White blood cells;Accuracy;White blood cell;Cosegmentation;Region-based active contour model,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,"2015 7th International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks",10.1109/CICSyN.2015.36
Circulating tumor cells classification and characterization in dark field microscopic images of unstained blood,"To date, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are the most promising tumor marker. They correlate with overall survival rate and disease free survival, allowing an early detection of metastatic process, monitoring the disease progression and the treatment response. Different from most state of the art methods that detect CTC's in stained blood, the aim of this paper is to identify CTCs in unstained blood in order to accomplish the conditions for long term monitoring. Thus, our approach is to find the best features that characterize CTCs and discriminate them from other blood cells in dark field microscopic images. Several classic texture features, such as histogram statistics, gray level co-occurrence matrix and gray tone difference matrix, were proposed as cell descriptors. In addition, we introduce new features that quantify the radial homogeneity of the cells. The study was performed for three types of cells: red cells, white cells and CTCs. The images in our study were acquired with a microscope in dark field (DF) mode at 10X and 20X optical magnification. Several classifier were designed based on the computed features. The performance of each type of feature was tested, and ranked. Final classification results are given by a simplified set of features that improve the quality of the classifiers. The accuracy of our results is over 98% for the cell classification in both optical magnifications.",Blood;Histograms;Microscopy;Cells (biology);Feature extraction;Tumors;Standards;Circulating tumor cells;feature extraction;radial profile;cell classification;dark field,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP),10.1109/ICCP.2015.7312686
Differential evolution based advised SVM for histopathalogical image analysis for skin cancer detection,"Automated detection of cancerous tissue in histopathological images is a big challenge. This work proposed a new pattern recognition method for histopathological image analysis for identification of cancerous tissues. It comprised of feature extraction using a combination of wavelet and intensity based statistical features and autoregressive parameters. Moreover, differential evolution based feature selection is used for dimensionality reduction and an efficient self-advised version of support vector machine is used for evaluation of selected features and for the classification of images.

Texture analysis for colorectal tumour biopsies using multispectral imagery,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. As part of its diagnosis, a histological analysis is often run on biopsy samples. Multispecral imagery taken from cancer tissues can be useful to capture more meaningful features. However, the resulting data is usually very large having a large number of varying feature types. This papers aims to investigate and compare the performances of multispectral imagery taken from colorectal biopsies using different techniques for texture feature extraction inclduing local binary patterns, Haraclick features and local intensity order patterns. Various classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest are also investigated. The results show the superiority of multispectral imaging over the classical panchromatic approach. In the multispectral imagery's analysis, the local binary patterns combined with Support Vector Machine classifier gives very good results achieving an accuracy of 91.3%.",Feature extraction;Cancer;Support vector machines;Accuracy;Radio frequency;Tumors;Databases,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320057
Efficient segmentation of skin epidermis in whole slide histopathological images,"Segmentation of epidermis areas is an important step towards automatic analysis of skin histopathological images. This paper presents a robust technique for epidermis segmentation in whole slide skin histopathological images. The proposed technique first performs a coarse epidermis segmentation using global thresholding and shape analysis. The epidermis thickness is then estimated by a series of line segments perpendicular to the main axis of the initially segmented epidermis mask. If the segmented epidermis mask has a thickness greater than a predefined threshold, the segmentation is suspected to be inaccurate. A second pass of fine segmentation using k-means algorithm is then carried out over these coarsely segmented result to enhance the performance. Experimental results on 64 different skin histopathological images show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance compared to the existing techniques.",Epidermis;Image segmentation;Dermis;Thickness measurement;Shape;Skeleton,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319235
Automatic segmentation of lymph vessel wall using optimal surface graph cut and hidden Markov Models,"We present a novel method to segment the lymph vessel wall in confocal microscopy images using Optimal Surface Segmentation (OSS) and hidden Markov Models (HMM). OSS is used to preform a pre-segmentation on the images, to act as the initial state for the HMM. We utilize a steerable filter to determine edge based filters for both of these segmentations, and use these features to build Gaussian probability distributions for both the vessel walls and the background. From this we infer the emission probability for the HMM, and the transmission probability is learned using a Baum-Welch algorithm. We transform the segmentation problem into one of cost minimization, with each node in the graph corresponding to one state, and the weight for each node being defined using its emission probability. We define the inter-relations between neighboring nodes using the transmission probability. Having constructed the problem, it is solved using the Viterbi algorithm, allowing the vessel to be reconstructed. The optimal solution can be found in polynomial time. We present qualitative and quantitative analysis to show the performance of the proposed method.",Hidden Markov models;Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Biomedical imaging;Microscopy;Yttrium;Image edge detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318878
Robust supervised segmentation of neuropathology whole-slide microscopy images,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by brain pathological aggregates such as Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles which trigger neuroinflammation and participate to neuronal loss. Quantification of these pathological markers on histological sections is widely performed to study the disease and to evaluate new therapies. However, segmentation of neuropathology images presents difficulties inherent to histology (presence of debris, tissue folding, non-specific staining) as well as specific challenges (sparse staining, irregular shape of the lesions). Here, we present a supervised classification approach for the robust pixel-level classification of large neuropathology whole slide images. We propose a weighted form of Random Forest in order to fit nonlinear decision boundaries that take into account class imbalance. Both color and texture descriptors were used as predictors and model selection was performed via a leave-one-image-out cross-validation scheme. Our method showed superior results compared to the current state of the art method when applied to the segmentation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in a human brain sample. Furthermore, using parallel computing, our approach easily scales-up to large gigabyte-sized images. To show this, we segmented a whole brain histology dataset of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. This demonstrates our method relevance as a routine tool for whole slide microscopy images analysis in clinical and preclinical research settings.",Image segmentation;Alzheimer's disease;Image color analysis;Gabor filters;Computational modeling;Robustness,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319234
Detection of blur artifacts in histopathological whole-slide images of endomyocardial biopsies,"Histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) have emerged as an objective and quantitative means for image-based disease diagnosis. However, WSIs may contain acquisition artifacts that affect downstream image feature extraction and quantitative disease diagnosis. We develop a method for detecting blur artifacts in WSIs using distributions of local blur metrics. As features, these distributions enable accurate classification of WSI regions as sharp or blurry. We evaluate our method using over 1000 portions of an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) WSI. Results indicate that local blur metrics accurately detect blurry image regions.",Measurement;Histograms;Image edge detection;Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Accuracy,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318465
Robust automatic breast cancer staging using a combination of functional genomics and image-omics,"Breast cancer is one of the leading cancers worldwide. Precision medicine is a new trend that systematically examines molecular and functional genomic information within each patient's cancer to identify the patterns that may affect treatment decisions and potential outcomes. As a part of precision medicine, computer-aided diagnosis enables joint analysis of functional genomic information and image from pathological images. In this paper we propose an integrated framework for breast cancer staging using image-omics and functional genomic information. The entire biomedical imaging informatics framework consists of image-omics extraction, feature combination, and classification. First, a robust automatic nuclei detection and segmentation is presented to identify tumor regions, delineate nuclei boundaries and calculate a set of image-based morphological features; next, the low dimensional image-omics is obtained through principal component analysis and is concatenated with the functional genomic features identified by a linear model. A support vector machine for differentiating stage I breast cancer from other stages are learned. We experimentally demonstrate that compared with a single type of representation (image-omics), the combination of image-omics and functional genomic feature can improve the classification accuracy by 3%.",Genomics;Bioinformatics;Breast cancer;Feature extraction;Tumors;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320059
Automated segmentation of regions of interest in whole slide skin histopathological images,"In the diagnosis of skin melanoma by analyzing histopathological images, the epidermis and epidermis-dermis junctional areas are regions of interest as they provide the most important histologic diagnosis features. This paper presents an automated technique for segmenting epidermis and dermis regions from whole slide skin histopathological images. The proposed technique first performs epidermis segmentation using a thresholding and thickness measurement based method. The dermis area is then segmented based on a predefined depth of segmentation from the epidermis outer boundary. Experimental results on 66 different skin images show that the proposed technique can robustly segment regions of interest as desired.",Image segmentation;Epidermis;Dermis;Malignant tumors;Thickness measurement;Image color analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319238
Computer aided analysis of prostate histopathology images Gleason grading especially for Gleason score 7,"Clinically, prostate adenocarcinoma is diagnosed by recognizing certain morphology on histology. While the Gleason grading system has been shown to be the strongest prognostic factor for men with prostrate adenocarcinoma, there is a significant intra and interobserver variability between pathologists in assigning this grading system. In this study, we present a new method for prostate gland segmentation from which we then utilize to develop a computer aided Gleason grading. The novelty of our method is a region-based nuclei segmentation to get individual gland without using lumen as prior information. Because each gland region is surrounded by nuclei, individual gland can be segmented by using the structure features and Delaunay Triangulation. The precision, recal and F1 of this approach are 0.94±0.11, 0.60±0.23 and 0.70±0.19 respectively.

Inferring intra-cellular mechanics using geometric metamorphosis: A preliminary study,"Mechanotransduction plays an important role in sub-cellular processes and is an active area of research. Determining the forces/strains that the intra-cellular structures experience is vital for developing quantitative models of cellular behavior. Established techniques such as traction force microscopy, digital image correlation etc. track surface forces and kinematics of intra-cellular structures. However, difficulties arise when cells cannot be seeded on micro-patterned substrates or the intra-cellular structures vary (unstable landmarks). Here, we applied geometric metamorphosis, a global image registration method, to determine the kinematic profile of a cell during cell division. The method does not require stable landmarks, the registration is non-local in nature and constraints such as volume conservation can be enforced. The cell wall was tracked over time and a sequence of transformations relating the cell wall at the start of cytokinesis to the configuration prior to the daughters completely separate was determined. These transformations are associated with a scalar metric and a statistical atlas describing the wall kinematics from multiple tracking's of the wall shape is constructed. Using these transformations, the cellular kinematics can be described using a Lagrangian frame of reference and the evolution of a material point property can be easily modeled. To demonstrate this, we use the kinematic data derived from the atlas along with a model of stress-fiber (de)formation dynamics to simulate the stress-fiber configuration as the cell domain deforms.",Strain;Kinematics;Biological system modeling;Shape;Stress;Microscopy;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318508
Exploring automatic prostate histopathology image gleason grading via local structure modeling,"Gleason-grading of prostate cancer pathology specimens reveal the malignancy of the cancer tissues, thus provides critical guidance for prostate cancer diagnoses and treatment. Computer-aided automatic grading methods have been providing efficient and result-consistent alternative to traditional manually slide reading approach, through statistical and structural feature analysis of the digitized pathology slides. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic Gleason grading algorithm through local structure model learning and classification. We use attributed graph to represent the tissue glandular structures in histopathology images; representative sub-graphs features were learned as bags-of-words features from labeled samples of each grades. Then structural similarity between sub-graphs in the unlabeled images and the representative sub-graphs were obtained using the learned codebook. Gleason grade was given based on an overall similarity score. We validated the proposed algorithm on 300 prostate histopathology images from the TCGA dataset, and the algorithm achieved average grading accuracy of 91.25%, 76.36% and 64.75% on images with Gleason grade 3, 4 and 5 respectively.",Image segmentation;Accuracy;Prostate cancer;Pathology;Feature extraction;Algorithm design and analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318936
Viability diagnosis in biotechnological cultures through image processing,"This work evaluates the possibility of measuring the biomass concentration and diagnosing the cell viability in non-stained cultures of yeast cells through image processing techniques. The algorithm presented in this study is validated on Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. It processes the images acquired off-line on a bright field microscope, in order to enhance the features of the cells, to assess the viability and to estimate the biomass concentration. The enhancement method consists of the following operations: image contrast adjustment, noise reduction, image segmentation, cell recognition and labeling, determination of biomass concentration, recognition and counting of living cells, determining of the biomass concentration. The feature enhancement helps the human operator to better see the living cells, but the viability and concentration can be estimated independent of the operator.

In this research, we were seeking for methods of systematically analyzing the PA measurement from biological tissues and the feasibility of evaluating tissue chemical and microstructural features for potential tissue characterization. By performing PA scan over a broad spectrum covering the optical fingerprints of specific relevant chemical components, and then transforming the radio-frequency signals into the frequency domain, a 2D spectrogram, namely physio-chemical spectrogram (PCS) can be generated. The PCS contains rich diagnostic information allowing quantification of not only contents but also histological microfeatures of various chemical components in tissue.

Optical and acoustic observation of photodisruption in two liquid perfluorocarbons induced by nanosecond laser,"Photodisruption can be used to generate microbubble or microbubbles in vivo, thus has potential as an important tool in theranostics. However, high laser intensity and extremely short pulse length in femtosecond, and thus the high cost limit its wide applications. In the study, photodisruption induced by nanosecond laser pulse in two liquid perfluorocarbons (PFCs), perfluoropentane (PFP) and perfluorohexane (PFH), were realized and detected in optical and acoustic way to reveal the effective parameters for photodisruption. A confocal microscopic system was performed to record the bubble dynamics by high speed photography, and simultaneously the acoustic signal emitted during photodisruption. A 532 nm laser, with pulse duration of 3 ns and average power of 50 μJ, was focused to the cellulose tube where the laser, acoustic detection and microscopic imaging were aligned and PFCs were injected. Passive acoustic detection (PCD) was realized by a 1 mm needle hydrophone connected via a receiver amplifier to a high speed digitizer. The spectrum analysis and time-frequency analysis were used to show the acoustic characteristics of photodisruption in liquid PFCs. Then, the laser energy thresholds of photodisruption and the influences of ambient temperature on photodisruption were revealed. The bubble behavior mainly followed three patterns in PFP but two patterns in PFH. The difference among patterns was closely related with the ambient temperature. In acoustic detection, significant signals were recorded by PCD once photodisruption occurred in either PFP or PFH. The PCD signals of PFP and PFH showed difference in time-domain. However, their frequency spectrums were mainly distributed between 0-2 MHz and seemed without significant difference. The time-frequency analysis verified their difference in time-domain. The physical process of photodisruption was closely associated with both laser parameters and liquid properties. It was indicated that the thresholds for PFP and PFH were 43.33 μJ and 45 μJ, respectively. But the increasing ambient temperature was helpful to photodisruption in both PFP and PFH.",Integrated optics;Optical imaging;Optical pumping;Ultrafast optics;Stimulated emission;Biomedical optical imaging;photodisruption;nanosecond laser;cavitation bubble;passive acoustic detection;perfluorocarbons,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0399
3-d Tessellation of Plant Tissue - A Dual Optimization Approach to Cell-Level Meristem Reconstruction from Microscopy Images,"The goal of this paper is the reconstruction of topologically accurate 3-dimensional triangular meshes representing a complex, multi-layered plant tissue structure. Based on time sequences of meristem images of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, displaying fluorescence markers on either cell membranes or cell nuclei under confocal laser scanning microscopy, we aim at obtaining faithful reconstructions of all the cell walls in the tissue. In the presented method, the problem is tackled under the angle of topology, and the shape of the cells is seen as the dual geometry of a 3-d simplicial complex accounting for their adjacency relationships. We present a method for optimizing such complexes using an energy minimization process, designed to make them fit to the actual adjacencies in the tissue.

Cancer diagnosis using automatic mitotic cell detection and segmentation in histopathological images,"Cancer is a disease characterized by abnormal cell growth in the human body. Cancer is evaluated by histopathological examination, which is important for further treatment planning.

Nuclear segmentation for skin cancer diagnosis from histopathological images,"Skin cancer is the most frequent and malignant type of cancer. Melanoma is the most aggressive type among skin cancers and if they are detected at an early stage, they can be completely cured. In melanoma diagnosis, the detection of the melanocytes in the epidermis area is an important step. For the detection of melanocytes, use of histopathological images can be used. With the recent advent of whole slide digital scanners, tissue histopathology slides can now be digitized and stored in digital image form. The digitized images are analysed with advanced image segmentation algorithms and features such as intensity and size of the cell nuclei is used to filter out the candidate nuclei regions.

Dynamic bi-modal fusion of images for the segmentation of pollen tubes in video,"Biologists study pollen tube growth to understand how internal cell dynamics affect observable structural characteristics like cell diameter, length, and growth rate. Fluorescence microscopy is used to study the dynamics of internal proteins and ions, but this often produces images with missing parts of the pollen tube. Brightfield microscopy provides a low-cost way of obtaining structural information about the pollen tube, but the images are crowded with false edges. We propose a dynamic segmentation fusion scheme that uses both Bright-field and Fluorescence images of growing pollen tubes to get a unified segmentation. Knowledge of the image formation process is used to create an initial estimate of the location of the cell boundary. Fusing this estimate with an edge indicator function amplifies desired edges and attenuates undesired edges. The cell boundary is obtained using Level Set evolution on the fused edge indicator function. Experimental testing shows that this fusion produces significantly better results than those obtained without it.",Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Electron tubes;Fluorescence;Mathematical model;Level set;Shape;pollen tube segmentation;image fusion;Fluorescence and Brightfield video analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350777
A bag-of-features approach for malignancy detection in breast histopathology images,"The paper addresses the problem of detecting malignancy in breast histopathology images. The proposed method uses bag-of-features method to represent visual content of the image dataset. The features are extracted from training dataset by using SIFT technique. Further classification is carried out using Euclidean distance measure. The method was evaluated using the dataset of breast histopathology images having annotated as normal, invasive and in-situ. The keypoints are extracted from R, G and B components and collectively form discriminative visual features. In the classification task, the paper proposes two-stage classification. In stage-I sample is classified as normal or cancerous. In stage-II, if the sample is annotated as cancerous, it gets further classified according to its type that is, either invasive or in-situ. The method showed stage-I performance as 74.28% for normal and 90.39% for cancerous images. In Stage-II, accuracy for invasive and in-situ types is 98.86% and 84.09% respectively.",Feature extraction;Cancer;Ducts;Visualization;Biomedical imaging;Breast;Training;bag-of-features;breast histopathology;cancer detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351745
A novel feature descriptor based on microscopy image statistics,"In this paper, we propose a novel feature description algorithm based on image statistics. The pipeline first performs independent component analysis on training image patches to obtain basis vectors (filters) for a lower dimensional representation. Then for a given image, a set of filter responses at each pixel is computed. Finally, a histogram representation, which considers the signs and magnitudes of the responses as well as the number of filters, is applied on local image patches. We propose to apply this idea to a microscopy image pixel identification system based on a learning framework. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the state-of-the-art descriptors in biomedical images of different microscopy modalities.",Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Training;Histograms;Electron microscopy;Labeling;local image descriptor;pixel labeling;cell detection;phase contrast imaging;electron microscopy;mitochondria;tumor;cell co-culture,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351292
Multi-scoring feature selection method based on SVM-RFE for prostate cancer diagnosis,"Prostate cancer diagnosis is based mainly by microscopic evaluation of prostate tissue biopsy which includes assigning cancer grading. The latter is crucial in evaluating the prognosis or cancer progression and treatment. The common grading system used is Gleason grading system that classifies the prostate cancer into five basic grades based on the architecture and pattern of glandular proliferation. However, this process may be subjected to inter and intra observer variation. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to develop a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) utilizing supervised machine learning techniques for Gleason grading of prostate histology. The proposed procedure utilizes the main tissue components of the images in an ensemble style to correctly classify the input histopathological image into benign or malignant. Moreover, the texture features of the benign and malignant images can be used to build the proposed ensemble framework. However, not all extracted texture features contribute to the improvement of the classification performance of the proposed ensemble framework. Therefore, to select the more informative features from a set is a critical issue. In this study, a new multi-scoring features selection method based on SVM-RFE and conditional mutual information (CMI) is proposed.",Feature extraction;Prostate cancer;Redundancy;Image color analysis;Support vector machines;Mutual information;Prostate cancer;Tissue components;Ensemble classification;Feature selection;SVM;SVM-RFE;CMI,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI),10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352585

In this paper, we develop a new approach for segmenting and detecting intestinal glands in H&E stained histology images, which utilizes a set of advanced image processing techniques such as graph search, ensemble, feature extraction and classification. Our method computes fast, and is able to preserve gland boundaries robustly and detect glands accurately. We tested the performance of gland detection and segmentation by analyzing a dataset of 1723 glands from digitized high-resolution clinical histology images obtained in normal and diseased intestines.

An interactive learning framework for scalable classification of pathology images,"Recent advances in microscopy imaging and genomics have created an explosion of patient data in the pathology domain. Whole-slide images (WSIs) of tissues can now capture disease processes as they unfold in high resolution, recording the visual cues that have been the basis of pathologic diagnosis for over a century. Each WSI contains billions of pixels and up to a million or more microanatomic objects whose appearances hold important prognostic information. Computational image analysis enables the mining of massive WSI datasets to extract quantitative morphologic features describing the visual qualities of patient tissues. When combined with genomic and clinical variables, this quantitative information provides scientists and clinicians with insights into disease biology and patient outcomes. To facilitate interaction with this rich resource, we have developed a web-based machine-learning framework that enables users to rapidly build classifiers using an intuitive active learning process that minimizes data labeling effort. In this paper we describe the architecture and design of this system, and demonstrate its effectiveness through quantification of glioma brain tumors.",Pathology;Microscopy;Data visualization;Image analysis;Training;Algorithm design and analysis;Cancer;machine learning;interactive systems;biomedical image processing;pathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10.1109/BigData.2015.7363841
An Automatic Corneal Subbasal Nerve Registration System Using FFT and Phase Correlation Techniques for an Accurate DPN Diagnosis,"Confocal microscopy is employed as a fast and non-invasive way to capture a sequence of images from different layers and membranes of the cornea. The captured images are used to extract useful and helpful clinical information for early diagnosis of corneal diseases such as, Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN). In this paper, an automatic corneal subbasal nerve registration system is proposed. The main aim of the proposed system is to produce a new informative corneal image that contains structural and functional information. In addition a colour coded corneal image map is produced by overlaying a sequence of Cornea Confocal Microscopy (CCM) images that differ in their displacement, illumination, scaling, and rotation to each other. An automatic image registration method is proposed based on combining the advantages of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and phase correlation techniques. The proposed registration algorithm searches for the best common features between a number of sequenced CCM images in the frequency domain to produce the formative image map. In this generated image map, each colour represents the severity level of a specific clinical feature that can be used to give ophthalmologists a clear and precise representation of the extracted clinical features from each nerve in the image map. Moreover, successful implementation of the proposed system and the availability of the required datasets opens the door for other interesting ideas, for instance, it can be used to give ophthalmologists a summarized and objective description about a diabetic patient's health status using a sequence of CCM images that have been captured from different imaging devices and/or at different times.",Correlation;Feature extraction;Image registration;Cornea;Diabetes;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Diabetic;Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy;Image Registration;Fast Fourier Transform;Phase Correlation;Automatic Nerve Segmentation;Corneal Confocal Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing",10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.157
A subset-search and ranking based feature-selection for histology image classification using global and local quantification,"Biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of chronic liver diseases. However, the variability in the diagnostic between readers leads to define a method to objectively describe histologic tissue. A complete framework has been implemented to analyze images of any tissue. Based on subset selection and feature ranking approaches, a feature selection computes the most relevant subset of descriptors in terms of classification from a wide initial list of descriptors. In comparison with equivalent methods, this implementation can find lists of descriptors which are significantly shorter for an equivalent accuracy. Furthermore, it enables the classification of slides using combinations of global and local measurements. The results have pointed that it could reach an accuracy of 90.5% (ROC-AUC=81.1%) in a human liver fibrosis grading approach by selecting 3 of the 457 global and local descriptors.

Automated identification of chicken eimeria species from microscopic images,"Eimeria is an internal animal parasite that causes serious diseases and animal death, and reduces animal productivities. Eimeria has more than one species for every single genus of animals. An early diagnosis of Eimeria infection is usually achieved by examining fecal microscopy images. As Eimeria oocysts vary in terms of shapes, sizes and textures, they can be detected by measuring differences in their shapes, sizes and textural features. As these differences can be driven by analyzing pixel information in microscopic images, this paper therefore presents pixel-based features rather than using the oocysts morphological characteristics. This approach is then applied for the diagnosis of seven different species of Eimeria in chickens as a case study. The pixel-based features are the mean of pixel values over columns and rows of oocyst image matrices in grey-scaled images. The features have been extracted after detecting the oocyst edges by using Moore-Neighbor Tracing Algorithm. For the classification phase, K-Nearest Neighbor classifier was utilized. For its statistical validation, a 5-fold cross validation was adapted and run for 100 times. This proposed approach has yielded an average accuracy of 82% ± 0.54% This is a promising result that is potentially expected to lead fully automated portable parasite detection system.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Radio frequency;Animals;Diseases;Image segmentation;Shape,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE),10.1109/BIBE.2015.7367686
Appearance-based necrosis detection using textural features and SVM with discriminative thresholding in histopathological whole slide images,"Automatic detection of necrosis in histological images is an interesting problem of digital pathology that needs to be addressed. Determination of presence and extent of necrosis can provide useful information for disease diagnosis and prognosis, and the detected necrotic regions can also be excluded before analyzing the remaining living tissue. This paper describes a novel appearance-based method to detect tumor necrosis in histopathogical whole slide images. Studies are performed on heterogeneous microscopic images of gastric cancer containing tissue regions with variation in malignancy level and stain intensity. Textural image features are extracted from image patches to efficiently represent necrotic appearance in the tissue and machine learning is performed using support vector machines followed by discriminative thresholding for our complex datasets. The classification results are quantitatively evaluated for different image patch sizes using two cross validation approaches namely three-fold and leave one out cross validation, and the best average cross validation rate of 85.31% is achieved for the most suitable patch size. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising tool to detect necrosis in heterogeneous whole slide images, showing its robustness to varying visual appearances.",Tumors;Cancer;Visualization;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Kernel;Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE),10.1109/BIBE.2015.7367702
Lens-free automated cell detection system for telemedicine application,"Cell and micro particle analysis is one of the major tasks in many clinical labs culturing cells. The functional profiles of cells such as concentration, size, morphology and viability are the key parameters for early diagnosis of many diseases. However in most labs, especially in the resource limited settings, these processes are done fully manually using conventional optical microscopes, which are slow and prone to subjective errors. Recently the lens-free shadow imaging system has been introduced as an alternative for the conventional optical microscopy. In this paper we demonstrate a dedicated algorithm for lens-free shadow imaging system, which was implemented as a smartphone application. This android application can wirelessly acquire the images from the lens-free system and process them automatically. The results can be obtained locally or sent to a remote expert for further analysis.

"A New Model for the Segmentation of Multiple, Overlapping, Near-Circular Objects","Some of the most difficult image segmentation problems involve an unknown number of object instances that can touch or overlap in the image, e.g. microscopy imaging of cells in biology. In an important set of cases, the nature of the objects and the imaging process mean that when objects overlap, the resulting image is approximately given by the sum of intensities of individual objects; and, in addition, the objects of interest are `blob-like' or near-circular. We propose a new model for the segmentation of the objects in such images. The posterior energy is the sum of a prior energy modelling shape and a likelihood energy modelling the image. The prior is a multi-layer nonlocal phase field energy that favours configurations consisting of a number of possibly overlapping or touching near-circular object instances. The likelihood energy models the additive nature of image intensity in regions corresponding to overlapping objects. We use variational methods to compute a MAP estimate of the object instances in an image. We test the resulting model on synthetic data and on fluorescence microscopy images of cell nuclei.",Shape;Computational modeling;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Level set;Additives,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA),10.1109/DICTA.2015.7371219
Anatomical Skin Segmentation in Reflectance Confocal Microscopy with Weak Labels,"Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) allows in-vivo microscopic examination of human skin and is emerging as a powerful tool for a wide range of dermatological problems. Clinical use of RCM is limited by the need for trained experts to interpret images and the lack of supporting tools for quantitative evaluation of the images, especially in large datasets. The first task in understanding RCM images is to understand and produce a segmentation of the anatomical strata of human skin. This work presents such an algorithm using only weak supervision, in the form of labels for whole en-face sections, to learn a per pixel segmentation of a complete RCM depth stack. Using a bag-of- features representation for image appearance, and a conditional random field model for strata labels through the depth of the skin, a structured support vector machine was trained to label individual pixels. The approach was developed and tested on a dataset of 308 depth stacks from 54 volunteers, consisting of 16,144 total en-face sections. This approach accurately classified 85.7% of sections in the test set, and was able to detect underlying changes in the skin strata thickness with age.",Skin;Feature extraction;Histograms;Dictionaries;Microscopy;Encoding;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA),10.1109/DICTA.2015.7371231

An automated system for segmenting platelets from microscopic images of blood cells,"Platelet count is a very important diagnosis test to identify diseases like Dengue, Malaria, Yellow fever, and others. For dengue patient monitoring, platelet count is often needed. A suspected dengue patient needs a very quick diagnosis to give an accurate result of how critical is the condition of the patient. In most laboratories, Leishman's stained blood slides are used to count platelets. However, these manual platelet counting requires expert lab technician and the overhead increases manifold when huge blood samples are to be checked by lab technicians that make the entire process time-consuming. So, in this paper, an automated system is proposed which can extract platelets from the microscopic image of blood cells, and that makes platelet counting task easy. Microscopic images of stained blood slides are captured using a light microscope. Then using color-based segmentation and morphological operation, platelets can be extracted. A comparative study between the platelet counts obtained before and after segmentation along with calculation of the efficiency of the system has shown this method to be robust and effective for automation of platelet count system.",Image segmentation;Pediatrics;Blood;Heart;Plasmas;Matched filters;Platelet segmentation;Morphological operation;Color based segmentation;dengue diagnosis,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 International Symposium on Advanced Computing and Communication (ISACC),10.1109/ISACC.2015.7377347

Analysis of thin blood images for automated malaria diagnosis,The paper describes novel pre-processing techniques for the analysis of thin-film microscopic images of blood infected with the malaria parasite.

The paper also introduces a new algorithm for morphological filtering of the blood images as a pre-processing tool for segmentation. Conventional morphological closing on blood images removes the unwanted components but also leads to loss of valuable information. The proposed morphological filtering preserves the necessary information of foreground components while removing noise and artefacts.

How to define and implement diagnosis assistants in tissue-based diagnosis (surgical pathology): A survey,"Digital pathology has started to enter the field of tissue - based diagnosis. It offers several applications, especially assistance in routine surgical pathology (tissue - based diagnosis). Diagnosis assistants are programs that assist the routine diagnosis work of a pathologist. Herein we describe how to appropriate design suitable algorithms. Theory: Tissue - based diagnoses derives from a) image content information, b) clinical history, c) expertise of the pathologist, d) knowledge about the disease. It can be transferred to a statistical decision algorithm (neural network, discriminate analysis, factor analysis, ... ). Image content information: Analysis of image content information (ICI) can contribute to medical diagnosis at different levels. The level depends upon the underlying disease (diagnosis) and the derived potential treatment. Pre - analysis algorithms include a) image standardization (shading, magnification, grey value distribution), and evaluation of regions of interest (ROI). ICI is embedded in three coordinates (texture, object, structure). Analysis of objects and structure require external knowledge (cell, nerve, vessel, tree, man, ... ). Texture is solely pixel - based and independent from external knowledge [1,2]. Algorithms: Stereology, syntactic structure analysis and measurement of object features (area, circumference, moments, ... ) are useful tools in combination with external knowledge and appropriate image standardization. Structure and texture parameters require the definition of neighbourhood (Voronoi, O'Caliaghan). Texture features are based upon algorithms that mimic time series analysis and can contribute to ROI definition and to disease classification [1, 2]. Material: Crude diagnoses have been automatically evaluated by the same algorithm from large sets of histological images comprising different organs (colon, lung, pleura, stomach, thyroid (> 1,000 cases). The trials resulted in a reproducible and correct classification (90 - 98 %). Conclusions: The applied algorithms can be combined to construct efficient diagnosis assistants. They can be extended to assistants of more differentiated diagnoses (inclusion of specific stains, clinical history, etc ... ). They can serve to formulate a general theory of ""image information"".",Neoplasms;Cancer;Lesions;Diseases;Prognostics and health management;History;Biomedical imaging;Tissue-based diagnosis;image content information;diagnosis algorithms;digital pathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS),10.1109/IntelCIS.2015.7397205
Automated classification of malaria parasite species on thick blood film using support vector machine,"Malaria is a serious global health problem. It requires fast and effective diagnosis for detecting and classifying the type of infection. Proper treatment should be administered in a timely fashion to prevent an outbreak. Microscopic examination of thick blood films is one of the current standards for malaria diagnosis. However, inspecting a thick blood film is time-consuming and requires experienced technicians. Hence, for developing countries where most cases of malaria occur but microscopy expertise may not be available, a computerized system to aid such diagnosis is desirable. In this paper, an automated classification system operating on digitized images of thick blood film has been developed to classify between Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite species. The system is fully automated. It is fast and can be handled by non-experts. We calculate five statistical features - mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness and entropy - from four color channels (green, intensity, saturation, and value) of these images. The features are then projected onto a subspace representing image characteristics from both species. The projected features are used by the support vector machine for classification.

Plasmodium vivax classification from digitalization microscopic thick blood film using combination of second order statistical feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier method,"Malaria disease is one of the most serious public health problem in various tropical countries, included in Indonesia. Data of The Ministry of Health mentioned that Papua, West Papua, and NTT (Nusa Tenggara Timur) are provinces which have the greatest cases of malaria. With high mortality rate, malaria need to be treated as quick as possible. Therefore, the accurate and timely diagnosis of malaria infection is essential to control and to cure the disease. We propose an accurate method to classify plasmodium vivax from digitalization microscopic thick blood film using combination of second order statistic feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier method. In this feature extraction, we use GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) to get contrasts, correlations, energys, and homogeneity values. Those values will be inserted in classification module as an input. We use K-NN classifier method to classify the red blood film are infected by plasmodium vivax or not. This process can also classify plasmodium vivax into thropozoit, schizont, and gametocytes.

Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Water Extent in Poyang Lake using HJ-1 data,"Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Water Extent in Poyang Lake is significant to reveal ecological environment evolution and drought formation mechanism and the influence in the Poyang lake basin. Water extent is the key index to characterize the scale and intensity of drought disaster. The seasonal water change of Poyang Lake is obvious. There is high landscape heterogeneity because the terrain features distribution is highly complex and discontinuous in the dry season. At the same time spectral characteristics of water and its surroundings are complicated in that the microscopic formation mechanism of water is complicated. It is difficult to perform water information extraction. The commonly used water information extraction methods such as classification method, image segmentation method, threshold method, region growing method can't meet the requirements on the efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, Water information extraction and validation of 2011 was performed using HJ-1 CCD data based on decision tree method. Then temporal and spatial analysis of water extent was performed. At last, the relationship between the water extent and disaster loss information was analyzed. The results indicated that the decision tree method significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy compared to the traditional classification method and visual interpretation. It spent 2 hour in extracting water of dry season which need 2 days using visual interpretation method. The accuracy of the method was 94.5 percent of the accuracy using visual interpretation.

To this end, we use these priors not only to select voxels most in need of annotation but to guarantee that they lie on 2D planar patch, which makes it much easier to annotate than if they were randomly distributed in the volume. A simplified version of this approach is effective in natural 2D images. We evaluated our approach on Electron Microscopy and Magnetic Resonance image volumes, as well as on natural images. Comparing our approach against several accepted baselines demonstrates a marked performance increase.",Uncertainty;Three-dimensional displays;Entropy;Image segmentation;Training;Labeling;Geometry,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV),10.1109/ICCV.2015.340
Unsupervised fuzzy cognitive map in diagnosis of breast epithelial lesions,"Breast cancer can be classified in terms of histology, considering their structural and cellular pattern. Histological misdiagnosis will cause wrong treatment and in some cases, it will lead to patient's death. In this paper, application of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) as a modeling and classifying tool to diagnose the type of breast lesions is studied. Based on ten major histopathological features, 86 subjects were classified by expert pathologists according to World Health Organization (WHO) global system into three groups including UDH, ADH and DCIS. In this study, considering the inherent nature of FCM, the physician's knowledge is used to construct and modify FCM model in diagnosing the type of the lesion and the resulted FCM is trained by Nonlinear Hebbian Learning (NHL) method. The classification is made based on histopathological features, which are the same concepts of FCM model. The classification accuracy for UDH is 88% and for ADH & DCIS is 86%.",Lesions;Breast;Cancer;Ducts;Medical diagnostic imaging;Biopsy;Organizations;Fuzzy cognitive map;Nonlinear hebbian learning;Ductal epithelial lesion,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 22nd Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME),10.1109/ICBME.2015.7404127
Automated mitosis detection based on combination of effective textural and morphological features from breast cancer histology slide images,"Number of mitotic cells in histopathology images of breast cancer is graded as one of three important factors for this cancer. In this paper, an automatic system is presented to assist pathologists in the diagnosis and mitotic cell counting in less time to overcome two major challenges in this context. The first challenge is the large variety in the structure of mitotic cells and the other is the large number of candidates for mitotic cells. In the proposed method, statistical Gamma-Gaussian Mixture Model (GGMM) has been employed in extraction of primary candidates, for estimating the Probability Density Function (PDF) of mitosis and non-mitosis cells. The effective features based on the texture and shape using Gabor filter, co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Complete LBP and morphometric and shape-based features, extracted from each candidate. Finally, by using of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with different kernel functions of RBF, Linear and Quadratic and decision tree classifier with 50 trees, mitotic cells has been detected. The evaluations are applied over histology datasets A and H offered by the Mitos-ICPR2012 contest sponsors.

Robust leukocyte segmentation in blood microscopic images based on intuitionistic fuzzy divergence,"Image processing-based analysis of microscopic leukocyte helps in early detection of many diseases. It is a challenging issue to segment leukocytes under uneven imaging conditions since features of microscopic leukocyte images change in different labratories. This paper introduces an automatic robust method to segment leukocyte from blood microscopic images using intuitionistic fuzzy divergence based thresholding. The method is constructed based on three simple assumptions which is common between blood microscopic images. To evaluate the robustness of proposed method, it has been tested on three dataset.

Automated Colon Cancer Detection Using Structural and Morphological Features,"Traditionally, colon cancer is diagnosed using microscopic analysis of histopathological colon samples. The manual examination of tissue specimens is not only time consuming, but is also subjective, and depends upon a few factors such as experience and work-load of the histopathologist. Therefore, research community is constantly putting efforts in developing automated colon cancer diagnostic systems, which can provide reliable second opinion to the histopathologists. Colon biopsy image based classification is one of such computer-aided diagnostic technique that can help in quantifying the differences in the structure of normal and malignant colon tissues without needing the subjective involvement of histopathologists. In this work, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic technique that models the differences in the regular organization of normal colon tissues and irregular structure of malignant colon tissues in terms of a few features such as least square distances, elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) and morphological features. These features are extracted from each colon biopsy image, and are given as input to classifier. An ensemble of SVM kernels, based on majority voting, has been developed for classification of samples into normal and malignant classes. Features are also combined to develop an information rich hybrid feature vector, which is also used for the classification. The proposed method has been tested on a colon biopsy image based dataset, and performance has been observed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC), and Kappa statistics. It has been observed that each feature type performs reasonably well. Further, ensemble classifier and the hybrid feature vector have shown better performance compared to individual features and the individual classifiers, respectively.",Colon;Cancer;Feature extraction;Biopsy;Kernel;Support vector machines;Shape;Elliptic Fourier descriptors;morphological features;Least sqaure ellipses;SVM classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,2015 13th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology (FIT),10.1109/FIT.2015.49

Robust technique for the detection of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"The counting and classification of blood cells helps in diagnosing a vast number of blood diseases. One type of hematological neoplasia which is most common among those blood diseases is Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and it mostly occurs in the age group of 3-7. The characterization of ALL is done by rapid and uncontrolled growth of immature leukemic cells (also named as blast cells) mainly in bone marrow and lymphoid organs. The primary step in the diagnosis of ALL is the morphological analysis of the bone marrow and blood smear under the microscope. Valuable information is provided by the features extracted from the blood cells for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Nowadays, this is performed manually by experienced operators. The process have numerous drawbacks, such as non-standard accuracy, dependency on the operator skills and time consuming too. A computerized system will be helpful for the analysis of stained microscopic images of the blood cells for quantitative examination. This paper demonstrates a method using morphological operations in MATLAB to segment images and compare between different classifiers to perfectly diagnose the presence of ALL in blood smear.",Blood;Feature extraction;Cells (biology);Image segmentation;Support vector machines;Artificial neural networks;Graphical user interfaces;Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL);Image segmentation;Cell features extraction;Lymphocyte classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,"2015 IEEE Power, Communication and Information Technology Conference (PCITC)",10.1109/PCITC.2015.7438079
Feature extraction and disease stage classification for Glioma histopathology images,"This paper discusses the performance of feature descriptors for disease stage evaluation of Glioma images. In the field of histopathology, many evaluation methods for tissue images have been reported. However, pathologists have to analyze and evaluate many tissue images manually. In addition, the criteria of evaluation heavily depend on each pathologist's experience and feelings. From this background, studies on computational pathology using computer vision have been reported. The proposed feature descriptors were, however, applied to specified diseases only, and we do not know whether these descriptors will be effective to other tissues or not. This paper applied the feature descriptors defined by previous studies to the Glioma images and investigated the effectiveness of them by using a statistical method. We also discussed a method to distinguish low-grade from high-grade Glioma images by using the significant descriptors. After the experiments, more than 98% of Glioma images were classified correctly.",Diseases;Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Pathology;Support vector machines;Image edge detection;Pediatrics,INPROCEEDINGS,2015,"2015 17th International Conference on E-health Networking, Application & Services (HealthCom)",10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454574

Imaging cell division in E-coli using white light diffraction phase microscopy,"Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) techniques is an emerging field aimed at studying weakly scattering and absorbing specimens. QPI techniques provide 3-d images with high contrast, compared to qualitative imaging techniques like bright field imaging, phase contrast imaging, differential interference contrast imaging. White light diffraction phase microscopy (wDPM) is one of the QPI techniques which provide both amplitude and phase images simultaneously with single shot. It also uses common path interferometric geometry which provide better temporal sensitivity compared to other interferometric techniques. Also wDPM uses the white light as the illumination source which makes this imaging technique unique in speckle free imaging. The rate of recording the cellular dynamics is only limited by the camera speed. In this work we developed the wDPM techniques and characterized the system in terms of resolution and sensitivity.

A Predictive Model for Personalized Therapeutic Interventions in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes the most common type of lung cancer and is frequently diagnosed at advanced stages. Clinical studies have shown that molecular targeted therapies increase survival and improve quality of life in patients. Nevertheless, the realization of personalized therapies for NSCLC faces a number of challenges including the integration of clinical and genetic data and a lack of clinical decision support tools to assist physicians with patient selection. To address this problem, we used frequent pattern mining to establish the relationships of patient characteristics and tumor response in advanced NSCLC. Univariate analysis determined that smoking status, histology, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, and targeted drug were significantly associated with response to targeted therapy. We applied four classifiers to predict treatment outcome from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Overall, the highest classification accuracy was 76.56% and the area under the curve was 0.76. The decision tree used a combination of EGFR mutations, histology, and smoking status to predict tumor response and the output was both easily understandable and in keeping with current knowledge. Our findings suggest that support vector machines and decision trees are a promising approach for clinical decision support in the patient selection for targeted therapy in advanced NSCLC.",Predictive models;Tumors;Decision trees;Medical treatment;Association rules;Cancer;Lungs;decision support;epidermal growth factor receptor;non-small cell lung cancer;personalized medicine;Decision support;epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR);non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC);personalized medicine,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2014.2377517
Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) for Nuclei Detection on Breast Cancer Histopathology Images,"Automated nuclear detection is a critical step for a number of computer assisted pathology related image analysis algorithms such as for automated grading of breast cancer tissue specimens. The Nottingham Histologic Score system is highly correlated with the shape and appearance of breast cancer nuclei in histopathological images. However, automated nucleus detection is complicated by 1) the large number of nuclei and the size of high resolution digitized pathology images, and 2) the variability in size, shape, appearance, and texture of the individual nuclei. Recently there has been interest in the application of “Deep Learning” strategies for classification and analysis of big image data. Histopathology, given its size and complexity, represents an excellent use case for application of deep learning strategies. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a deep learning strategy, is presented for efficient nuclei detection on high-resolution histopathological images of breast cancer. The SSAE learns high-level features from just pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of nuclei. A sliding window operation is applied to each image in order to represent image patches via high-level features obtained via the auto-encoder, which are then subsequently fed to a classifier which categorizes each image patch as nuclear or non-nuclear. Across a cohort of 500 histopathological images (2200 × 2200) and approximately 3500 manually segmented individual nuclei serving as the groundtruth, SSAE was shown to have an improved F-measure 84.49% and an average area under Precision-Recall curve (AveP) 78.83%. The SSAE approach also out-performed nine other state of the art nuclear detection strategies.",Feature extraction;Training;Breast cancer;Pathology;Image color analysis;Decoding;Automated nuclei detection;breast cancer histopathology;feature representation learning;stacked sparse autoencoder;digital pathology;deep learning,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2015.2458702
Fusing Heterogeneous Features From Stacked Sparse Autoencoder for Histopathological Image Analysis,"In the analysis of histopathological images, both holistic (e.g., architecture features) and local appearance features demonstrate excellent performance, while their accuracy may vary dramatically when providing different inputs. This motivates us to investigate how to fuse results from these features to enhance the accuracy. Particularly, we employ content-based image retrieval approaches to discover morphologically relevant images for image-guided diagnosis, using holistic and local features, both of which are generated from the cell detection results by a stacked sparse autoencoder. Because of the dramatically different characteristics and representations of these heterogeneous features (i.e., holistic and local), their results may not agree with each other, causing difficulties for traditional fusion methods. In this paper, we employ a graph-based query-specific fusion approach where multiple retrieval results (i.e., rank lists) are integrated and reordered based on a fused graph. The proposed method is capable of combining the strengths of local or holistic features adaptively for different inputs. We evaluate our method on a challenging clinical problem, i.e., histopathological image-guided diagnosis of intraductal breast lesions, and it achieves 91.67% classification accuracy on 120 breast tissue images from 40 patients.",Feature extraction;Image analysis;Accuracy;Computer architecture;Image retrieval;Biomedical imaging;Fuses;Breast lesion;feature fusion;histopathological image analysis;large-scale image retrieval;stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE),ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2461671
Single-Cell Optical Absorbance Characterization With High-Throughput Microfluidic Microscopy,"Morphological changes in cells associated with disease states are often assessed using clinical microscopy. However, the changes in chemical composition of cells can also be used to detect disease conditions. Optical absorption measurements carried out on single cells using inexpensive sources, detectors can help assess the chemical composition of cells; thereby enable detection of diseases. In this article, we present a novel technique capable of simultaneously detecting changes in morphology and chemical composition of cells. The presented technique enables characterization of optical absorbance-based methods against microscopy for detection of disease states. Using the technique, we have been able to achieve a throughput of about 1000 cells per second. We demonstrate the proof-of-principle by detecting malaria in a given blood sample.

An Automatic Learning-Based Framework for Robust Nucleus Segmentation,"Computer-aided image analysis of histopathology specimens could potentially provide support for early detection and improved characterization of diseases such as brain tumor, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET), and breast cancer. Automated nucleus segmentation is a prerequisite for various quantitative analyses including automatic morphological feature computation. However, it remains to be a challenging problem due to the complex nature of histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for robust and automatic nucleus segmentation with shape preservation. Given a nucleus image, it begins with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate a probability map, on which an iterative region merging approach is performed for shape initializations. Next, a novel segmentation algorithm is exploited to separate individual nuclei combining a robust selection-based sparse shape model and a local repulsive deformable model. One of the significant benefits of the proposed framework is that it is applicable to different staining histopathology images. Due to the feature learning characteristic of the deep CNN and the high level shape prior modeling, the proposed method is general enough to perform well across multiple scenarios. We have tested the proposed algorithm on three large-scale pathology image datasets using a range of different tissue and stain preparations, and the comparative experiments with recent state of the arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.",Shape;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Robustness;Computational modeling;Tumors;Breast cancer;Deep convolutional neural network;nucleus segmentation;sparse representation,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2015.2481436
Histopathological Image Classification Using Discriminative Feature-Oriented Dictionary Learning,"In histopathological image analysis, feature extraction for classification is a challenging task due to the diversity of histology features suitable for each problem as well as presence of rich geometrical structures. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature discovery framework via learning class-specific dictionaries and present a low-complexity method for classification and disease grading in histopathology. Essentially, our Discriminative Feature-oriented Dictionary Learning (DFDL) method learns class-specific dictionaries such that under a sparsity constraint, the learned dictionaries allow representing a new image sample parsimoniously via the dictionary corresponding to the class identity of the sample. At the same time, the dictionary is designed to be poorly capable of representing samples from other classes. Experiments on three challenging real-world image databases: 1) histopathological images of intraductal breast lesions, 2) mammalian kidney, lung and spleen images provided by the Animal Diagnostics Lab (ADL) at Pennsylvania State University, and 3) brain tumor images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, reveal the merits of our proposal over state-of-the-art alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate that DFDL exhibits a more graceful decay in classification accuracy against the number of training images which is highly desirable in practice where generous training is often not available.",Training;Optimization;Histopathological image analysis;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Histopathological image classification;sparse coding;dictionary learning;feature extraction;cancer grading,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2015.2493530
Nuclei-Based Features for Uterine Cervical Cancer Histology Image Analysis With Fusion-Based Classification,"Cervical cancer, which has been affecting women worldwide as the second most common cancer, can be cured if detected early and treated well. Routinely, expert pathologists visually examine histology slides for cervix tissue abnormality assessment. In previous research, we investigated an automated, localized, fusion-based approach for classifying squamous epithelium into Normal, CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3 grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) based on image analysis of 61 digitized histology images. This paper introduces novel acellular and atypical cell concentration features computed from vertical segment partitions of the epithelium region within digitized histology images to quantize the relative increase in nuclei numbers as the CIN grade increases. Based on the CIN grade assessments from two expert pathologists, image-based epithelium classification is investigated with voting fusion of vertical segments using support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis approaches. Leave-one-out is used for the training and testing for CIN classification, achieving an exact grade labeling accuracy as high as 88.5%.",Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Cervical cancer;Image analysis;Electronic mail;Clustering algorithms;Cancer;Cervical cancer;cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN);fusion-based classification;image processing;linear discriminant analysis (LDA);support vector machine (SVM),ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2483318
Unsupervised Profiling of Microglial Arbor Morphologies and Distribution Using a Nonparametric Bayesian Approach,"The morphologies of microglial arbors in brain tissue are important indicators of their state of activation, and their spatial distribution indicates patterns of tissue perturbation. This paper presents a non-parametric Bayesian approach to unsupervised quantitative profiling of microglial activation states, and mapping their 3-D spatial distributions across extended brain tissue regions imaged by mosaiced confocal microscopy. Our approach is to perform large-scale automated reconstruction of all the microglia using a learned label-consistent dictionary model for the microglial processes, and extract 136 arbor features per cell. We then fit an infinite Gaussian mixture model with collapsed Gibbs sampling to the arbor features, to discover arbor-morphological classes, their morphological `signatures', and the associated covariance matrices all in an unsupervised manner. This nonparametric approach can handle clusters with arbitrarily shaped covariance matrices, perform automatic model selection, handle unbalanced clusters, and detect overlapping classes, without the need to specify the number of clusters. The results can be used for diverse investigational purposes, including: population-scale modeling, automated discovery of arbor classes and their distinguishing quantitative signatures and features, quantifying the nature and extent of the cellular heterogeneity, and spatial mapping of cellular arbor morphologies, and mapping tissue alterations.",Morphology;Image reconstruction;Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Brain;Covariance matrices;Collapsed Gibbs sampling;Infinite Gaussian Mixture Models (IGMM);L-measure;microglia;morphological heterogeneity;non-parametric Bayesian;quantitative arbor morphology,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing,10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2505660
Relative Pose Estimation for Alignment of Long Cylindrical Components Based on Microscopic Vision,"In this paper, an efficient relative pose estimation method based on multimicroscopic vision is presented for the alignment of long cylindrical components in six degree-of-freedom in the 3-D space. First, the relative pose estimation method measures the relative orientation errors between components in a coarse-to-fine manner. The coarse relative orientation estimation reflects the average orientation difference among multiedges and it promises the relative orientation errors can converge to a limited extent rapidly. The fine relative orientation estimation is to detect whether the components will interfere with each other in the insertion process and it provides higher orientation measurement accuracy under multilateral constraint circumstance. The method to determine the invisible feature lines of long cylindrical components of prism shape with odd edges for relative position error estimation is discussed in detail. Afterward, the relative position between components is measured by side-view cameras using the feature lines. In addition, the method to calibrate the optical axis of microscopic camera is also presented. The relative pose estimation method can reliably estimate the relative pose between long cylindrical components of prism shape with odd edges.

Modulated-Alignment Dual-Axis (MAD) Confocal Microscopy Optimized for Speed and Contrast,"Modulated-alignment dual-axis (MAD) confocal microscopy combines the benefits of dual-axis confocal (DAC) microscopy and focal-modulation microscopy (FMM) for rejecting out-of-focus and multiply scattered light in tissues. The DAC architecture, which utilizes off-axis and separated beam paths for illumination and detection, has previously been shown to be superior to single-axis confocal (SAC) microscopy for the spatial filtering (rejection) of unwanted background light. With the MAD approach, a modulation of the alignment between the illumination and collection beam paths tags ballistic photons emanating from the focal volume with a characteristic radio frequency that can be extracted and separated from background signal using lock-in detection. We report here an optimized form of MAD confocal microscopy where we have fully mitigated tradeoffs in performance in an initial proof-of-concept system in order to recover the imaging speed of DAC microscopy while retaining contrast enhancement of 6 dB (signal-to-background ratio) with a secondary improvement in optical-sectioning and in-plane resolution.

Nanoscale Quantifying the Effects of Targeted Drug on Chemotherapy in Lymphoma Treatment Using Atomic Force Microscopy,"The applications of targeted drugs in treating cancers have significantly improved the survival rates of patients. However, in the clinical practice, targeted drugs are commonly combined with chemotherapy drugs, causing that the exact contribution of targeted drugs to the clinical outcome is difficult to evaluate. Quantitatively investigating the effects of targeted drugs on chemotherapy drugs on cancer cells is useful for us to understand drug actions and design better drugs. The advent of atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a powerful tool for probing the nanoscale physiological activities of single live cells. In this paper, the detailed changes in cell morphology and mechanical properties were quantified on single lymphoma cells during the actions of rituximab (a monoclonal antibody targeted drug) and two chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin and cytarabine) by AFM. AFM imaging revealed the distinct changes of cellular ultramicrostructures induced by the drugs.

Neurite Tracing With Object Process,"In this paper we present a pipeline for automatic analysis of neuronal morphology: from detection, modeling to digital reconstruction. First, we present an automatic, unsupervised object detection framework using stochastic marked point process. It extracts connected neuronal networks by fitting special configuration of marked objects to the centreline of the neurite branches in the image volume giving us position, local width and orientation information. Semantic modeling of neuronal morphology in terms of critical nodes like bifurcations and terminals, generates various geometric and morphology descriptors such as branching index, branching angles, total neurite length, internodal lengths for statistical inference on characteristic neuronal features. From the detected branches we reconstruct neuronal tree morphology using robust and efficient numerical fast marching methods. We capture a mathematical model abstracting out the relevant position, shape and connectivity information about neuronal branches from the microscopy data into connected minimum spanning trees. Such digital reconstruction is represented in standard SWC format, prevalent for archiving, sharing, and further analysis in the neuroimaging community. Our proposed pipeline outperforms state of the art methods in tracing accuracy and minimizes the subjective variability in reconstruction, inherent to semi-automatic methods.",Image reconstruction;Morphology;Pipelines;Neurons;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Digital reconstruction;fast marching;marked point processes;neuron morphology analysis;neurite tracing,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2016.2515068
Research Based on Fuzzy Algorithm of Cancer Cells in Pleural Fluid Microscopic Images Recognition,"This paper introduces a kind of cancer cells in pleural fluid microscopic images processing and fuzzy recognizing method. We propose a method, which firstly segments the image using the OTSU thresholding method and fuzzy edge detection, then extracts 7 measurement parameters i.e. the area rate of the karyon and cytoplasm, the optic density, the shape factor and else, finally uses fuzzy pattern recognition which is based on establishing 6 membership functions and 4 normative modes to recognize the cancer cells.

A Statistical Study of Sn Whisker Population and Growth During Elevated Temperature and Humidity Tests,"Storage tests at elevated temperature and humidity conditions have been widely adopted as one of the major acceleration tests for Sn whisker growth. However, the driving force associated and the nucleation and growth process of whiskers are yet to be fully understood. In this paper, Sn whisker growth on Cu leadframe material at two different test conditions is compared. Both loose and board-mounted components were used. At each read point, the length and location of every whisker observed was recorded. Statistical characteristics and growth rate of the whisker population will be presented for each of the tests conditions. On loose components, corrosion of the Sn finish was observed near the tip and the dam bar cut area of the leads with backscatter scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy. The entire population of whiskers was located in these corroded areas, and there were zero whiskers located in the noncorroded areas on the same leads. On board-mounted components, the corrosion level of the Sn finish, as well as the whisker population and length was greatly reduced compared to those on the loose components. These results suggest that the corrosion of Sn finish in high-temperature and high-humidity conditions is the major driving force for whisker growth. The cause for the difference between the loose and board-mounted components is also analyzed",Tin;Temperature distribution;Humidity;Optical microscopy;Corrosion;Scanning electron microscopy;Life estimation;Materials testing;Backscatter;Electron optics;Corrosion;electroplating;lead-free;whisker growth;tin finish,ARTICLE,2006,IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing,10.1109/TEPM.2006.887385

Development of Low Temperature Approaches to Device Quality Cadmium Sulfide: a Novel Geometry for Solution Growth of Thin Films and Their Characterization,"Cadmium sulfide thin films have been grown using a modified chemical bath deposition method with four innovative features: i) ethylenediamine was used as the complexing agent, enabling the use of low cadmium concentrations, ii) a rectangular bath geometry with heated glass plate walls was employed, iii) a low deposition temperature (30degC) was used and iv) nitrogen gas was flowed over the substrate surface during growth. The latter two features eliminate the formation and adherence of gas bubbles on the substrate during growth, hence reducing pinhole formation. On inspection, films were found to be specularly reflective and homogeneous with no visible pinholes. Characterization was performed by atomic force microscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, optical transmittance and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It was shown that films possessed a low surface roughness value of 5.2 nm, were highly crystalline, textured, had a grain size of 15 nm and a bandgap of 2.42 eV.

Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in Fundus Images using Vector Quantization Technique,"Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major cause of blindness among the people. Many approaches are proposed by the authors to automate and detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy in fundus image. We propose a novel method of detection of the diabetic retinopathy using Gaussian intensity feature input to a VQ classifier. The underlying idea of using this technique in fundus imaging is that there are certain features which pertain only to diabetic retinopathy. These features are extracted in terms of diameter of the blood vessels expressed by sigma, and the height of the Gaussian profile across the cross-section, given by h. In this work, 30 images are taken as normal images and 25 pathological images are considered.

Biophysical Active Contours for Cell Tracking I: Tension and Bending,"Automatic segmentation and tracking of biological objects from dynamic microscopy data is of great interest for quantitative biology. A successful framework for this task are active contours, curves that iteratively minimize a cost function, which contains both data-attachment terms and regularization constraints reflecting prior knowledge on the contour geometry. However the choice of these latter terms and of their weights is largely arbitrary, thus requiring time-consuming empirical parameter tuning and leading to sub-optimal results. Here, we report on a first attempt to use regularization terms based on known biophysical properties of cellular membranes. The present study is restricted to 2D images and cells with a simple to skeletal cortex underlying the membrane. We describe our new active contour model and its implementation, and show a first application to real biological images. The obtained segmentation is slightly better than standard active contours, however the main advantage lies in the self-consistent and automated determination of the weights of regularization terms. This encouraging result will lead us to extend the approach to 3D and more complex cells.",Active contours;Image segmentation;Biological system modeling;Cells (biology);Biomembranes;Image analysis;Microscopy;Cost function;Shape;Deformable models;Biophysics;Image segmentation;Biomedical image processing,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,2006 International Conference on Image Processing,10.1109/ICIP.2006.312796
Light-Emitting Silicon Nanocrystals and Photonic Structures in Silicon Nitride,"In this paper, we review our main results on the optical and electrical properties of light-emitting silicon nanocrystals (Si-ncs) obtained from the thermally induced nucleation in amorphous silicon-rich nitride (SRN) films deposited either by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) or magnetron sputtering. In particular, we discuss the Si-ncs microscopic light emission mechanism combining the optical data with the first-principle calculations of the absorption/emission Stokes shifts and recombination lifetimes. In addition, we report on the electrical injection characteristics of simple p-i-n device structures showing efficient bipolar transport and room temperature electroluminescence, and demonstrate efficient energy sensitization of erbium (Er) ions from the Si-ncs embedded in the SRN matrices. We further show that the light-emitting nanocrystals in SRN can be embedded in aperiodic photonic environments, where the localized optical modes can be used to significantly enhance the Si-ncs emission intensity at different emission wavelengths. These results suggest that the Si-ncs embedded in the SRN matrices have a large potential for the fabrication of optically active photonic devices based on the Si technology",Silicon;Nanocrystals;Optical films;Stimulated emission;Optical sensors;Plasma properties;Optical microscopy;Particle beam optics;Erbium;Optical devices;Electroluminescence;light sources;nanotechnology;silicon,ARTICLE,2006,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/JSTQE.2006.883138
High Purity p-type InP Grown by LPE with Rare-Earth Admixtures,"Specific features of rare-earth-oxides (PrOx, TbOx , Tm2O3, Gd2O3 and Eu 2O3) and Gd are employed to improve physical properties of InP layers. The InP layers were grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) on (100)-oriented single crystal InP substrates with rare-earth element (RE) addition to the growth melt. The surface morphology and defect density was monitored by optical and scanning electron microscopy, the evaluation of electrical properties was gained from C-V characteristics and Hall measurements, and the low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy was used to study the optical properties. Significant improvement of all studied layer parameters with increasing amount of RE in the melt was observed right to critical value of RE concentration.

Fabrication and Characterization of Probes for Combined SPM Techniques Based on PECVD,"The paper describes an approach for preparing probes for combined SPM techniques, such as scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)/photoelectrochemical microscopy (PEM), SECM/near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). The SECM/PEM probes were constructed firstly by stripping off a single mode optical fiber's polymer coating (125 mum diameter of cladding) at one end. The stripped optical fibers were then concentrically coated with Au thin film by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The Au thin film coated optical fibers were insulating using silicon nitride thin films of low temperature plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Polishing was used to simultaneously open up the surfaces of Au ring ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) of SECM and the apertures of PEM. Once fabricated, the probes were characterized with excellent adhesion qualities at the interfaces of Au thin film/optical fiber and silicon nitride thin film/Au thin film by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement. The silicon nitride thin films were found to be free of microcracks by SEM. Electrochemical properties of the probes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) through three-electrode system. The electrochemical responses of the probes are sigmoidal in shape at different scan rates and indicate that the fabricated Au ring electrodes exhibit UMEs' electrochemical response",Fabrication;Scanning probe microscopy;Optical microscopy;Optical films;Scanning electron microscopy;Gold;Semiconductor thin films;Optical fibers;Polymer films;Sputtering;scanning electrochemical microscopy;photoelectrochemical microscopy;PECVD;Silicon nitride thin films,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,2006 1st IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems,10.1109/NEMS.2006.334652

Microbial synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles using the Fe(III)-reducing bacterium shewanella algae,"Summary form only given. Noble metals nanoparticles can be applied to a wide range of functions such as catalysis, optics and biosensing. Although chemical and physical synthetic routes to noble metal nanoparticles have been extensively developed, another possibility is synthesis by bioreduction of noble metal ions using microorganism. For microbial synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles, we focused on the Fe(III)-reducing bacterium Shewanella algae, which is able to transfer electrons to Fe3+ ions. Intracellular synthesis of gold nanoparticles was achieved at 25degC and pH 7 using S. algae (ATCC 51181) with H2 as the electron donor. The reductive deposition of gold by S. algae was a fast process: 1 mol/m3 AuCl4 ions were completely reduced to insoluble gold within 30 min. Speciation of gold in bacterial cultures of S. algae by X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) showed that the trivalent gold ions were rapidly reduced to gold metal in the bacterial cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of thin sections of S. algae cells revealed that the biogenic gold nanoparticles of 10-20 nm were located in the periplasm. When the pH of the HAuCl4 solution was decreased from 7 to 1, many of the biogenic gold particles were synthesized extracellularly. The gold particles synthesized at pH 1 were typically 50 nm and 500 nm, and some were angular in shape and single crystal. This suggests that at pH 1, a gold-reducing enzyme is released from the periplasmic space into the aqueous solution, and the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of gold ions in the aqueous solution. We can therefore conclude that the solution pH is an important factor in controlling the morphology of biogenic gold particles and location of particle formation",Nanoparticles;Algae;Gold;Microorganisms;Biochemistry;Biomedical optical imaging;Electron optics;Particle beam optics;Biosensors;Chemicals,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,2006 Bio Micro and Nanosystems Conference,10.1109/BMN.2006.330876
A New Wavelet Based Multi-focus Image Fusion Scheme and Its Application on Optical Microscopy,"Multi-focus image fusion is a process of combining two or more partially defocused images into a new image with all interested objects sharply imaged. In this paper, after reviewing the multi-focus image fusion techniques, a wavelet based fusion scheme with new image activity level measurement is presented. The proposed multi-resolution image fusion technique includes three steps: first, multi-resolution discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to obtain the wavelet coefficients of the source images. Then, applying proposed coefficients fusion scheme to the obtained coefficients, the wavelet coefficients of the fusion image are reconstructed. Finally, the final fusion image is generated by applying inversed wavelet transform. In experiments, artificial defocused images (by applying low-pass filter to the specified regions) are utilized to investigate the performance of proposed scheme and to select suitable wavelet family and wavelet decomposition scales. Then we apply the proposed image fusion scheme to optical microscopy domain to solve the short depth of focus characteristic of optical microscope.

A New Approach for Segmentation and Quantification of Cells or Nanoparticles,"With the rapid development of microscopy imaging technology, the requirement for robust segmentation and quantification of cells or nanoparticles increases greatly. It remains challenging due to the diversity of the cell or nanoparticle types, the arbitrary shapes, and the large numbers of cells or nanoparticles. The most existing methods are only capable of segmenting some specific types of cells or nanoparticles. In this paper, we propose a more versatile approach that is capable of segmenting a variety of cells or nanoparticles. It consists of five parts: 1) automatic gradient image formation; 2) automatic threshold selection; 3) manual calibration of the threshold selection method for each specific type of cell or nanoparticle images; 4) manual determination of the segmentation cases for each specific type of cell or nanoparticle images; and 5) automatic quantification by iterative morphological erosion. After the parameter, N is calibrated and the segmentation case is determined manually for each specific type of cell or nanoparticle images with one or several typical images; only parts 1), 2), and 5) are needed for the rest of processing and they are automatic. The proposed approach is tested with different types of cell and nanoparticle images.

Automated Detection of DCIS in Whole-Slide H&E Stained Breast Histopathology Images,"This paper presents and evaluates a fully automatic method for detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in digitized hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathological slides of breast tissue. The proposed method applies multi-scale superpixel classification to detect epithelial regions in whole-slide images (WSIs). Subsequently, spatial clustering is utilized to delineate regions representing meaningful structures within the tissue such as ducts and lobules. A region-based classifier employing a large set of features including statistical and structural texture features and architectural features is then trained to discriminate between DCIS and benign/normal structures. The system is evaluated on two datasets containing a total of 205 WSIs of breast tissue. Evaluation was conducted both on the slide and the lesion level using FROC analysis. The results show that to detect at least one true positive in every DCIS containing slide, the system finds 2.6 false positives per WSI. The results of the per-lesion evaluation show that it is possible to detect 80% and 83% of the DCIS lesions in an abnormal slide, at an average of 2.0 and 3.0 false positives per WSI, respectively. Collectively, the result of the experiments demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed method as well as its potential for application in routine pathological diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DCIS detection algorithm working fully automatically on WSIs.",Lesions;Cancer;Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Pathology;Design automation;Breast tissue;Computer-aided diagnosis;DCIS Detection;H&E staining;whole-slide imaging,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2016.2550620
Hermite Snakes With Control of Tangents,"We introduce a new model of parametric contours defined in a continuous fashion. Our curve model relies on Hermite spline interpolation and can easily generate curves with sharp discontinuities; it also grants direct access to the tangent at each location. With these two features, the Hermite snake distinguishes itself from classical spline-snake models and allows one to address certain bioimaging problems in a more efficient way. More precisely, the Hermite snake construction allows introducing sharp corners in the snake curve and designing directional energy functionals relying on local orientation information in the input image. Using the formalism of spline theory, the model is shown to meet practical requirements such as invariance to affine transformations and good approximation properties. Finally, the dependence on initial conditions and the robustness to the noise is studied on synthetic data in order to validate our Hermite snake model, and its usefulness is illustrated on real biological images acquired using brightfield, phase-contrast, differential-interference-contrast, and scanning-electron microscopy.",Splines (mathematics);Interpolation;Biological system modeling;Generators;Active contours;Mathematical model;Image segmentation;Active contours;segmentation;Hermite splines;Hermite interpolation;bioimage analysis,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2016.2551363
Nonlinear Optical Microscopy Captures High-Resolution Images of Microstructures Within Three Types of Unlabeled Rat Cartilage,"Cartilage is one of the most important tissues in mammalian growth and is classified into three types: hyaline, fibro, and elastic. To illustrate its potential as a clinical diagnostic tool, nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) was applied to simultaneously investigate images and spectra from three different types of rat cartilage. High-resolution images were obtained using the two-photon excited fluorescence and second-harmonic generation (SHG) of structures within fresh specimens. Since samples were imaged without hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, detailed observations of tissue morphology and microstructural distribution were obtained without shrinkage or distortion. Nonlinear optical spectra confirmed that elastic cartilage is rich in elastic fibers, of which there are few in both hyaline and fibro cartilages.

Grading of mammalian cumulus oocyte complexes using machine learning for in vitro embryo culture,"Visual observation of Cumulus Oocyte Complexes provides only limited information about its functional competence, whereas the molecular evaluations methods are cumbersome or costly. Image analysis of mammalian oocytes can provide attractive alternative to address this challenge. However, it is complex, given the huge number of oocytes under inspection and the subjective nature of the features inspected for identification. Supervised machine learning methods like random forest with annotations from expert biologists can make the analysis task standardized and reduces inter-subject variability.

Integration of multi-modal biomedical data to predict cancer grade and patient survival,"The Big Data era in Biomedical research has resulted in large-cohort data repositories such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These repositories routinely contain hundreds of matched patient samples for genomic, proteomic, imaging, and clinical data modalities, enabling holistic and multi-modal integrative analysis of human disease. Using TCGA renal and ovarian cancer data, we conducted a novel investigation of multi-modal data integration by combining histopathological image and RNA-seq data. We compared the performances of two integrative prediction methods: majority vote and stacked generalization. Results indicate that integration of multiple data modalities improves prediction of cancer grade and outcome. Specifically, stacked generalization, a method that integrates multiple data modalities to produce a single prediction result, outperforms both single-data-modality prediction and majority vote. Moreover, stacked generalization reveals the contribution of each data modality (and specific features within each data modality) to the final prediction result and may provide biological insights to explain prediction performance.",Cancer;Predictive models;Bioinformatics;Data models;Genomics;Imaging;Junctions,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI),10.1109/BHI.2016.7455963
Keratose as a Novel Drug Carrier for Drug Coated Balloons,"Drug coated balloons (DCB) represent a novel approach to develop a superior intervention for the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Currently, DCB are coated with anti-proliferative drugs which combat neointimal hyperplasia reducing the occurrence of restenosis. The common anti-proliferative drug is paclitaxel, which when coated alone has very poor retention rates due to its diffusion from the treated artery following deployment. Excipients have marginally improved paclitaxel retention however retention rates are still less than 10% 24-hours post-treatment. Keratose, an extracted form of keratin derived from human hair, is a potential option for an excipient due to its intrinsic scaffolding characteristics and biocompatibility. Keratose hydrogels support tunable release of various drugs and factors as a function of keratose concentration. Therefore, the goal of this project is to evaluate the ability of keratose to act as an excipient of paclitaxel in DCB. Briefly, various paclitaxel-containing keratose hydrogels were formed. Keratose degradation and paclitaxel release were quantified up to 45 days by spectrophotometry and HPLC-MS/MS respectively. To confirm the ability of keratose to form a DCB, keratose hydrogels were coated on angioplasty balloons using a dipping technique. The keratose DCB was sectioned and coating thickness was quantified by light microscopy. Results demonstrated that paclitaxel-keratose hydrogels degraded and released paclitaxel as a function of keratose concentration. The keratose DCB displayed uniform coating circumferentially with coating thicknesses ranging from 5-20 microns. These studies highlight the potential of a new biomaterial that can provide a safe and controllable drug release profile for treatment of PAD.",Drugs;Coatings;Degradation;Arteries;Distance measurement;Diseases;Hair,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 32nd Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC),10.1109/SBEC.2016.33
A fuzzy SVM for intelligent diagnosis of solder bumps using scanning acoustic microscopy,"Flip chip technology has been used extensively over the past decades. In this paper, an intelligent diagnosis system for solder bumps based on the scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) has been developed, and a fuzzy support vector machine (F-SVM) algorithm is investigated for defect classification. An ultrasonic transducer of 230MHz is used to capture the image of the flip chip.

Eulerian emotion magnification for subtle expression recognition,"Subtle emotions are expressed through tiny and brief movements of facial muscles, called micro-expressions; thus, recognition of these hidden expressions is as challenging as inspection of microscopic worlds without microscopes. In this paper, we show that through motion magnification, subtle expressions can be realistically exaggerated and become more easily recognisable. We magnify motions of facial expressions in the Eulerian perspective by manipulating their amplitudes or phases. To evaluate effects of exaggerating facial expressions, we use a common framework (LBP-TOP features and SVM classifiers) to perform 5-class subtle emotion recognition on the CASME II corpus, a spontaneous subtle emotion database. According to experimental results, significant improvements in recognition rates of magnified micro-expressions over normal ones are confirmed and measured. Furthermore, we estimate upper bounds of effective magnification factors and empirically corroborate these theoretical calculations with experimental data.",Emotion recognition;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Databases;Videos;Support vector machines;Training;Subtle emotion;Motion magnification;Micro-expression recognition;Classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7471875
Two-Photon Imaging of DiO-Labelled Meissner Corpuscle in Living Mouse's Fingertip,"Meissner corpuscles are the fast adapting type I (FA-I) mechanoreceptor that locates at the dermal papillae of skin. The Meissner corpuscle is well known for its complex structure, consisting of spiral axons, lamellar cells, and a collagen capsule. Fluorescent microscopy has become a convenient method for observing the Meissner corpuscle and its inner structure. This method requires preparing samples with fingertip cross-sections and performing antibody staining before observation. Various kinds of microscopy can be used for observation, such as confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Although the anatomical shape, distribution, and components of Meissner corpuscle are recognized, they have been mostly determined from observations of fixed tissues. Therefore, knowledge of mechanical transduction is limited by the lack of in vivo experiments and individual differences among samples.

Effective Tilting Angles for a Dual Probes AFM System to Achieve High-Precision Scanning,"Because of the everlasting promotion of micro/nanofabrication techniques, the measurement of the feature contour of micro/nanofabricated structures becomes an important issue. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a high accuracy measurement instrument that has been frequently used in measuring of micro/nanofabricated structures. However, most conventional AFM systems use a single probe with a monotonic tilting angle to scan all kinds of sample profiles. This type of AFM design easily suffers from the so-called side wall effect, and the scanning result will induce a distortion phenomenon at the corner part. To solve this problem, a novel dual probe AFM system is proposed in this paper. A highly flexible system structure is adopted in this work to create different tilting angle of each probe. With the method developed for obtaining the appropriate tilting angle, we set up the so-called effective tilting angles under different scanning scenarios. In addition, a useful merging method has been developed to stitch together the scanning results from two different probes out of two different scanning units. For scanning a standard grating, the error of sidewall angle from the scan image decreases from 27.3% to 4.5% when our method is compared with a traditional scan. Finally, by integrating the proposed scan method with a new raster-based local scan strategy, we can achieve a high-throughput precision scan. In the scan of human blood cells, we not only can remove unnecessary scan area up to 61.04%, but also can improve sidewall distortion. A comprehensive series of experiments have been conducted to validate the scanning capability of the proposed methods on our self-developed AFM system.",Probes;Microscopy;Atomic measurements;Force;Surfaces;Optical microscopy;Force measurement;Atomic force microscopy (AFM);dual probe scan;high-precision scanning;local scan strategy;probe tilting angle,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,10.1109/TMECH.2016.2577739
Phytoplankton feature extraction from microscopic images based on SURF-PCA,"Phytoplankton are photosynthesizing microscopic organisms that inhabit the upper sunlit layer of almost all oceans and bodies of fresh water. Its abundance and taxonomic composition have impact on marine ecosystem dynamic and global environment change. Therefore, many researchers pay attention to effectively monitoring phytoplankton quantity and species composition. In order to realize this purpose, phytoplankton recognition using computer vision is now arousing more and more interest. In this paper, we combine two feature extraction methods, including SURF-PCA and LBP-PCA, to identify phytoplankton. SURF has rotational invariance and LBP is a very efficient texture operator. So combining the two algorithms can take advantage of the complementary properties to extract features, and the classification result shows that this approach is fast and can get a high recognition rate. In order to reduce the computational complexity and obtain a higher recognition rate, we use Principal Component Analysis algorithm for the feature dimension reduction. The experiment results demonstrate that our method can reduce computational complexity without loss of accuracy.",Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Oceans;Computer vision;Histograms;Covariance matrices;Training,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,OCEANS 2016 - Shanghai,10.1109/OCEANSAP.2016.7485699
Lung cancer survival prediction from pathological images and genetic data — An integration study,"In this paper, we have proposed a framework for lung cancer survival prediction by integrating genetic data and pathological images. Since molecular profiles and pathological images reveal complementary information on tumor characteristics, the integration will benefit the survival analysis. The gene expression signatures are processed using Model-Based Background Correction method. A robust cell detection and segmentation method is applied to segment each individual cell from pathological images to extract the image features. Based on the cell detection results, a set of extensive features are extracted using efficient geometry and texture descriptors. The supervised principal component regression model is fitted to evaluate the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate strong prediction power of the statistical model built from the integration of genetic data and pathological images compared with using only one of the two types of data alone.",Lungs;Cancer;Feature extraction;Pathology;Genetics;Tumors;Hazards;Lung cancer;Survival prediction;Integration Framework;Genetic Data;Pathological Image,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493475
Supervised method for cell counting from bright field focus stacks,"We present a novel method for cell counting using bright field focus stacks. Our method is based on the use of supervised learning and out-of-focus appearance of cells. Logistic regression was used for classification with intensity values of 25 focal planes as features. Binary erosion with a large circular structuring element was applied as post-processing step. With this simple method we obtained mean F1-score of 0.87 for cell counting with 12 test images, including images of extremely dense populations. The most important features were obtained from out-of-focus images. Thus, we conclude that using several focal planes provides valuable intensity information for cell counting from bright field microscopy.",Microscopy;Training;Logistics;Testing;Mathematical model;Sociology;Microscopy — Light;Confocal;Fluorescence;Cells & molecules;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493290
"Location-specific prediction of vulnerable plaque using IVUS, virtual histology, and spatial context","Early detection of the high-risk lesions such as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) is highly desired in the clinic. Our group recently addressed the task of prediction of future TCFAs based on baseline virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) data with prediction performance not sufficient for routine clinical use. To achieve clinical relevance of our TCFA prediction, an improved strategy is presented here that introduces a spatial context between adjacent IVUS-frame locations and uses a 3-frame TCFA definition. We compared performance of four types of feature set (VH-based, IVUS-based, biomarkers, and combined features), two feature selection approaches (support vector machine recursive feature elimination [SVM RFE] and mutual information [MI]), and two classifiers (SVM and random forests [RF]) when analyzing 24 baseline-follow-up patient datasets. The experimental results indicated that the best prediction performance achieved nearly 10% improvement compared to our previous context-free method — AUC = 0.86, sensitivity=82.6%, specificity=82.1%.",Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Lesions;Atherosclerosis;Training;Biomarkers;Radio frequency;Atherosclerosis;natural history;thin-cap fibroatheroma;prediction,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493518
Cell segmentation in digital holographic images,"Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) is becoming recently very popular for cell imaging. The main advantage of digital holographic microscopy over classical microscopy techniques is that it does not only provide the projected image of the object but also provides three dimensional information of the object's optical thickness. DHM technology could be the core of a label-free imaging for hematology applications. In an ideal framework, a blood sample can be imaged using DHM, machine learning approaches can be used for the cell extraction, differentiation and consequently computing all the relevant blood statistics such as the Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), the Red Blood Cell (RBC) count, Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW). The most vital component in such a framework is accurate extraction of the cells. This paper presents a novel approach to cell segmentation in which a probabilistic boosting tree classifier is trained to detect the centers of the cells using Haar-Features. The detected cell centers are used to trigger a marker-controlled power watershed segmentation to compute the cell boundaries. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of segmentation methods for cell extraction in digital holographic images.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Robustness;Optical microscopy;Boosting;Sensitivity,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493246
Multi-class single-label classification of histopathological whole-slide images,"Digitizing histopathological slides into whole-slide images enables the use of image analysis techniques for a comprehensive study of diseases at tissue level. In this work, we investigate possible configurations of classifiers and features to classify entire tissue slides. Feature candidates are first evaluated individually and then combined to form a strong classifier. For evaluation of this nine-class problem we use one sparsely and one densely extracted data set to obtain a conservative and an optimistic estimate of the performance. To this end, the best results in terms of overall accuracy (86.6%) and F1-score (67.8%) are achieved by a Random Forest classifier with a Color-Histogram feature.",Tumors;Feature extraction;Histograms;Support vector machines;Image color analysis;Training;Prostate cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493527
Recursive water flow: A shape decomposition approach for cell clump splitting,"We propose a hierarchical method for splitting cell clumps into individual cells which we call Recursive Water Flow (rwf). For the segmentation of cells in histological images we first apply foreground segmentation leading to connected regions of clumping cells. rwf defines one-dimensional cost-functions along paths on the skeleton of these regions. In particular, we collect split-relevant information along geodesic paths between skeleton end-points. This framework allows to exploit combined shape and intensity information for identifying optimal split positions and recursively decomposing the clumps into single distinct cells. Results show that our framework helps to improve cell segmentation performance in contrast to splitting based on local geometrical clues.",Image segmentation;Skeleton;Shape;Cost function;Transforms;Labeling;Measurement uncertainty;Cell Segmentation;Clump Splitting;Histological Images,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493390
First step for computer assisted evaluation of qualitative supersonic shear wave elastography characteristics in breast tissue,"The addition of shear wave elastography (SWE) imaging to standard B-mode ultrasound assessment supports the differential diagnosis of solid breast lesions. One way to assess SWE images is qualitative evaluation of the stiffness pattern according to the Tozaki classification. Until now this qualitative assessment has only been possible manually and so has low reproducibility and high inter-observer variability. Thus, this work aims to investigate the feasibility of automatic assessment of Tozaki categories. SWE images of 41 solid breast lesions (9 benign, 32 malignant) were assessed manually by a radiologist and automatically. The results were compared to the histology of the lesions. The diagnostic performance of the automatic assessment is similar to the manual assessment. The algorithm introduced in this work demonstrates the ability to automatically assess qualitative SWE features, given segmented lesions, according to the Tozaki classification.",Lesions;Breast;Image segmentation;Elasticity;Ultrasonic imaging;Manuals;Imaging;Computer assisted diagnosis;ultrasound;elastography;breast;cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493312
Automatic recognition and characterization of different non-parenchymal cells in liver tissue,"Understanding how cells form tissues is an essential component in systems biology that involves the generation of tissue models. Generating such a tissue model requires a proper reconstruction of the different cells forming the tissue visualized as fluorescent objects in microscopy images. This is limited by the number of fluorescent markers that can be simultaneously imaged in a tissue sample (up to 4-5 by confocal microscopy). This limitation can be overcome by using automatic algorithms for the recognition of the different cell types without the use of specific markers. In this study, we propose a toolbox of algorithms for an accurate identification, reconstruction and characterization of different cells types in 3D tissue images. We applied our toolbox to the recognition of sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), Kupffer and Stellate cells in adult mouse liver tissue. The cell recognition algorithm was based on the morphology, texture and relative localization of the nuclei. The analysis of the most relevant parameters used for cell classification gave new insights into liver cell structure and function. In particular, nuclear shape, distance to cell borders, chromatin texture and proximity to sinusoids were the most important parameters for the non-parenchymal liver cells classification.",Image reconstruction;Liver;Three-dimensional displays;Microscopy;Shape;Bayes methods;Feature extraction;3D Tissue reconstruction;cell classification;nucleus morphology;Linear Discriminant Analysis;Bayesian Network Classifier,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493325
Tracking of microtubules in anisotropic volumes of neural tissue,"For both the automatic and manual reconstruction of neural circuits from electron microscopy (EM) images, the detection and identification of intracellular structures provide useful cues. This is particularly true for microtubules which are indicative of the scaffold of neuronal morphology. However, to our knowledge, the automated reconstruction of microtubules from EM images of neural tissue has received no attention so far. In this paper, we present an automatic method for the tracking of microtubules in 3D EM volumes of neural tissue. We formulate an energy-based model on short candidate segments of microtubules found by a local classifier. We enumerate and score possible links between candidates, in order to find a cost-minimal subset of candidates and links by solving an integer linear program. The model provides a way to incorporate biological priors including both hard constraints (e.g. microtubules are topologically chains of links) and soft constraints (e.g. high curvature is unlikely). We test our method on a challenging EM dataset of Drosophila neural tissue and show that our model reliably tracks microtubules spanning many image sections.",Neurons;Image reconstruction;Biological system modeling;Trajectory;Three-dimensional displays;Image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493275
Experiments in molecular subtype recognition based on histopathology images,"Molecular subtypes have been recently derived for various types of cancer, in an attempt to characterize the intertumoral heterogeneity. In this work we explore the possibility of constructing predictors for molecular subtypes based on histopathology images. For this, we introduce a novel 2-level bag-of-features method and we apply it to a collection of colorectal cancer samples. The resulting image features capture some relevant tumor morphology patterns and led to a classifier performing similarly to one constructed from features annotated by an expert pathologist. The significance of our results extends beyond subtype prediction since they demonstrate a possible approach to multimodal (histopathology and molecular) data mining and biomarker identification.",Image coding;Pathology;Histograms;Cancer;Tumors;Gene expression;Encoding;histopathology imaging;classification;gastrointestinal tract,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493474
An improved hybrid active contour model for nuclear segmentation on breast cancer histopathology,"Segmentation of nuclei on breast cancer histopathological images is considered a basic and essential step for diagnosis in a computer-aided diagnosis framework. Nuclear segmentation remains a challenging problem due to the inherent diversity of cancer biology and the variability of the tissue appearance. We present an automatic nuclear segmentation method using an improved hybrid active contour (AC) model driven by both boundary and region information. The initialization of segmentation based on morphological operations and watershed allows for generation of initial closed curves and reduction in computational load of curve evolution for the AC model. Color gradients are computed to capture image gradients along the margin of nucleus. The AC segmentation scheme is performed in a coarse-to-fine fashion which can help to solve the problem of multiple object overlap in an image scene. Segmentation performance was evaluated on various breast cancer histopathological images with different grades and was compared with the existing popular AC models, suggesting that our improved hybrid active contour model can be used to build an accurate and robust nuclear segmentation tool.",Image segmentation;Computational modeling;Breast cancer;Mathematical model;Active contours;Solid modeling;Image color analysis;hybrid active contour model;nuclear segmentation;breast cancer;histopathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493471
Phenotypic characterization of breast invasive carcinoma via transferable tissue morphometric patterns learned from glioblastoma multiforme,"Quantitative analysis of whole slide images (WSIs) in a large cohort may provide predictive models of clinical outcome. However, the performance of the existing techniques is hindered as a result of large technical variations (e.g., fixation, staining) and biological heterogeneities (e.g., cell type, cell state) that are always present in a large cohort. Although unsupervised feature learning provides a promising way in learning pertinent features without human intervention, its capability can be greatly limited due to the lack of well-curated examples. In this paper, we explored the transferability of knowledge acquired from a well-curated Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) dataset through its application to the representation and characterization of tissue histology from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) cohort. Our experimental results reveals two major phenotypic subtypes with statistically significantly different survival curves. Further differential expression analysis of these two subtypes indicates enrichment of genes regulated by NF-kB in response to TNF and genes up-regulated in response to IFNG.",Tumors;Computer architecture;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Microprocessors;Breast;Cancer;Breast invasive carcinoma;unsupervised feature learning;knowledge sharing;predictive sparse decomposition;consensus clustering;survival analysis;enrichment analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493440
Active appearance segmentation for intensity inhomogeneity in light sheet fluorescence microscopy,Active Appearance Models (AAM) are used for annotating or segmenting shapes in biomedical images. Performance relies heavily on the image data used to train the AAM. In this paper we improve the generalization properties of the model by making it robust to slowly varying spatial intensity inhomogeneities which are often seen in Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) images. This robustness is achieved by modelling the appearance of an image as a regularized Normalized Gradient Field (rNGF). We perform two experiments to challenge the model. First it is tested using a repeated leave-one-out approach on images with minimal imperfections where the left out images are corrupted by a simulated bias field and segmented using the AAM. Secondly we test the model on LSFM images with common acquisition problems. In both experiments the proposed approach outperforms the often used AAM implementation based on Sum of Squared Differences.,Shape;Active appearance model;Image segmentation;Distortion;Brain modeling;Mice;Training;Active Appearance Model;regularized Normalized Gradient Field;Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy;Segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493248
"An automatic breast cancer grading method in histopathological images based on pixel-, object-, and semantic-level features","We present an automatic breast cancer grading method in histopathological images based on the computer extracted pixel-, object-, and semantic-level features derived from convolutional neural networks (CNN). The multiple level features allow not only characterization of nuclear polymorphism, but also extraction of structural and interpretable information within the images. In this study, a hybrid level set based segmentation method was used to segment nuclei from the images. A quantile normalization approach was utilized to improve image color consistency. The semantic level features are extracted by a CNN approach, which describe the proportions of nuclei belonging to the different grades, in conjunction with pixel-level (texture) and object-level (structure) features, to form an integrated set of attributes. A support vector machine classifier was trained to discriminate the breast cancer between low, intermediate, and high grades. The results demonstrated that our method achieved accuracy of 0.90 (low vs. high), and 0.74 (low vs. intermediate), and 0.76 (intermediate vs. high), suggesting that the present method could play a fundamental role in developing a computer-aided breast cancer grading system.",Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Image segmentation;Support vector machines;Image color analysis;Neurons;breast cancer grading;multi-level features;convolutional neural networks;histopathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493470
Robust cell segmentation for histological images of Glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with uniformly dismal prognosis. Quantitative analysis of GBM cells is an important avenue to extract latent histologic disease signatures to correlate with molecular underpinnings and clinical outcomes. As a prerequisite, a robust and accurate cell segmentation is required. In this paper, we present an automated cell segmentation method that can satisfactorily address segmentation of overlapped cells commonly seen in GBM histology specimens. This method first detects cells with seed connectivity, distance constraints, image edge map, and a shape-based voting image. Initialized by identified seeds, cell boundaries are deformed with an improved variational level set method that can handle clumped cells. We test our method on 40 histological images of GBM with human annotations.

Non-rigid registration and robust principal component analysis with variation priors: A high-throughput mouse phenotyping approach,"Intensive global efforts are underway towards phenotyping the mouse genome, by systematically knocking out all «25,000 genes for comparative study. Analytical work of this scale easily overwhelms the traditional method using histological examination, leading to a significant demand for high-throughput approaches, especially via image informatics to efficiently identify phenotypes concerning morphological anomaly. We propose a high-throughput batch-wise anomaly detection framework without prior knowledge of the phenotype and the need for segmentation. Anomaly detection is centered on feature decomposition using robust principal component analysis (RPCA), which has previously been applied to many computer vision domains. However, baseline RPCA does not work well in the biomedical domain due to substantial natural variation in imaging data. In contrast, we develop a modified version (RPCA-P) that incorporates variation priors, coupled with non-rigid image registration to achieve this goal.",Mice;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Standards;Image registration;Mouse phenotyping;anomaly detection;robust principal component analysis (RPCA);natural variation;non-rigid image registration,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493462
Automatic segmentation of lung carcinoma in histological images using a visual dictionary,"The quantification of remaining vital tumor tissue in patients undergoing chemo-/radiotherapy is necessary to assess the response to treatment. In this work, we present an automatic segmentation of pan-cytokeratin stained histological images of non-small cell lung carcinoma, which provides the ratio of vital vs. necrotic tumor tissue. The proposed method learns from training patches of vital and necrotic tissues, from which a set of features are extracted. Image superpixels are then labeled according to their nearest neighbors in the training feature space. Segmentation results were quantitatively assessed using leave-one-out tests. The proposed method achieved average sensitivity (specificity) of 91% (95%) and 73% (96%) for vital tumor epithelia and necrosis, respectively.",Tumors;Image segmentation;Lungs;Dictionaries;Sensitivity;Image color analysis;Visualization;Histopathology imaging;lung cancer;segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493443
Segmentation of developing human embryo in time-lapse microscopy,"Being able to efficiently segment a developing embryo from background clutter constitutes an important step in automated monitoring of human embryonic cells. State-of-the-art automatic segmentation methods remain ill-suited to handle the complex behavior and morphological variance of non-stained embryos. By contrast, while effective, manual approaches are impractically time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to segment human embryo in early-stage development from a sequence of dark field microscopy images. In particular, we express segmentation as an energy minimization problem, which can be solved efficiently via graph-cuts or dynamic programming. Our experiments on twenty embryo sequences demonstrates that our method can successfully segment complex and irregular embryo structures in time-lapse microscopy (TLM) sequences.",Embryo;Image segmentation;Shape;Image edge detection;Microscopy;Labeling;Random variables,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493417
Nonparametric joint shape and feature priors for segmentation of dendritic spines,"Multimodal shape density estimation is a challenging task in many biomedical image segmentation problems. Existing techniques in the literature estimate the underlying shape distribution by extending Parzen density estimator to the space of shapes. Such density estimates are only expressed in terms of distances between shapes which may not be sufficient for ensuring accurate segmentation when the observed intensities provide very little information about the object boundaries. In such scenarios, employing additional shape-dependent discriminative features as priors and exploiting both shape and feature priors can aid to the segmentation process. In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm that uses nonparametric joint shape and feature priors using Parzen density estimator. The joint prior density estimate is expressed in terms of distances between shapes and distances between features. We incorporate the learned joint shape and feature prior distribution into a maximum a posteriori estimation framework for segmentation. The resulting optimization problem is solved using active contours. We present experimental results on dendritic spine segmentation in 2-photon microscopy images which involve a multimodal shape density.",Shape;Image segmentation;Training;Head;Magnetic heads;Neck;Feature extraction;Nonparametric joint shape and feature priors;Parzen density estimator;multimodal shape density;dendritic spine segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493279
Estimation of sludge volume index (SVI) using bright field activated sludge images,"Image processing and analysis is a potential tool for monitoring of activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. One of the important parameters to track the performance of activated sludge plant is sludge volume index (SVI). In this paper, image analysis based modeling is used to estimate the sludge volume index. Bright field microscopic images of activated sludge were segmented by integrating four algorithms to skim any possible failures of any of them. The morphological parameters for activated sludge flocs have been extracted from the segmented images. Seven classes were identified for image analysis parameters with respect to range of equivalent diameter of activated sludge flocs. The process resulted into 134 image analysis parameters and seven classes. The feature selection is done by two procedures: correlation method and stepwise linear regression. The stepwise linear regression is automated process which selected 6 parameters with adjusted correlation of 95.1%. The results showed that image analysis based modeling with as small as six parameters can be used to predict the sludge volume index. Finally, three out of seven classes are identified which can contribute to the estimation of SVI.",Correlation;Image analysis;Image segmentation;Linear regression;Estimation;Indexes;Algorithm design and analysis;Activated sludge;Image segmentation;Image analysis;Feature selection,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference Proceedings,10.1109/I2MTC.2016.7520397
Segmentation of dendritic cells from microscopic images using mathematical morphology,"For many years, biologists have been interested in toxicology to assess the effects of contamination on humans. In recent years, researchers have found a new evaluation technique based on the analysis of dendritic cells in vitro. Up to now the analysis conducted on these cells remains purely visual in nature. Therefore, it is subjective and time-consuming because of the different morphological features of the cells. Here, we suggest to use automatic processing techniques by image analysis. The foremost goal of this paper is to suggest an assessment tool for the analysis of immunotoxic effects of food contaminants (mycotoxins) on the immune system using automatic segmentation techniques of microscopic images of dendritic cells. The suggested method is based on automatic thresholding and mathematical morphology. For validation purposes, an experimental study is carried out on 55 microscopic images of dendritic cells visually analyzed by an expert in order to make comparisons or to have a reference segmentation of the cells. Results show that the proposed approach is efficient in identifying dendritic cells with a segmentation accuracy of 95%.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Morphology;Image color analysis;Immune system;Electronic mail;dendritic cells;morphology;segmentation;mathematical morphology,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 2nd International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Signal and Image Processing (ATSIP),10.1109/ATSIP.2016.7523116
Mapping of Au/a-IGZO Schottky contacts by using scanning internal photoemission microscopy,"Summary form only given. We have demonstrated scanning internal photoemission microscopy to characterize degradation of Au/amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O Schottky contacts. After applying a reverse voltage stress of -30 V, the current-voltage characteristics became leaky and a local degradation of the contacts was clearly visualized in a photocurrent image, while no symptom of the degradation was observed in the optical microscope image. In addition, it was found that Schottky barrier height decreased by 0.1 eV in the degraded region. We thus conclude that this method gives quantitative and visual information on underlying thin-film transparency metal/semiconductor interface.",Schottky barriers;Degradation;Photoelectricity;Scanning electron microscopy;Optical microscopy;Visualization,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 Compound Semiconductor Week (CSW) [Includes 28th International Conference on Indium Phosphide & Related Materials (IPRM) & 43rd International Symposium on Compound Semiconductors (ISCS),10.1109/ICIPRM.2016.7528798
A Compact Laser Imaging System for Concurrent Reflectance Confocal Microscopy and Laser Doppler Flowmetry,"We propose a compact laser feedback interferometry imaging system for concurrent reflectance confocal microscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry. This system acquires both confocal reflectance and Doppler signals in a confocal architecture to image dynamic turbid media with higher contrast than a system operating in either modality and is coherent in nature. In a confocal optical configuration, reflectance confocal microscopy provides information about scattering from within a small volume centered around the focal point of the confocal system, and laser Doppler flowmetry provides information about the velocity of moving scatterers within the same volume. Raster scanning the sample enables the concurrent creation of two images, containing independent information, from a well-specified depth within the sample. Concurrent spatial mapping of these independent sensing modalities affords improvement in the capability of the imaging system by obtaining additional information from both morphological and functional features of the dynamic turbid medium at depths penetrable by near-infrared lasers. We realize the idea using a laser feedback interferometry imaging system scanning a microfluidic channel that contains a dynamic turbid medium. We show the effectiveness of this integrated imager quantitatively through the improvement of the signal-to-background ratio of a combined (multiplication) image.",Doppler effect;Optical imaging;Optical scattering;Biomedical optical imaging;Laser beams;Laser feedback;Confocal reflectance microscopy;laser doppler velocimetry;laser feedback interferometry;near-infrared laser imaging,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Photonics Journal,10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2599014
A Web-Based Tool for Semi-Automated Segmentation of Histopathological Images Using Nonlinear Color Classifiers,"Histopathological staining is a technique widely used to highlight biological states or pharmacological activities in uman tissue. A quantitative analysis of the resulting images can produce biomarkers for diseases or even other specific conditions, thus providing valuable information for diagnosis and prognosis. Since biomarkers require measurements to be made in an objective and consistent way, software systems are employed to provide this quantitative analysis. For measurements to be reproducible, the same methods must be available across different laboratories. In this paper, we present a tool that allows users to perform quantitative analyses over the web, thus providing an efficient environment not only for individual cases to be evaluated, but also for users to share a common ground when making measurements. The classification method used by the tool to segment stained pixels is performed by a similarity function based on the polynomial version of the Mahalanobis distance, which is nonlinear and provides very robust classification for m-dimensional feature spaces. Furthermore, the similarity function can be generalized in the tool, so that images can be classified by reusing parameters of previous cases. The results of our web-based approach were compared with established ground-truth data sets, producing sensitivity, specificity and fitness values of 97.09%, 98.70%, and 97.90%.",Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Biomarkers;Sensitivity;Inspection;Servers;Statistical analysis;Semi-automated biomarker identification;Immunohistochemistry image;Web-Based Approach;Telepathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 29th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),10.1109/CBMS.2016.30
Early Experiences in Using Blood Cells Biomembranes as Markers for Diabetes Diagnosis,"Investigation of membrane fluidity by two photon fluorescence microscopy opens up a new and important area of translational research, being a useful and sensitive method for disease monitoring and treatment. In this paper we investigate if biomembranes in human red blood cells (RBC) and peripheral mononuclear cells (PMC) could be used as markers for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) diagnosis, leading to the development of a method for monitoring T1DM progression that nowadays is lacking, as clinical exams cannot pursue this task with enough reliability. To this aim, we present a set of features computed from PMC and RBC images that are given to a multi-experts system leveraging on multi-spectral information for positive/negative classifications. The experiments are carried out on a dataset of 800 blood cell images belonging to 18 subjects adopting the leave-one-person-out approach.",Biomembranes;Cells (biology);Monitoring;Blood;Diseases;Training;Principal component analysis;Type 1 Diabetes;Two photon microscopy;Image processing;Feature extraction;Machine learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 29th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),10.1109/CBMS.2016.60
Gland segmentation from histology images using informative morphological scale space,"Grading of cancer offers insight to the occurrence and progress of the disease. The course of treatment is planned depending on the grade of cancer. Segmentation of the glandular structure of tissue is a prerequisite for grading of colon, prostate and breast cancers. Manual segmentation method is time-consuming and suffers from the curse of observer bias. We propose an automated solution for gland segmentation from hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained histology images. Our method relies on the biological cue rather than gland specific signatures that may vary across the slides. We construct a novel informative morphological scale space for gland segmentation. The scale space uses the entropy of the connected components in a novel manner to prevent over segmentation of objects. Our solution is fast, accurate and applicable in a clinical setup. Experiments show an average F1 score of 0.68 for 85 histology images in 20x magnification. We obtain ~ 30% improvement in F1 score compared to the area morphological scale space method.",Glands;Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Entropy;Cancer;Observers;Mercury (metals);Gland segmentation;informative morphological scale space;edge preserving filter,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2016.7533135
Stem cell microscopic image segmentation using supervised normalized cuts,"A vast amount of toxicological data can be obtained from feature analysis of cells treated in vitro. However, this requires microscopic image segmentation of cells. To this end, we propose a new strategy, namely Supervised Normalized Cut Segmentation (SNCS), to segment cells that partially overlap and have a large amount of curved edges. SNCS approach is a machine learning based method, where loosely annotated images are used first to train and optimise parameters, and then the optimal parameters are inserted into a Normalized Cut segmentation process. Furthermore, we compare our segmentation results using SNCS to another four classical and two state-of-the-art methods. The overall experimental result shows the usefulness and effectiveness of our method over the six comparison methods.",Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Training;Stem cells;Microscopy;Joining processes;Biomedical imaging;Image Segmentation;Stem Cells;Machine Learning;Supervised Normalized Cut,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2016.7533139
Automatic quantification and classification of cervical cancer via Adaptive Nucleus Shape Modeling,"Decisions about cervical cancer diagnosis and classification currently require microscopic examination of cervical tissue by an expert pathologist. In the present study, which focused on full automation of this approach, we solely use nucleus-level features to classify tissues as normal or cancer. We propose Adaptive Nucleus Shape Modeling (ANSM) algorithm for nucleus-level analysis which consists of two steps to capture the nucleus-level information: adaptive multilevel thresholding segmentation; and shape approximation by ellipse fitting. After applying the proposed algorithm, the features are extracted for tissue classification. Experiments show that ANSM can achieve an accuracy of 93.33% with a false negative rate of zero in classifying cancer and healthy cervical tissues using nucleus texture features. This provides evidence that nucleus-level analysis is valuable in cervical histology image analysis.",Image segmentation;Shape;Feature extraction;Cancer;Pathology;Support vector machines;Adaptation models,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532841
Application of the methods of dynamic light scattering and light microscopy for determining the particle size of the solid phase during the crystallization of salts,This work is devoted to determining the size of the particles of calcium carbonate by utilizing two independent instrumental methods (dynamic light scattering and light microscopy) in the range of 0.8 nm and 0.1 mm during the process of crystallization. The dependence of particle size on the time allows to determine the kinetic parameters and energy characteristics of induction periods and crystallization.

A trichotomie technique to separate overlapped nuclei in microscopic cancer images,"Ability to clearly delineate the nuclei of microscopic cancer cells is crucial to the accuracy and efficiency of image-based approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Oftentimes, however, such cells contain overlapped (or touched) nuclei. The study proposed in this work presents a hybrid trichotomic technique that combines the Gram-Schmidt method (GSM), handling of relevant geometric features of the cell nuclei, and application of the K-means clustering algorithm to segment, detect, and separate touched nuclei in microscopic cancer images. Using a dataset of microscopic images from two datasets comprising of breast cancer cells and acute lymphoblastic leukemia the proposed technique achieves average mean square error (MSE) of 0.087 and 0.075 for the two datatypes, respectively. Utilising the K-means clustering algorithm in the separation phase of the proposed technique ensures an average normalized accuracy of 0.73 and 0.91 respectively in terms of the nuclei separation for the microscopic breast cancer and acute lymphocyte leukemia cell images in comparison to manual approaches.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Breast cancer;Clustering algorithms;GSM;Image color analysis;medical image processing;disease diagnosis;Gram-Schmidt method;K-Means clustering algorithm;nuclei segmentation;microscopic cancer images;touched nuclei detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 SAI Computing Conference (SAI),10.1109/SAI.2016.7555997
kNN Classification Based Erythrocyte Separation in Microscopic Images of Thin Blood Smear,"In this proposed work, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier comprising of three features i.e. area, compactness ratio, aspect ratio is used to separate the isolated and compound erythrocytes present in microscopic images of thin blood smear. In the microscopic image of thin blood smear, blood components such as erythrocytes, platelets etc are available which is used for diagnostic approach to blood disorder. In the microscopic image, both the isolated and compound erythrocytes are also present. Compound erythrocyte is formed due to overlapping of two or more erythrocytes. In malaria diagnosis, parasitaemia estimation is done which define the ratio of infected erythrocytes related to total number of erythrocytes in microscopic image. For proper quantification of erythrocyte, erythrocytes need to be separated as isolated cell and compound cell. As isolated cells directly count in the counting system and compound cells are further analysed to determine number of erythrocytes. The proposed method to separate the isolated and compound cell provides an average accuracy of ~0.942. It is observed that the proposed method can effectively separate the cells in comparison to some of the existing methods.",Blood;Microscopy;Diseases;Compounds;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Error analysis;Erythrocyte;Microscopic Image;Cell Separation;k-nearest neighbors (kNN),INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Networks (CINE),10.1109/CINE.2016.19
Segmentation of mitochondria based on SEM images,"Recently, due to the rapid development of scanning electron microscope (SEM) with its very high resolution in three dimensions, we can look more closely into those fine structures related to brain function. However, high resolution will inevitably produce huge amounts of data. Considerable attention has been paid for the automated data analysis, which is massively lagging behind data acquisition. In this paper, we focus on the segmentation of mitochondria for its important role in neural function and its homogeneous shape as preferably corresponding landmarks for image registration. Different from previous methods, we present a coarse-to-fine strategy which utilizes the adaptive boosting (Adaboost) algorithm for detection, multi-layer information fusion for the connection across adjacent sections, and sparse region growing for fine segmentation. Finally we show the 3D visualization in ImageJ.

Automated detection of live cells and microspheres in low contrast bright field microscopy,"Automated robotic manipulation of micro scale objects using optical tweezers requires processing of workspace images to extract real-time information on the positions and orientations of the objects. This information is particularly challenging to extract in workspaces comprising mixture of biological and inanimate objects, such as live cells and microspheres, when the popular imaging modality of low contrast bright field microscopy is used. To address this challenge, we present a robust image processing method that uses a novel combination of well-known processing techniques that have been successfully used in other contexts. Results on time-lapse microscopy images show that our method works well on objects of both regular and irregular shapes, is able to distinguish between object types, and accurately detects object configurations even when they are located in close proximities to each other.",Image edge detection;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Holography;Holographic optical components;Shape,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 International Conference on Manipulation, Automation and Robotics at Small Scales (MARSS)",10.1109/MARSS.2016.7561703
Classifying breast cancer regions in microscopic image using texture features,"This study proposes and evaluates the application of two classifiers: decision tree (DT) and neural network (NN) to discriminate three region types: cancer (CC), lymphocyte (LC), and stromal (SC) in the breast cancer cell images. The feature extraction from area based texture information of BCCI is studied to compare results from the segmented cells. A combination between texture features based on energy information and fractal dimension (FD) is used as the feature extraction. One-hundred forty-one images of CC, 23 images of SC and 21 images of LC are analyzed. Results of the p values obtained from analysis-of-variance indicate that the difference between mean of three regions from FD feature and entropy feature are statistically less significant than other features. The classification accuracies obtained from NN and DT is 94.05% and 95.14%, respectively. The results show the feasibility of the proposed method in classifying the histological structures in breast cancer cell image and can be used for improving the cell counting accuracy in the computer-aided system.",Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Artificial neural networks;Image color analysis;Entropy;Microscopy;decision tree;neural network;texture feature;breast cancer cells;image classification;quantitative pathology;co-occurrence matrix,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)",10.1109/ECTICon.2016.7561248
Segmentation and localization of epithelial cells in the histopathological images of stomach adenocarcinoma,"Histopathological examination of the stomach tissue samples visually by a pathologist is the confirmatory test available for stomach cancer diagnosis. As the manual interpretation is subjected to inter and intra-observer variability, an objective analysis is the subject of concern in the current scenario. Architectural analysis of the tissue samples proved to be effective in the diagnosis and grading of adenocarcinoma. The effectiveness of this kind of computer aided diagnosis and grading is greatly dependent on the exact localization of the individual epithelial cells of the glandular region. In this work an efficient and simple morphological operations were formulated for epithelial cell localization.

Air samples are collected on the glass slides and then placed these samples under microscopic camera and images of air samples are obtained. Pre processing techniques, as images have noise regions and spores boundaries are not clear, have been applied and different filters have been used.

Robust Nanoparticles Detection From Noisy Background by Fusing Complementary Image Information,"This paper studies the problem of detecting the presence of nanoparticles in noisy transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images and then fitting each nanoparticle with an elliptic shape model. In order to achieve robustness while handling low contrast and high noise in the TEM images, we propose an approach to fuse two kinds of complementary image information, namely, the pixel intensity and the gradient (the first derivative in intensity). Our approach entails two main steps: 1) the first step is to, after necessary pre-processing, employ both intensity-based information and gradient-based information to process the same TEM image and produce two independent sets of results and 2) the subsequent step is to formulate a binary integer programming (BIP) problem for conflict resolution among the two sets of results. Solving the BIP problem determines the final nanoparticle identification. We apply our method to a set of TEM images taken under different microscopic resolutions and noise levels. The empirical results show the merit of the proposed method. It can process a TEM image of 1024×1024 pixels in a few minutes, and the processed outcomes appear rather robust.",Nanoparticles;Image segmentation;Pipelines;Noise measurement;Shape;Image resolution;Robustness;Binary integer programming;complementary information fusion;image segmentation;multi-expert system;nanoparticle analysis,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2016.2614127
A systematic approach for glandular structure segmentation from colon histopathology images,"In this paper a method is proposed for segmenting glandular structures from Haematoxilyn and Eosin stained colon histopathology images. Gland includes three main structures: lumen, cytoplasm and cell nuclei. As the first step of the algorithm, k-means clustering algorithm is applied to cluster images to 3 clusters (lumen, cytoplasm and cell nuclei). Then, all lumen in each histopathology images are extracted. A set of textural and structural features are extracted from each lumen. Cytoplasm that are adjacent to each lumens are detected. Then a set of textural and structural features are extracted from each cytoplasm. At the next step, cell nuclei rings that are adjacent to each cytoplasm are detected. Then a set of textural and structural features are extracted from each cell nuclei rings. Three feature that extracted from lumen, cytoplasm and cell nuclei rings are combined as a feature vector. The extracted features are then fed into an SVM classifier with a RBF kernel.

Dermatological disease detection using image processing and machine learning,"Dermatological diseases are the most prevalent diseases worldwide. Despite being common, its diagnosis is extremely difficult and requires extensive experience in the domain. In this research paper, we provide an approach to detect various kinds of these diseases. We use a dual stage approach which effectively combines Computer Vision and Machine Learning on clinically evaluated histopathological attributes to accurately identify the disease. In the first stage, the image of the skin disease is subject to various kinds of pre-processing techniques followed by feature extraction. The second stage involves the use of Machine learning algorithms to identify diseases based on the histopathological attributes observed on analysing of the skin.

Automated morphometric description of human corneal endothelium from in-vivo specular and confocal microscopy,"Corneal images acquired by in-vivo specular and confocal microscopy provide clinical information on the cornea endothelium health state. Indeed, the normal hexagonal shape of endothelial cells is usually affected by age and pathologies. At present, the analysis is based on manual or semi-automatic methods and the segmentation of a large number of endothelial cells is required for a meaningful estimation of the clinical parameters. We propose an automated method that detects the centers of endothelial cells by convolving the original image with customized two-dimensional kernels, derives a structure made by connected vertices from the recognized centers using the Euclidean distance, and fine-tunes the derived structure through a genetic algorithm, which combines information about the typical regularity of endothelial cells shape with the pixels intensity of the actual image. The final structure of connected vertices forms a set of polygons that fit the underlying cells contours. From these contours the morphometric parameters of clinical interest can be easily computed. The procedure was applied to 15 images acquired with the SP-3000P (Topcon, Japan) specular microscope and 15 images acquired with the Confoscan4 (Nidek Technologies, Italy) confocal microscope, from both healthy and pathological subjects. Ground truth values for the morphometric parameters were obtained from manually carefully drawn cell contours. Results show that the mean percent absolute difference between the automated and the manual estimate of the clinical parameters is between 2 and 6%, and no statistically significant difference was found between them. The proposed totally automatic method appears capable of detecting contour of hundreds of cells covering a large area, and of obtaining a reliable estimation of the relevant morphometric parameters used in clinical practice.",Microscopy;Estimation;Manuals;Image segmentation;Reliability;Shape;Genetic algorithms,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590944
Combined reconstruction of atrial morphology and paracardial fat depositions to study remodeling in atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent sustained cardiac arrhythmia. AF is shown to be a progressive disease, which is strongly associated with important structural (morphological and histological), electrical and mechanical remodeling of the left atrium (LA). Adipose tissue accumulation has been shown to be a risk factor in AF. We set out to explore the connection between adipose tissue coverage of the LA surface, for both the complete LA and specific regions and the progression of AF. In this study we propose a methodology to study the regional coverage of the left-atrial wall with adipose tissue based on magnetic resonance data. Validation was performed in a sheep model. While the total amount of left-atrial adipose tissue was higher in the sheep with AF, no changes in regional coverage were observed.",Surface reconstruction;Image reconstruction;Fats;Animals;Imaging;Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590745
Learning to distinguish cerebral vasculature data from mechanical chatter in India-ink images acquired using knife-edge scanning microscopy,"We introduce a simple, yet effective, procedure for accurate classification of connected components embedded in biological images. In our method, a training set is generated from user-delineated features of manually-labeled examples; we subsequently train a classifier using the resultant training set. The overall process is described using imaging data acquired from an India-ink perfused C57BL/6J mouse brain using Knife Edge Scanning Microscopy. We illustrate the procedure through segmentation of cerebral vasculature structures from mechanical noise using trained classifiers. The features extracted by our procedure show high discriminatory power between classes; the classifiers (linear SVM, Gaussian SVM, and GentleBoost decision tree ensemble) trained using these features achieved high performance: F1-scores reported for linear SVM, Gaussian SVM, and GentleBoost decision tree ensemble were 0.963, 0.956, and 0.963 respectively.",Support vector machines;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Decision trees;Training;Mice,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591601
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can differentiate high grade and low grade prostatic carcinoma,"Prostate tumors are graded by the revised Gleason Score (GS) which is the sum of the two predominant Gleason grades present ranging from 6-10. GS 6 cancer exclusively with Gleason grade 3 is designated as low grade (LG) and correlates with better clinical prognosis for patients. GS >7 cancer with at least one of the Gleason grades 4 and 5 is designated as HG indicate worse prognosis for patients. Current transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies often fail to correctly diagnose HG prostate cancer due to sampling errors. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of biological tissue depend on tissue morphology and architecture. Thus, DRS could potentially differentiate between HG and LG prostatic carcinoma. A 15-gauge optical biopsy needle was prototyped to take prostate biopsies after measuring DRS with a laboratory fluorometer. This needle has an optical sensor that utilizes 8×100 μm optical fibers for tissue excitation and a single 200 μm central optical fiber to measure DRS. Tissue biopsy cores were obtained from 20 surgically excised prostates using this needle after measuring DRS at 5 nm intervals between 500-700 nm wavelengths. Tissue within a measurement window was histopathologically classified as either benign, LG, or HG and correlated with DRS. Partial least square analysis of DRS identified principal components (PC) as potential classifiers. Statistically significant PCs (p<;0.05) were tested for their ability to classify biopsy tissue using support vector machine and leave-one-out cross validation method. There were 29 HG and 49 LG cancers among 187 biopsy cores included in the study. Study results show 76% sensitivity, 80% specificity, 93% negative predictive value, and 50% positive predictive value for HG versus benign, and 76%, 73%, 84%, and 63%, for HG versus LG prostate tissue classification. DRS failed to diagnose 7/29 (24%) HG cancers. This study demonstrated that an optical biopsy needle guided by DRS has sufficient accuracy to differentiate HG from LG carcinoma and benign tissue. It may allow precise targeting of HG prostate cancer providing more accurate assessment of the disease and improvement in patient care.",Cancer;Needles;Optical fibers;Optical fiber sensors;Biomedical optical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591886
Automatic classification of cancer cells in multispectral microscopic images of lymph node samples,"Histopathological analysis is crucial for the diagnosis of a large number of cancer types. A lot of progress has been made in the development of molecular based assays, but many of the cases still require the careful analysis of the stained tissue under a bright-field microscope and its analysis. This procedure is costly and time-consuming. We present a novel method for classification of cancer cells in lymph node images. It is based on the measurement of the spectral image of hematoxylin and eosin stained sample under the microscope and the analysis of the acquired data using state of the art machine learning techniques. The method is based on the analysis of the spectral information of the cells as well as their morphological properties. A large number of descriptors is extracted for each cell location, which are used to train a supervised classifier which discriminates between normal and cancer cells. We show that a reliable analysis can be made with detection rate (recall) of 81%-100% for the cancer class.",Cancer;Microscopy;Biomedical imaging;Lymph nodes;Feature extraction;Training;Histograms,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591597
Image classification of unlabeled malaria parasites in red blood cells,"This paper presents a method to detect unlabeled malaria parasites in red blood cells. The current “gold standard” for malaria diagnosis is microscopic examination of thick blood smear, a time consuming process requiring extensive training. Our goal is to develop an automate process to identify malaria infected red blood cells. Major issues in automated analysis of microscopy images of unstained blood smears include overlapping cells and oddly shaped cells. Our approach creates robust templates to detect infected and uninfected red cells. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOGs) features are extracted from templates and used to train a classifier offline. Next, the ViolaJones object detection framework is applied to detect infected and uninfected red cells and the image background. Results show our approach out-performs classification approaches with PCA features by 50% and cell detection algorithms applying Hough transforms by 24%. Majority of related work are designed to automatically detect stained parasites in blood smears where the cells are fixed. Although it is more challenging to design algorithms for unstained parasites, our methods will allow analysis of parasite progression in live cells under different drug treatments.",Diseases;Feature extraction;Detectors;Transforms;Red blood cells;Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591599
Detecting cell division of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria from bright-field microscopy images with hidden conditional random fields,"An approach to automatically detect bacteria division with temporal models is presented. To understand how bacteria migrate and proliferate to form complex multicellular behaviours such as biofilms, it is desirable to track individual bacteria and detect cell division events. Unlike eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic cells such as bacteria lack distinctive features, causing bacteria division difficult to detect in a single image frame. Furthermore, bacteria may detach, migrate close to other bacteria and may orientate themselves at an angle to the horizontal plane. Our system trains a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) model from tracked and aligned bacteria division sequences. The HCRF model classifies a set of image frames as division or otherwise. The performance of our HCRF model is compared with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The results show that a HCRF classifier outperforms a HMM classifier. From 2D bright field microscopy data, it is a challenge to separate individual bacteria and associate observations to tracks. Automatic detection of sequences with bacteria division will improve tracking accuracy.",Microorganisms;Hidden Markov models;Trajectory;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Level set;Shape,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591600
A study on feature extraction and disease stage classification for Glioma pathology images,"Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are important in obtaining precision medicine and patient driven solutions for various diseases. One of the main brain tumor is the Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and histopathological tissue images can provide unique insights into identifying and grading disease stages. In this work, we consider feature extraction and disease stage classification for brain tumor histopathological images using automatic image analysis methods. In particular we utilized automatic nuclei segmentation and labeling for histopathology image data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and check for classification accuracy using support vector machine (SVM), Random Forests (RF).

Identification of rabbit coccidia by using microscopic images,"Coccidia is an intestinal parasite that infects animals and causes Coccidiosis disease. Substantial animal mortality can be faced within several days of infection if it is not diagnosed or treated at the early stages of infection. Therefore, an urgent diagnostic tool has become necessary to tackle the spread of disease and to avoid animal death and subsequent business losses. Vets detect the disease by examining animal stool slides under microscope. They consider Eimeria oocyst sizes, textures and shapes to identify which genus has infected animals. However, this manual process is generally a challenging task as those oocysts are quite similar to each other and difficult to distinguish them. Apart from the morphological characteristics, this paper applies an automated, more robust and simple method to identify Coccidia species. It adopts pixel-based features instead of the morphological ones. Grey-scale images of Coccidia microscopic slides have been analyzed and the mean of their pixel values has been calculated to form three different feature sets to characterize the microscopic images. They are (i) column feature set (CF), (ii) row feature set (RF) and (iii) combination of both feature sets (CRF). Automated classification of the microscopic images is then carried out using K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. A five-fold cross validation is adapted to assess the robustness of the method and repeated for 50 times to avoid any statistical bias. As a case study, a database of 2902 microscopic images of Eimeria taken from rabbits has been analyzed, which yields a predictive accuracy of 70.44%, 67.47%and 80.13% for CF, RF and CRF, respectively. Furthermore, the number of features has been reduced by eliminating low degree of the features. This process has reduced the feature size by as much as 30% and improved the best predictive accuracy by about 3% to 82.83%. This promising outcome is expected to lead a fully automated mobile diagnostic tool for parasite detection.",Microscopy;Radio frequency;Rabbits;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Diseases;Coccidia;Eimeria Species;Bioinformatics;Image Processing;Pattern Recognitaion;KNN,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 International Conference on Engineering & MIS (ICEMIS),10.1109/ICEMIS.2016.7745328
Optical tweezers for force measurements and rheological studies on biological samples,"Light allows the observation of the microscopic world but also, by means of optical tweezers, the non-invasive manipulation of micro-objects and the measurement of the forces exerted on them. However, measuring forces inside living cells is still a challenge due the characteristics of the trapped organelles (non-spherical, unknown size and index of refraction) and the cell cytoplasm surrounding them (heterogeneous and dynamic, non-purely viscous). Here, we show how two very recent methods overcome these limitations: on the one hand, forces can be measured in such environment by the direct detection of changes in the light momentum; on the other hand, an active-passive calibration technique provides both the stiffness of the optical trap as well as the local viscoelastic properties of the cell cytoplasm.",Biomedical optical imaging;Force measurement;Optical variables measurement;Charge carrier processes;Calibration;Force;Optical interferometry;optical trapping;cell rheology;micromanipulation;optical force;cell cytoplasm,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 15th Workshop on Information Optics (WIO),10.1109/WIO.2016.7745567
Detection of Calcium-induced morphological changes on RBCs by digital holographic microscopy and blinking optical tweezers,"Ca+2 level in the circulating red blood cells (RBCs) takes part not only in controlling biophysical properties, but also affects the membrane composition, and its morphological and rheological properties. Excessive accumulation of Ca2+ within the cells is associated with a number of important pathological diseases. In this paper, by the use of digital holographic microscopy (DHM), we quantitatively analyzed the volumetric behavior of RBC membrane under influence of excess Calcium ions. DHM in a transmission mode is an effective tool for quantitative visualization of phase objects. By deriving the associated phase changes 3D information on the morphology variation of the cells at arbitrary time scales is obtained. Individual cells are immobilized by the use of optical tweezers and are monitored live with DHM system, while the concentration of Ca2+ ions in the buffer is changed simultaneously.

An automated system for platelet segmentation using histogram-based thresholding,"Platelet count is a crucial diagnostic metric for identifying several diseases. In most of the laboratories, Leishman stained blood slides are used for counting platelets. However, the problem arises when huge numbers of blood samples are to be tested by the laboratory technicians making the entire process time-consuming and prone to human errors. In this paper, we propose an automated system for counting platelets, which eliminates the need of expert lab technicians and reduces the cost and time of the test. We have used histogram based thresholding and morphological operations to extract platelets from the microscopic image of blood cells. After the platelets are extracted, our automated system uses a mechanism analogous to the one that is used in laboratories to count the number of platelets present per microliter of blood for each patient. Through a comparative study of manual platelet count and the platelet count given by this automated system, we found that the automated system present here gives near accurate result and is highly efficient.",Image segmentation;Cells (biology);Microscopy;Films;Image color analysis;White blood cells;Thrombocytopenia;Thrombocytosis;Platelet segmentation;Automated platelet counting;Morphological operation;Histogram based thresholding;Dengue Diagnosis,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, & Automation (ICACCA) (Fall)",10.1109/ICACCAF.2016.7749000
Automated ROI detection for histological image using fuzzy c-means and K-means algorithm,This paper deals with the automatic detection of the region of interest (ROI) in Histopathologoical images by means of advanced segmentation techniques. The clustering techniques like fuzzy C-means (FCM) and K-means algorithms for the color image segmentation are implemented on a dataset which consisted of skin images. Euclidian distance is used as a distance metric in both the algorithms. The resultant segmented regions which were obtained from these two techniques were compared and found to be of similar features. The entire experiment is implemented in the L*a*b* color space and a concise discussion regarding the color space conversion is carried out. This paper presents a detailed discussion on the various steps of the two clustering techniques and its requirements and shows how the result obtained from them could be used for diagnosis purpose by the human experts in medical treatment.,Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Clustering algorithms;Color;Motion segmentation;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Region of interest;K-means;Fuzzy C-Means;L∗a∗b∗ color space;Euclidian distance,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)",10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754869
A hybrid approach to diagnosis of tuberculosis from sputum,"This paper describes a hybrid approach to diagnosis of Tuberculosis from microscopic images of sputum. It is non-invasive in nature. In Sputum microscopy analysis, Ziehl-Neelsen-stained sputum smears are examined using a compound microscope for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB). TB bacteria appear in pinkish violet color and rest of the slide looks bluish, when seen through a compound digital microscope. This manual process is being automated in this work. In microscopic analysis of sputum, white and blue regions are suppressed consecutively to highlight the pink region using RGB color information. After that the pink regions are segmented using a threshold value obtained by iterative method. After segmentation, redundant or false contours are removed. A new approach to detect more accurate contour boundary has been proposed here. In this technique, once the initial contour is selected then a gradient based region growing technique is used locally to find more accurate contour of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. Shape, color and granularity features of the suspected region of the microscopic images of sputum smears are computed for the diagnosis of TB. Using each of these features, a fuzzy decision about the presence of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis is generated. All these three individual decisions are combined to produce the final decision. This approach is characterized as hybrid as it uses both crisp and fuzzy data representation. This approach reduces the false positive and false negative rate and the sensitivity and Specificity of the system are 93.9% and 88.2% respectively, which are quite high.",Microscopy;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Compounds;Skin;X-rays;Indexes;Dilation;Erosion;Fuzzy system;Gradient operator;Sputum microscopy;Ziehl-Neelsen stain,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, and Optimization Techniques (ICEEOT)",10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7754790
Morphological observation of self-aggregation of β-amyloid 1−40,"Amyloid peptide beta (Aβ), as the main component of the amyloid plaques present in the patient brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a group of peptides with typical number of amino acid residuals from 39 to 43. Aβ1-40 is the most dominant type in all Aβ variants and possesses the most closely correlation with late-onset AD. Synthetic Aβ1-40 from monomer to fibril in vitro shares many features with the amyloid in plaques. In this study, the aggregations of Aβ1-40 in different solutions were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Morphological changes of Aβ1-40 from oligomers to fibrils in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) were observed in detail. Peak Force QNM mode was applied in the AFM scanning to minimize the strong force applied between the probe and protein samples, and the scanning mode also avoided damaging the Aβ1-40 aggregated forms. Study of Aβ1-40 aggregation in different mediums will help choose a desirable solution with minimal impact on cell viability for the further cytotoxicity study.",Peptides;Imaging;Calcium;Diseases;Magnesium;Temperature measurement;Bars,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO),10.1109/NANO.2016.7751415
Imaging of nanoscale particles in microfluidic devices using super-lens manipulated by optically-induced dielectrophoresis,"Microsphere-assisted microscopy is a recent super-resolution microscopy technique that is a simple but effective approach to resolve features two to four times smaller than the diffraction limit. However, it is still a difficulty to place high-refractive-index microspheres-based super-lens at a specific site of interest, especially inside microfluidic devices. Here, we demonstrate a flexible and cantilever-free method for transporting a microsphere super-lens to a specific site of interest inside a confined microfluidic environment using optically-induced dielectrophoresis. By such method, nanoparticles and subwavelength features of interest can be observed in real-time and large field-of-view super-resolution images can be obtained inside microfluidic devices.",Microscopy;Optical imaging;Optical refraction;Optical microscopy;Spatial resolution,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO),10.1109/NANO.2016.7751531
Completely evolution of Gouy phase shift in longitudinal terahertz wave,"We experimentally and theoretically investigate the Gouy phase shift of the longitudinal terahertz (THz) wave in the entire focal region. By comparing the pulses shape and orientation before and after the focus, we find that the complete Gouy shift for the longitudinal field components is same to that of the transverse field components, with the value of π.

Cleavage-stage embryo rotation tracking and automated micropipette control: Towards automated single cell manipulation,"Micromanipulation of individual biological cells, such as embryos during preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is a delicate and time-consuming task. Two major procedures in PGD include the rotation of the embryo to gain a more favorable position for zona breaching, and the extraction of a blastomere after an opening has been made in the zona pellucida. Rotation tracking of cleavage-stage embryos has not been reported given their lack of distinctive features. In this manuscript, a geometric model for partially determining the three dimensional (3-D) angular position of 2-cell embryos using two dimensional (2-D) microscopic brightfield images was derived and verified using a computer generated model. This model was then applied using computer vision algorithms on a rotating cleavage-stage mouse embryo, demonstrating partial 3-D rotation tracking. Furthermore, embryo micromanipulation tasks are typically performed manually using micropipettes. Technological advances have made automation of these tasks possible. This manuscript also presents computer vision algorithms for the segmentation and calibration of micropipettes. The calibration procedure allowed automated position control of the micropipettes without the need for real-time vision feedback using micropipette recognition algorithms, and effective position control was verified using semi-automated blastomere extraction experiments.

White blood cells nucleus segmentation from microscopic images of strained peripheral blood film during leukemia and normal condition,"Counting of White blood cells (WBC) & characterizing their nucleus can provide valuable information to the doctors in order to identify different diseases or stage of a particular disease. The manual method is a tiresome process and has a lot of inaccuracy. On the other hand, the machine (hematological analyzer) based method are very expensive. Digital image processing can be a less time consuming and cost effective method for counting and characterizing the WBC. In order to Count or characterize WBC by image processing, proper segmentation is the key challenge. In this paper we proposed an algorithm to segment WBC nucleus from microscopic images of stained peripheral blood film during leukemia and normal condition. The proposed algorithm involves different steps such as color space conversion, color thresholding, filtering, marker controlled watershed and different morphological operations. The accuracy of the result obtained is 88.57%.",Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Blood;Image reconstruction;Microscopy;Films;Aerospace electronics;White blood cells (WBC);segmentation;leukemi;morphological operatio;color space,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 5th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision (ICIEV)",10.1109/ICIEV.2016.7760026
Adding large EM stack support,"Serial section electron microscopy (SSEM) image stacks generated using high throughput microscopy techniques are an integral tool for investigating brain connectivity and cell morphology. FIB or 3View scanning electron microscopes easily generate gigabytes of data. In order to produce analyzable 3D dataset from the imaged volumes, efficient and reliable image segmentation is crucial. Classical manual approaches to segmentation are time consuming and labour intensive. Semiautomatic seeded watershed segmentation algorithms, such as those implemented by ilastik image processing software, are a very powerful alternative, substantially speeding up segmentation times. We have used ilastik effectively for small EM stacks - on a laptop, no less; however, ilastik was unable to carve the large EM stacks we needed to segment because its memory requirements grew too large - even for the biggest workstations we had available. For this reason, we refactored the carving module of ilastik to scale it up to large EM stacks on large workstations, and tested its efficiency. We modified the carving module, building on existing blockwise processing functionality to process data in manageable chunks that can fit within RAM (main memory). We review this refactoring work, highlighting the software architecture, design choices, modifications, and issues encountered.",Image segmentation;Microprocessors;Memory management;Random access memory;Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering algorithms;image analysis;segmentation;blockwise carving;large data;code refactoring,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 4th Saudi International Conference on Information Technology (Big Data Analysis) (KACSTIT),10.1109/KACSTIT.2016.7756066
Texture analysis of 2D spatial distribution of blood pharmacokinetic model parameters for endometrial carcinoma classification,"This paper describes a pilot study aimed at evaluating the usefulness of texture parameters computed from blood pharmacokinetic maps as biomarkers of cancers. The maps are extracted from DCE MRI images which, in turn, visualize blood perfusion in tissue by means of a contrast medium. Each voxel of a DCE image is characterised by a curve in time domain (enhancement signal). The shape of such curves is characteristic to different tissues and is quantified by fitting a proposed parameterized signal model. Different-modality MR images were acquired for a small number of patients, prior to diagnosed cancer surgical extraction. Six images were collected for each patient, four of them were distributions of blood pharmacokinetic model parameters and two - ADC and VIBE MR images. The extracted carcinoma tissue for each patient was investigated by pathologists. This histological grade provided labels to images for supervised data exploration. Both unsupervised (clustering) and supervised (LDA) experiments demonstrated the image texture can be a promising biomarker to reflect correlations between tumour tissue appearance at structural and functional MRI and the corresponding histological characteristics.",Magnetic resonance imaging;Mathematical model;Tumors;Training;Two dimensional displays;Cancer;blood pharmacokinteic models;texture analysis;endometrial carcinoma,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",10.1109/SPA.2016.7763593
Set of descriptors for skin cancer diagnosis using non-dermoscopic color images,"Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Diagnosis of melanoma in early stages significantly enhances the survival rate. Recently there has been a rising trend in web-based and mobile applications for early detection of melanoma using images captured by conventional cameras. These images usually contain fewer detailed information in comparison with dermoscopic (microscopic) images. Meanwhile, non-dermoscopic images have the advantage of broad availability. In this paper a set of ten features is proposed which cover different color characteristics of melanoma visible in skin images. The first 5 features are extracted using Fuzzy C-means clustering based on color variations and color spatial distributions of pigmented skin. These features are shown to be discriminative for melanoma lesions. The next 5 features consider colors and intensity of the colors. Hence, a 10 dimensional color feature space is formed. Experimental results show that classification accuracy of suspicious moles, by the proposed set of features, outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods.",Decision support systems;Melanoma diagnosis;feature extraction;pigmented skin lesion;medical imaging;classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532837
ICORD: Intelligent Collection of Redundant Data — A Dynamic System for Crowdsourcing Cell Segmentations Accurately and Efficiently,"Segmentation is a fundamental step in analyzing biological structures in microscopy images. When state-of-the-art automated methods are found to produce inaccurate boundaries, interactive segmentation can be effective. Since the inclusion of domain experts is typically expensive and does not scale, crowdsourcing has been considered. Due to concerns about the quality of crowd work, quality control methods that rely on a fixed number of redundant annotations have been used. We here introduce a collection strategy that dynamically assesses the quality of crowd work. We propose ICORD (Intelligent Collection Of Redundant annotation Data), a system that predicts the accuracy of a segmented region from analysis of (1) its geometric and intensity-based features and (2) the crowd worker's behavioral features. Based on this score, ICORD dynamically determines if the annotation accuracy is satisfactory or if a higher-quality annotation should be sought out in another round of crowdsourcing. We tested ICORD on phase contrast and fluorescence images of 270 cells. We compared the performance of ICORD and a popular baseline method for which we aggregated 1,350 crowd-drawn cell segmentations. Our results show that ICORD collects annotations both accurately and efficiently. Accuracy levels are within 3 percentage points of those of the baseline. More importantly, due to its dynamic nature, ICORD vastly outperforms the baseline method with respect to efficiency. ICORD only uses between 27% and 50% of the resources, i.e., collection time and cost, that the baseline method requires.",Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Crowdsourcing;Predictive models;Microscopy;Training data,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW),10.1109/CVPRW.2016.174
Hierarchical classification of HEP-2 cell images using class-specific features,"The paper proposes a class-specific feature assisted automatic classification approach of microscopic HEp-2 cell images. Unlike traditional methods our method highlights two important aspects: (1) the visual characteristics of classes to formulate class-specific image features and (2) the classification task is treated as hierarchical verification sub-tasks. Thus, the overall classification problem is modeled as a verification of each class, using its class-specific features. We have demonstrated that the proposed method yields a high classification rate utilizing simple and efficient features with only (20%) of the data for training. Additionally, we also experimentally analyze the crucial aspects, such as comparison with a traditional non-hierarchical framework and performance evaluation on low contrast images which is useful for early disease detection.",Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Visualization;Solid modeling;Diseases;Indexes;Reliability;Class-specific features;Hierarchical framework;Non-hierarchical framework,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 6th European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP),10.1109/EUVIP.2016.7764585
White Blood Cell Nuclei Segmentation Using Level Set Methods and Geometric Active Contours,"A new method for segmenting white blood cells nuclei in microscopic images is presented. Challenges to accurate segmentation include intra-class variation of the nuclei cell boundaries, non-uniform illumination, and changes in the cell topology due to its orientation and stage of maturity. In this research, level set methods and geometric active contours are used to segment the nucleus of white blood cells from the cytoplasm and the cell wall. Level set methods use morphological operations to estimate an initial cell boundary and are fully automated. Geometric active contours are less computationally complex and adapt better to the curve topology of the cell boundary than parametric active contours, which have been previously used for white blood cell segmentation. Segmentation performance is compared with other segmentation methods using the Berkeley benchmark database and the proposed method is shown to be superior using various indices.",Level set;Image segmentation;Picture archiving and communication systems;Shape;Active contours;Surface morphology;Image edge detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA),10.1109/DICTA.2016.7797097
Automatic Detecting Cornea Fungi Based on Texture Analysis,"Fungal keratitis has a high rate of blindness and can cause big harm to health. In recent years the incidence of it is rising. So the accurate diagnosis of fungal keratitis is important, but traditional diagnostic methods have some deficiencies. This paper proposes a new cornea fungi automatic detection method based on texture analysis and support vector machine (SVM). The detection of hyphae is a typical evidence of the infection of fungal keratitis, so in this method we detect cornea fungi by hyphae. First, we enhance the confocal microscopic images of cornea to separate hyphae and nerve from the background visually. After that, we extract the texture feature based on local binary patterns (LBP). Then we train the SVM classifier using the extracted feature and labels. Finally testing the accuracy of this method, and dyeing hyphae and nerve with different colors to distinguish the images of fungal keratitis from healthy cornea. The accuracy of this method is 93.5294%. Eventually, we make it able to separate images of fungal keratitis from healthy cornea, thus this method can assist doctors to make further diagnosis whether patients are infected with fungal keratitis.",Cornea;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Microscopy;Fungi;Image color analysis;Medical services;fungal keratitis;cornea fungi;texture analysis;SVM,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Cloud (SmartCloud),10.1109/SmartCloud.2016.26
Curvelet-based texture classification of critical Gleason patterns of prostate histological images,"This paper presents our new result of a study on machine-aided classification of four critical Gleason patterns with curvelet-based texture descriptors extracted from prostatic histological section images. The reliable recognition of these patterns between Gleason score 6 and Gleason score 8 is of crucial importance that will affect the appropriate treatment and patient's quality of life. Higher-order statistical moments of fine scale curvelet coefficients are selected as discriminative features. A two-level classifier consisting of two Gaussian kernel support vector machines, each incorporated with a pertinent voting mechanism by multiple windowed patches in an image for final decision making, has been developed.

Automatic recognition of white blood cells using weighted two phase test sample sparse representation,"Microscopic images of blood are very important among the various medical images. One of the most important applications is to diagnosis blood disorders and its types like blood cancer. The main issue to diagnosis blood cancers is white blood globule either mature or not. There are many problem during using image processing to investigate white blood Cell can be mentioned as non-uniformity of colors, different brightness of images, variety of images, different size and texture of images, inherency of white cells in bone marrow images and adjoining of white cells to other blood parts like red blood cell. This paper used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to obtain perpendicular bases that results in segmentation of blood cell kernels. To extract the Cytoplasm borders around the kernel, Variational Level Set Formulation of Active Contours Without Re-initialization method has been used. The main contribution of this paper is that after segmentation, the LBP has been extracted by converting colors in a new space YCBCR on the color factors of each channel so as to extract features.

A Hybrid Feature Selection With Ensemble Classification for Imbalanced Healthcare Data: A Case Study for Brain Tumor Diagnosis,"Electronic health records (EHRs) are providing increased access to healthcare data that can be made available for advanced data analysis. This can be used by the healthcare professionals to make a more informed decision providing improved quality of care. However, due to the inherent heterogeneous and imbalanced characteristics of medical data from EHRs, data analysis task faces a big challenge. In this paper, we address the challenges of imbalanced medical data about a brain tumor diagnosis problem. Morphometric analysis of histopathological images is rapidly emerging as a valuable diagnostic tool for neuropathology. Oligodendroglioma is one type of brain tumor that has a good response to treatment provided the tumor subtype is recognized accurately. The genetic variant, 1p-/19q-, has recently been found to have high chemosensitivity, and has morphological attributes that may lend it to automated image analysis and histological processing and diagnosis. This paper aims to achieve a fast, affordable, and objective diagnosis of this genetic variant of oligodendroglioma with a novel data mining approach combining a feature selection and ensemble-based classification. In this paper, 63 instances of brain tumor with oligodendroglioma are obtained due to prevalence and incidence of the tumor variant. In order to minimize the effect of an imbalanced healthcare data set, a global optimization-based hybrid wrapper-filter feature selection with ensemble classification is applied. The experiment results show that the proposed approach outperforms the standard techniques used in brain tumor classification problem to overcome the imbalanced characteristics of medical data.",Tumors;Feature extraction;Data mining;Medical diagnostic imaging;Artificial neural networks;Brain tumor;morphological features;ANNIGMA;MRMR;feature selection;classification,ARTICLE,2016,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2647238

But on the other hand, it is the main risk for human health, archives, food logistics and millions of euros lost per annum just due to different kinds of fungus. The main aim of this research is to develop an automated system for the detection of fungus spores in air. We have developed a novel system for fungus detection through an optical sensor system. First of all, our system will collect air samples. Then, the handling system moved them under a microscopic camera and get images of the sample. Since images have noise regions and the spore boundaries were unclear, pre-processing techniques have been applied and different filters have been used. Then, the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features were extracted and the feature vector was formed.

Image processing based leukemia cancer cell detection,"Microscopic pictures are reviewed visually by hematologists and the procedure is tedious and time taking which causes late detection. Therefore automatic image handling framework is required that can overcome related limitations in visual investigation which provide early detection of disease and also type of cancer. The proposed strategy is effectively connected to many numbers of pictures, demonstrating accurate results for changing image standard. Distinctive picture handling calculations, for example, Image enhancement, Clustering, Mathematical process and Labeling are executed utilizing MATLAB. Utilizing a portion of the productive image handling instruments we can recognize and section disease cell. The segmentation helps in knowing the precise size and shape of the cancer cell and the area. First we have utilized image enhancement strategies to improve the quality in terms of contrast and standardize the pixel values in the picture. After enhancement, segmentation is done to concentrate on area of interest; in this case it is nucleus. K-mean segmentation is used for segmentation. At that point we apply Feature extraction after that we have connected it to classifier to get the desired results as whether the cell is cancerous or not.

"Practical approach for disease similarity calculation based on disease phenotype, etiology, and locational clues in disease names","Disease similarity is a useful measure to improve clinical decision support systems wherein it allows continuous presentation of similar diseases. In a previous study, we demonstrated that etiological and symptomatic information of diseases provide a reasonable approximation for the similarity of diseases. This study extends the previously proposed approach by incorporating the locational information of diseases, which may improve the performance against the baseline achieved only by the etiological and symptomatic features.First, this study attempted to acquire anatomical information from disease names in Japanese and evaluated the relation between those disease names by constructing a graph that represents the relations of anatomical concepts. Then, locational information was used as a supplemental input to the disease similarity calculation in the machine learning framework developed for the previous study. The baseline performance of the algorithm presented in the previous study was 0.907 using the normalized disease similarity measure (NDSM) which utilizes 80 annotated diseases as the gold standard. The proposed approach with the locational feature achieved a higher score: 0.921. As expected, in-depth microscopic analysis revealed that this approach benefits the diseases that have tight association with specific locations in the human body. The results suggest that location is a promising feature for computing disease similarity, which is worth further investigation by acquiring locational knowledge from disease profiles.",Optical character recognition software;Diseases;Disease similarity;Disease knowledge base;Disease ontology;ICD-10,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822659
Self-adjusting nuclei segmentation (SANS) of Hematoxylin-Eosin stained histopathological breast cancer images,"Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained breast cancer (BC) histopathological images are widely used in breast cancer diagnosis, for which segmenting the cells/nuclei from the images is a major operation. However, most of current methods are sensitive to the characteristics of the images. In this paper, we propose a self-adjusting method for adaptive cell/nuclei segmentation from HE BC images, which works on BC images of different types and quality. To deal with the diversity of nuclei sizes, our approach employs an ellipse detector to estimate nuclei size, which is essential for noise elimination and for addressing the cell overlap issue. Then we propose a novel seed detection method based on the topological skeleton model in the marker-controlled watershed transform framework.

Detection of malaria parasite species and life cycle stages using microscopic images of thin blood smear,"Malaria is responsible for nearly 438,000 deaths worldwide in a year. A total of 214 million cases of malaria are encountered annually. The conventional method for testing malaria is through microscopy. A blood sample of the patient is spread over a glass slide, stained with Giemsa stain and examined under a microscope. It takes a few hours and a highly trained professional to visually examine the slide and give the results. It is even more difficult to detect the different types of malaria parasite and their stages by the conventional methods. The proposed method involves acquisition of the thin blood smear microscopic image at 100x magnification, pre-processing by partial contrast stretching, separation of infected cell from the image by applying k-means clustering on the a*b component of L*a*b color space, feature extraction (shape and textural) of the infected cell, feature reduction using one way ANOVA and finally training the K-nearest neighbor classifier to test the images. Instead of extracting features for the entire group of erythrocytes present in the image, the algorithm only processes the infected cells increasing the speed, effectiveness and efficiency of testing. The KNN classifier is trained with 300 images to detect three lifecycle stages (trophozite, schizont and gametocyte) for each of the four species of malarial parasites (P.falciparum, P.vivax, P.malariae, and P.ovale) with an accuracy of 90.17% and sensitivity of 90.23%.",Diseases;Image segmentation;Blood;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Image color analysis;Analysis of variance;Malaria;K-means clustering;one-way ANOVA;classification;K-nearest neighbor classifier,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT),10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823258
Unsupervised Leukemia Cells Segmentation Based on Multi-space Color Channels,"Leukemia is a type of cancer that originates in the bone marrow and is characterized by abnormal proliferation of white blood cells. In order to have correct identification of lymphoblasts, hematologists examine blood blades of the patient. A low cost and efficient solution to facilitate the work of these experts is the use of systems to examine blood microscopic images. Segmentation is considered a crucial step to developing these systems. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation technique that uses two-color systems and the clustering algorithm K-means.

Morphological characterization of nailfold capillaries,"Evaluation of nailfold capillaries is extensively used in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis (SSc) spectrum diseases. Studies and scientific research on the characteristic of the capillaries in humans as the basis for assessing the human health is still limited. This study was an effort to characterize the nailfold capillaries morphology. Capillaries were extracted from Nailfold Capillaroscopy, a digital microscopy technique that visualize capillaries under the nailfold. Morphological parameters included arteriolar and venular limb diameter, terminal loop diameter, terminal loop width, capillary height, tortuosity and capillary density. In this study, morphological parameters of normal and hypertensive subjects was compared. Results showed that there were significant differences in arteriolar and venular limb diameter, terminal loop width, capillary height, and tortuosity between normal and hypertensive subjects.",Diseases;Parameter extraction;Hypertension;Shape;Morphology;Visualization;Skin;Nailfold Capillaroscopy;capillaries;characterization;parameter extraction;hypertensive,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA),10.1109/ISITIA.2016.7828644
Detection of sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia causing abnormalities in thin smear of human blood sample using image processing,"About 3.2 million people suffer from sickle-cell disease. Aim of this paper is to detect sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia. The proposed method involves acquisition of the thin blood smear microscopic images, pre-processing by applying median filter, segmentation of overlapping erythrocytes using marker-controlled watershed segmentation, applying morphological operations to enhance the image, extraction of features such as metric value, aspect ratio, radial signature and its variance, and finally training the K-nearest neighbor classifier to test the images. The algorithm processes the infected cells increasing the speed, effectiveness and efficiency of training and testing.

In Search of the Optimal Set of Indicators when Classifying Histopathological Images,"There is currently a large amount of histopathological images due to the intensive prevention screening programs worldwide. This fact overloads the pathologists' tasks. Hence, there is a connected high need for a quantitative image-based evaluation of digital pathology slides. The current work extracts 76 numerical features from 357 histopathological images and focuses on the selection of the most valuable features that conducts to a smaller data set on which a SVM classifier achieves a better prediction.

Optimization of overlapping dendritic cell segmentation in phase contrast microscopy images,"The segmentation of Dendritic Cell (DC) from clumps of overlapping Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) in Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM) images is notoriously challenging for an automated image analysis system. This problem is encountered due to the presence of shade off effect and halo region in the image. In order to improve the performance of DC classification, the methods in pre-processing are enhanced and analysed. The images undergo image normalization process to remove uneven illumination. Initially, Local Contrast Threshold (LCT) has been applied in preprocessing. However, it results in low performance of DC segmentation and identification. Therefore, a hybrid of low and high sigma in Gaussian kernel filtering with Local Adaptive Threshold (H-GLAT) through logical operator AND are proposed. Following that, halo removal is applied to eliminate halo region and post-processed by morphological operators to discriminate the cells from the background. The quantitative assessment demonstrates that proposed framework can successfully address these imaging artifact issues. The test results show that the H-GLAT method is better than the LCT that applied in previous work with classifier performance of 76%, 93.3% and 99.5% precision, recall and accuracy respectively.",Image segmentation;Phase change materials;Kernel;Microscopy;Filtering;Gray-scale;Dendritic cell;image processing;overlapping;halo region;phase contrast microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 IEEE EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences (IECBES),10.1109/IECBES.2016.7843451

The system can be used for the classification of plants when a large number of new plant species are discovered and it can be applied in plant disease detection project. A digital microscope is used for gathering the cross sectional images. Here, the proposed system mainly consists of three sections. The first section is image gathering and pre-processing and the next section is the feature extraction by spatial methods. The texture features are extracted using GLCM method in this project.

Enhanced leucocyte classification for leukaemia detection,"The measure of blood cells are more important for the doctor to diagnose various diseases such as anaemia, leukaemia etc. Similarly observation and classification of these cells grant for the estimation and detecting of a vast number of sickness. By evaluating white blood cells (WBCs) allows the leukaemia detection (Acute Lympho blastic leukaemia (ALL), Acute Myloid leukaemia),be cancer which affected on blood which can be lethal if it can be untreated. So precise counting and classification of blood cells have an important role. More over the counts especially differential counts and shape provide a lot of valuable information to evaluate leukaemia. In current methods the morphological evaluation of haemocytes is performed manually by experts and counting of blood cells is done using a device called Haemocytometer. Yet, this approach has so many limitations, such as slow estimation, different standard, deviant accuracy and dependence on the operator's skill. For counting hardware solutions such as the Automated Haematology Counter exists, they are very expensive, unaffordable in every hospital laboratory and also use actual blood samples. So there consistently need a cost effective, simple and robust method for counting,analysis and classification of blood cells.

Automated classification for pathological prostate images using AdaBoost-based Ensemble Learning,"We present an AdaBoost-based Ensemble Learning for supporting automated Gleason grading of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRCA). The method is able to differentiate Gleason patterns 4-5 from patterns 1-3 as the patterns 4-5 are correlated to more aggressive disease while patterns 1-3 tend to reflect more favorable patient outcome. This method is based on various feature descriptors and classifiers for multiple color channels, including color channels of red, green and blue, as well as the optical intensity of hematoxylin and eosin stainings. The AdaBoost-based Ensemble Learning method integrates the color channels, feature descriptors and classifiers, and finally constructs a strong classifier.

Improved approach towards classification of histopathology images using bag-of-features,"The paper addresses the problem of detecting malignancy in histopathological sample of breast tissue. The proposed method uses bag-of-features approach along with color normalization. The proposed method uses color normalization as pre-processing step prior to feature extraction. SIFT/DCT is used for feature extraction. The images are described using SIFT/DCT descriptor each of 128/192 dimension. Further these image descriptors are quantized using bag-of-feature into predefined codebook of sizes 150 and 500. In classification, image is classified using multi-class SVM classifier which groups image into suitable class namely normal, in-situ, and invasive. The proposed method reports classification accuracy as 100% for ductal carcinoma in situ, 98.88% for invasive carcinoma, and 100% for normal class images.

A classification method of epithelial cells and clue cells based on multi-scale texture analysis,"A novel method is proposed for the classification of epithelial cells and clue cells in wet mount microscopic images of vaginal secretions. Generally, there are many complicated ingredients in these images, and different from the gram stain method, no color information can be used. Obviously, the texture information of these cells becomes the main feature in the classification of these ingredients. After careful observation of difference of these two kinds of cells, we found the surface of clue cells is rougher. So, we extract texture features of those cells using the multi-scale texture energy descriptor which can reflect the difference of these two kinds of cells in different scales effectively. After that, the traditional SVM classifier is employed for the classification. The experimental results show that our method can effectively complete the classification task.",Feature extraction;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface texture;Microscopy;Support vector machines;Algorithm design and analysis;Multi-scale;Texture energy;Clue cell;Vaginal secretions,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)",10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852750
Ensemble Sparse Classification of Colon Cancer,"Automated colon cancer detection helps get rid of the slow and laborious process of manual examination of histopathological tissue specimens using microscope, and provides a reliable second opinion to the histopathologists. Therefore, automated colon cancer detection has been the focus of research community in the past two decades, and researchers have proposed various automatic colon cancer detection systems. Most of the existing colon cancer detection systems extract features and then construct single classifier to perform classification. However, the small sample size problem and especially the noise in neuroimaging data makes it challenging to achieve good classification results by training only one global classifier. In this work, we propose a local patch based ensemble method instead of building a single global classifier. The proposed method builds multiple individual weak classifiers based on the different subsets of local patches, and then combines the output of weak classifiers for more accurate and robust classification. In particular, Haralick and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) features are extracted from pre-processed colon biopsy images, and images are partitioned into smaller fixed size patches. Features of the random subsets of patches are combined to train weak classifier. Several kernels of SVM such as linear, RBF and sigmoid are used as weak classifiers. Later, the output of various weak classifiers is combined to get the final classification results. The proposed subspace ensemble classification method yields better results compared to one global classifier in all the three cases (linear, RBF, sigmoid) in terms of various performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, Matthew's correlation coefficient, and Area Under the Curve (AUC), however, classification performance is slightly better for ensemble of RBF kernel. The proposed method has also yielded better performance compared to existing techniques on a colon cancer dataset of 174 subjects.",Colon;Cancer;Feature extraction;Biopsy;Support vector machines;Cancer detection;Kernel;Haralick features;Local binary patterns;Colon cancer detection;SVM classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology (FIT),10.1109/FIT.2016.050

However, this task is prone to errors and time consuming. An automatic detection and classification of WBC images can enhance the accuracy and speed up the detection of WBCs. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for localization of WBCs within microscopic blood smear images using a multi-class ensemble classification mechanism. In the proposed framework, the nuclei are first segmented, followed by extraction of features such as texture, statistical, and wavelet features. Finally, the detected WBCs are classified into five classes including basophil, eosinophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte.

An analytical approach for leukemia diagnosis from light microscopic images of Rbcs (Computational approach for leukemia diagnosis),"Leukemia is routinely diagnosed by light microscopic images. However, pathologists' criteria for a disease diagnosis from images are mostly qualitative and empirical in nature. Reports suggest that though leukemia is a cancer of leukocytes; however, there are morphological alterations of red blood cells (RBCs) under the condition of leukemia. This has been evident by in observation of ultra-structural images of RBCs. Recently computational analysis of those ultra-structural images helps in revealing the quantitative understanding of the changes under the condition of leukemia. Light microscopic image analysis may further propel this approach towards clinical feasibility. Hence, development of computational analytical method for light microscopic images would the most suited way for direct application in clinics as the dragged quantitative information may help in an understanding of grading of the disease.

A comparison of plasmodium falciparum identification from digitalization microscopic thick blood film,"Malaria is a serious public health problem in Indonesia. Conventional methods of identification malaria parasite are generally carried out by paramedics when they are thoroughly examine blood performed using a microscope. This way is currently used anywhere, because it is cheap and it has good accuracy than others. However, this conventional methods can make a difference if the diagnosis is made by different experts. The detection of malaria parasite is time consuming and subjective factors are very high. Therefore, required the appropriate method to identify malaria parasite with a high accuracy. This research aims to compare the level of accuracy among several methods that are used to classify plasmodium falciparum. The comparing methods are KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), backpropagation, and LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization). This research has three main stages, they are preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The preprocessing aims to get ROI (Region of Interest) by cropping manually and resizing images. The feature extraction method uses Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to get texture feature values such as contrasts, correlations, energys, and homogeneity that appearance in digitalization microscopic thick blood film.

A comparative evaluation of segmentation methods for dendritic cells identification from microscopic images,"Public health is one of the major concerns at the world level. Toxicology is an extremely challenging issue regarding that toxic substances are harmful to human health. In fact, toxicology studies are indispensable to evaluate the toxic effects on humans. Currently, a new evaluation technique based on the analysis of dendritic cells in vitro has been found by researchers. This analysis that remains purely visual is a tedious process, subjective and time-consuming. Therefore, an assessment tool for the analysis of toxic impact using automatic processing techniques by image analysis can be greatly useful for expert biologists. The foremost aim of this paper is to propose two segmentation approaches of dendritic cells from microscopic images and to present a comparative evaluation of them. The first suggested algorithm is based on automatic thresholding and mathematical morphology, while the second one combines the k-means clustering, thresholding and mathematical morphology based operations. For validation purposes, four performance measures were used to assess the obtained segmentation results with the ground truth images, elaborated by expert. Quantitatively, results show that the two suggested algorithms are efficient in identifying dendritic cells from 26 gray-scale images with a segmentation accuracy of 99.00 % and 99.37%, respectively.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Clustering algorithms;Immune system;Conferences;Morphology;dendritic cells;segmentation;thresholding;mathematical morphology;k-means clustering,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 International Image Processing, Applications and Systems (IPAS)",10.1109/IPAS.2016.7880129

Enhancement of low quality thick blood smear microscopic images of malaria patients using contrast and edge corrections,"Malaria becomes one of the diseases that cause many deaths in Indonesia, particularly in Eastern Indonesia. Parasite readings in many fields of thick blood smear microscopic images become the gold standard for the diagnosis of malaria. Therefore, it requires high-quality smear image that easily readable existence of parasites. Lack of health infrastructure, especially microscopy specifications, in endemic areas affect the availability of such smear images. Images that produced under these conditions have low quality that have characteristics: blurred, the diminished true color of object, unclear boundary, and the low contrast between the object and the background. Therefore, in this study, we propose image enhancement technique to improve the readability of parasite in the low quality of thick blood smear image. The proposed method consists of two parts, namely contrast and edge corrections. Contrast correction utilizing the integration of contrast correction globally and locally respectively using Dark Stretching and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Meanwhile, edge correction utilizing Unsharp Masking Filtering (UMF) to improve the edge of objects in an image. The results show that the proposed method is better in the image entropy than other methods. While the value of MSE and PSNR better if range of the histogram image is short. This value means that the proposed method can produce images that contain more information than the other methods and have a good effectiveness.

Evaluation of feature descriptors for cancerous tissue recognition,"Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has witnessed a rapid growth over the past decade, providing a variety of automated tools for the analysis of medical images. In surgical pathology, such tools enhance the diagnosing capabilities of pathologists by allowing them to review and diagnose a larger number of cases daily. Geared towards developing such tools, the main goal of this paper is to identify useful computer vision based feature descriptors for recognizing cancerous tissues in histopathologic images. To this end, we use images of Hematoxylin & Eosin-stained microscopic sections of breast and prostate carcinomas, and myometrial leiomyosarcomas, and provide an exhaustive evaluation of several state of the art feature representations for this task. Among the various image descriptors that we chose to compare, including representations based on convolutional neural networks, Fisher vectors, and sparse codes, we found that working with covariance based descriptors shows superior performance on all three types of cancer considered. While covariance descriptors are known to be effective for texture recognition, it is the first time that they are demonstrated to be useful for the proposed task and evaluated against deep learning models. Capitalizing on Region Covariance Descriptors (RCDs), we derive a powerful image descriptor for cancerous tissue recognition termed, Covariance Kernel Descriptor (CKD), which consistently outperformed all the considered image representations.

Automatic detection of laser-induced structures in live cell fluorescent microscopy images using snakes with geometric constraints,"The existence of reliable evaluation datasets for cell image registration algorithms is crucial for quantitative comparison of registration approaches. A new technique for creating real live cell image sequences for this purpose was introduced recently. These datasets contain stable structures bleached by argon laser in the cell nucleus. In this work, we propose an approach for automatic detection of laser-induced linear structures in live cell fluorescent microscopy images. Compared to a previous linear laser-induced structure detection approach, our method employs an active contours model with a Hessian-based image energy term for linear structures enhancement and geometric energy term controlling the geometric relations between the structures. It uses position adaptive tension parameter values to adjust the snakes behavior in problematic regions (end points and intersection points) and a temporal consistent scheme where the results from the previous frame are used as an initial approximation for the current frame.

(3) Adopting a layering approach prior to performing feature extraction. The combination of these aspects gives excellent results. We evaluated our method using 1,063 light-microscopy images of pollen grains from 30 species.

Exploring nanobiotechnology in controlling malaria and cancer,"Plants play an important role in balancing the nature. Green plants synthesize their own food giving off oxygen. Not only plants are the source of food, plant products provide wood and wood products, fibers, drugs, oils, latex, pigments, and resins. In present scenario the bio-compounds like flavinoids, terpenoids, reducing sugars etc present in plants are used in the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Silver nanoparticles play a vital role in drug delivery, diagnostics, imaging, sensing, gene delivery, artificial implants, and tissue engineering. AgNPs are also manufactured using chemical and physical processes, but these methods are costly and have negative impact on environment. Biologically synthesized AgNPs are eco-friendly, cost-effective and do not cause any anthropogenic effects. In the present study we biofabricated AgNPs using leaf extract of certain plants like Azadirachta indica, Callistemon citrinus, and lemongrass. The synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed by using spectral scan within the range of 300-700nm. Particle size and morphology of the AgNPs were studied with the help of Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The so formed particles were spherical in shape ranging from 40-50nm in case of Azadirachta indica, 80-90nm when made through Callistemon citrinus and 20-30nm in lemongrass respectively. These AgNPs were tested against malarial vector Anopheles stephensi and cancer cell lines HepG2.

We use the segmented lymphocyte to extracted gray intensity features for building a classifier. The proposed method takes microscopic image as input data for processing and outputs diagnosis results saying that the patient's blood image was saint or has leukemia.

"An image generator platform to improve cell tracking algorithms: Simulation of objects of various morphologies, kinetics and clustering","Several major advances in Cell and Molecular Biology have been made possible by recent advances in live-cell microscopy imaging. To support these efforts, automated image analysis methods such as cell segmentation and tracking during a time-series analysis are needed. To this aim, one important step is the validation of such image processing methods. Ideally, the “ground truth” should be known, which is possible only by manually labelling images or in artificially produced images. To simulate artificial images, we have developed a platform for simulating biologically inspired objects, which generates bodies with various morphologies and kinetics and, that can aggregate to form clusters. Using this platform, we tested and compared four tracking algorithms: Simple Nearest-Neighbour (NN), NN with Morphology and two DBSCAN-based methods. We show that Simple NN works well for small object velocities, while the others perform better on higher velocities and when clustering occurs. Our new platform for generating new benchmark images to test image analysis algorithms is openly available at (http://griduni.uninova.pt/Clustergen/ClusterGen_vl.0.zip).",Tools;Biological system modeling;Microscopy;Shape;Tracking;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Synthetic Time-lapse Image Simulation;Cell Tracking;Cluster Tracking,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 6th International Conference on Simulation and Modeling Methodologies, Technologies and Applications (SIMULTECH)",
Automated Quantitative Image Analysis of Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining Slides in Lymphoma Based on Hierarchical Kmeans Clustering,"The microscopic image of tissue section stained by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) is an essential part in histopathology researches. Automated HE image processing remains challenging because forms and distributions of cells and other tissue structures are always extremely irregular with no clear boundaries, especially in conducting high throughput analysis which demands higher accuracy and efficient quantification for the reference of pathologists. To solve this problem, we proposed an automated quantitative image analysis pipeline based on hierarchical clustering of local correlations, which segmented the image into nuclei, cytoplasm and extracellular spaces by classifying image pixels on the basis of local correlation features. Segmentation for precise nucleus boundaries was then performed, and finally a set of indicators characterizing tissue structures were extracted to complete quantification of HE images. Experimental results showed high accuracy and adaptability in cell segmentation despite data variance. Quantitative indicators obtained in this essay provide a reliable evidence for the analysis of HE staining lymphoma pathological image.",Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Pathology;Feature extraction;High definition video;Correlation;Microscopy;hematoxylin-eosin staining;image segmentation;tumor microstructure;lymphoma;kmeans clustering,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,2016 8th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education (ITME),10.1109/ITME.2016.0031

By utilizing multi-scale vessel-specific features tuned to capture curvilinear structures such as Frobenius norm of the Hessian eigenvalues, Laplacian of Gaussians (LoG), oriented second derivative, line detector and intensity masked with LoG scale map. we obtain better segmentation results in challenging imaging conditions.

Quantitative estimation of tumor cellularity based on histology data,"Tumor cellularity, the number of cells in the tumor, is an important tissue microstructural feature, which is useful for cancer diagnosis and cell number related treatment. Histopathological examination of tissues reveals the tissue microstructure hence permits to investigate cellularity, but is usually available only as a small sample or after resection. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is a non-invasive imaging technique in cancer diagnosis and treatment, which is supposed to provide an indirect measure of tumor cellularity. How to quantitatively estimate the tumor cell density is still challenging. In this work, we introduce an automated cell nuclei segmentation algorithm for 2D cell density estimation and a model-based method for 3D cell density estimation from tumor histology data, which is an important component in concluding 3D cellularity from 2D histological sections as those usually analyzed in routine histology. The algorithm is part of a novel approach for the estimation of tumor cellularity from histology, as demonstrated by quantitatively analyzing representative tumor samples to study the tumor cellularity. These results might be of importance for the personalized adjustment of therapies and can be applied to many different solid tumors.",Tumors;Cancer;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Estimation;Image segmentation;Lungs,INPROCEEDINGS,2016,"2016 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, Medical Imaging Conference and Room-Temperature Semiconductor Detector Workshop (NSS/MIC/RTSD)",10.1109/NSSMIC.2016.8069630
Determining Shapes and Sizes Using TEM Images: Functionalized Nanoparticles,"Functionalized nanoparticles to be used for drug delivery must undergo specific verifications in accordance to preestablished requirements. Acquiring TEM (transmission electron microscopy) imaging dealing with nanoparticles functionalization, it is possible to encounter possible faults in the shape of the nanoparticles due to surplus of materials or loss in doses of the materials. Even if the functionalizing instrumentation is equipped with dedicated systems acting accordingly, a further “check and balance” process could be useful using for instance imaging.

A Two-Phase Improved Correlation Method for Automatic Particle Selection in Cryo-EM,"Particle selection from cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) images is very important for high-resolution reconstruction of macromolecular structure. The methods of particle selection can be roughly grouped into two classes, template-matching methods and feature-based methods. In general, template-matching methods usually generate better results than feature-based methods. However, the accuracy of template-matching methods is restricted by the noise and low contrast of Cryo-EM images. Moreover, the processing speed of template-matching methods, restricted by the random orientation of particles, further limits their practical applications. In this paper, combining the advantages of feature-based methods and template-matching methods, we present a two-phase improved correlation method for automatic, fast particle selection. In Phase I, we generate a preliminary particle set using rotation-invariant features of particles. In Phase II, we filter the preliminary particle set using a correlation method to reduce the interference of the high noise background and improve the precision of particle selection. We apply several optimization strategies, including a modified adaboost algorithm, Divide and Conquer technique, cascade strategy and graphics processing unit parallel technique, to improve feature recognition ability and reduce processing time. In addition, we developed two correlation score functions for different correlation situations. Experimental results on the benchmark of Cryo-EM images show that our method can improve the accuracy and processing speed of particle selection significantly.",Correlation;Feature extraction;Training;Accuracy;Three-dimensional displays;IEEE transactions;Computational biology;Particle selection;feature-based;template-matching;rotation-invariant feature;correlation score functions,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2015.2415787
Boundary-to-Marker Evidence-Controlled Segmentation and MDL-Based Contour Inference for Overlapping Nuclei,"This paper presents a novel method for automated morphology delineation and analysis of cell nuclei in histopathology images. Combining the initial segmentation information and concavity measurement, the proposed method first segments clusters of nuclei into individual pieces, avoiding segmentation errors introduced by the scale-constrained Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering. After that a nuclear boundary-to-marker evidence computing is introduced to delineate individual objects after the refined segmentation process. The obtained evidence set is then modeled by the periodic B-splines with the minimum description length principle, which achieves a practical compromise between the complexity of the nuclear structure and its coverage of the fluorescence signal to avoid the underfitting and overfitting results. The algorithm is computationally efficient and has been tested on the synthetic database as well as 45 real histopathology images. By comparing the proposed method with several state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show the superior recognition performance of our method and indicate the potential applications of analyzing the intrinsic features of nuclei morphology.",Image segmentation;Morphology;Clustering algorithms;Active contours;Splines (mathematics);Algorithm design and analysis;Shape;Concavity measurement;minimum description length (MDL);morphology delineation and analysis;nuclear-boundary-to-marker evidence set;periodic B-splines,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2015.2504422
Visually Meaningful Histopathological Features for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer,"Histopathologic features, particularly Gleason grading system, have contributed significantly to the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of prostate cancer for decades. However, prostate cancer demonstrates enormous heterogeneity in biological behavior, thus establishing improved prognostic and predictive markers is particularly important to personalize therapy of men with clinically localized and newly diagnosed malignancy. Many automated grading systems have been developed for Gleason grading but acceptance in the medical community has been lacking due to poor interpretability. To overcome this problem, we developed a set of visually meaningful features to differentiate between low- and high-grade prostate cancer. The visually meaningful feature set consists of luminal and architectural features. For luminal features, we compute: 1) the shortest path from the nuclei to their closest luminal spaces; 2) ratio of the epithelial nuclei to the total number of nuclei. A nucleus is considered an epithelial nucleus if the shortest path between it and the luminal space does not contain any other nucleus; 3) average shortest distance of all nuclei to their closest luminal spaces. For architectural features, we compute directional changes in stroma and nuclei using directional filter banks. These features are utilized to create two subspaces; one for prostate images histopathologically assessed as low grade and the other for high grade. The grade associated with a subspace, which results in the minimum reconstruction error is considered as the prediction for the test image. For training, we utilized 43 regions of interest (ROI) images, which were extracted from 25 prostate whole slide images of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. For testing, we utilized an independent dataset of 88 ROIs extracted from 30 prostate whole slide images. The method resulted in 93.0% and 97.6% training and testing accuracies, respectively, for the spectrum of cases considered. The application of visually meaningful features provided promising levels of accuracy and consistency for grading prostate cancer.",Filter banks;Training;Prostate cancer;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Databases;Color deconvolution;cytological and architectural features;geodesic distance;shortest path,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2565515
An Automatic Tool for Quantification of Nerve Fibers in Corneal Confocal Microscopy Images,"We describe and evaluate an automated software tool for nerve-fiber detection and quantification in corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) images, combining sensitive nerve-fiber detection with morphological descriptors. Method: We have evaluated the tool for quantification of Diabetic Sensorimotor Polyneuropathy (DSPN) using both new and previously published morphological features. The evaluation used 888 images from 176 subjects (84 controls and 92 patients with type 1 diabetes). The patient group was further subdivided into those with (n = 63) and without (n = 29) DSPN. Results: We achieve improved nervefiber detection over previous results (91.7% sensitivity and specificity in identifying nerve-fiber pixels). Automatic quantification of nerve morphology shows a high correlation with previously reported, manually measured, features. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of both manual and automatic measurement regimes resulted in similar results in distinguishing patients with DSPN from those without: AUC of about 0.77 and 72% sensitivity-specificity at the equal error rate point. Conclusion: Automated quantification of corneal nerves in CCM images provides a sensitive tool for identification of DSPN. Its performance is equivalent to manual quantification, while improving speed and repeatability. Significance: CCM is a novel in vivo imaging modality that has the potential to be a noninvasive and objective image biomarker for peripheral neuropathy. Automatic quantification of nerve morphology is a major step forward in the early diagnosis and assessment of progression, and, in particular, for use in clinical trials to establish therapeutic benefit in diabetic and other peripheral neuropathies.",Diabetes;Feature extraction;Biomedical measurement;Microscopy;Discrete wavelet transforms;Training;Morphology;Computer aided diagnosis;corneal confocal microscopy (CCM);diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN);image analysis;nerve-fiber quantification,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2016.2573642
"Novel Methods for Microglia Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification","Segmentation and analysis of histological images provides a valuable tool to gain insight into the biology and function of microglial cells in health and disease. Common image segmentation methods are not suitable for inhomogeneous histology image analysis and accurate classification of microglial activation states has remained a challenge. In this paper, we introduce an automated image analysis framework capable of efficiently segmenting microglial cells from histology images and analyzing their morphology. The framework makes use of variational methods and the fast-split Bregman algorithm for image denoising and segmentation, and of multifractal analysis for feature extraction to classify microglia by their activation states. Experiments show that the proposed framework is accurate and scalable to large datasets and provides a useful tool for the study of microglial biology.",Data analysis;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Diseases;Morphology;Fast Fourier transforms;Microglia analysis;Mumford-Shah;fast split Bregman;fast Fourier transform;multifractal analysis;histology data analysis,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2016.2591520
Histopathological Image Classification With Color Pattern Random Binary Hashing-Based PCANet and Matrix-Form Classifier,"The computer-aided diagnosis for histopathological images has attracted considerable attention. Principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel deep learning algorithm for feature learning with the simple network architecture and parameters. In this study, a color pattern random binary hashing-based PCANet (C-RBH-PCANet) algorithm is proposed to learn an effective feature representation from color histopathological images. The color norm pattern and angular pattern are extracted from the principal component images of R, G, and B color channels after cascaded PCA networks. The random binary encoding is then performed on both color norm pattern images and angular pattern images to generate multiple binary images. Moreover, we rearrange the pooled local histogram features by spatial pyramid pooling to a matrix-form for reducing the dimension of feature and preserving spatial information. Therefore, a C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier-based feature learning and classification framework is proposed for diagnosis of color histopathological images. The experimental results on three color histopathological image datasets show that the proposed C-RBH-PCANet algorithm is superior to the original PCANet and other conventional unsupervised deep learning algorithms, while the best performance is achieved by the proposed feature learning and classification framework that combines C-RBH-PCANet and matrix-form classifier.",Image color analysis;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Histograms;Algorithm design and analysis;Image classification;Color angular pattern;color histopathological image;color norm pattern;matrix-form classifier;PCANet;random binary hashing,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2602823
Breast Histopathological Image Retrieval Based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation,"In the field of pathology, whole slide image (WSI) has become the major carrier of visual and diagnostic information. Content-based image retrieval among WSIs can aid the diagnosis of an unknown pathological image by finding its similar regions in WSIs with diagnostic information. However, the huge size and complex content of WSI pose several challenges for retrieval. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised, accurate, and fast retrieval method for a breast histopathological image. Specifically, the method presents a local statistical feature of nuclei for morphology and distribution of nuclei, and employs the Gabor feature to describe the texture information. The latent Dirichlet allocation model is utilized for high-level semantic mining. Locality-sensitive hashing is used to speed up the search. Experiments on a WSI database with more than 8000 images from 15 types of breast histopathology demonstrate that our method achieves about 0.9 retrieval precision as well as promising efficiency. Based on the proposed framework, we are developing a search engine for an online digital slide browsing and retrieval platform, which can be applied in computer-aided diagnosis, pathology education, and WSI archiving and management.",Feature extraction;Pathology;Semantics;Informatics;Breast;Image retrieval;Content-based image retrieval (CBIR);latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA);local statistical feature of nuclei (LSFN);whole slide image (WSI),ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2611615
Segmentation of White Blood Cells Image Using Adaptive Location and Iteration,"Segmentation of white blood cells (WBCs) image is meaningful but challenging due to the complex internal characteristics of the cells and external factors, such as illumination and different microscopic views. This paper addresses two problems of the segmentation: WBC location and subimage segmentation. To locate WBCs, a method that uses multiple windows obtained by scoring multiscale cues to extract a rectangular region is proposed. In this manner, the location window not only covers the whole WBC completely, but also achieves adaptive adjustment. In the subimage segmentation, the subimages preprocessed from the location window with a replace procedure are taken as initialization, and the GrabCut algorithm based on dilation is iteratively run to obtain more precise results. The proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated using a CellaVision dataset as well as a more challenging Jiashan dataset. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm is not only concise, but also can produce high-quality segmentations. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms other location and segmentation methods, yielding higher recall and better precision rates.",Image segmentation;Image edge detection;Image color analysis;Biomedical measurement;Informatics;White blood cells;Microscopy;Adaptive adjustment;GrabCut algorithm;image segmentation;location;white blood cell (WBC),ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2623421
Leukocytes Classification and Segmentation in Microscopic Blood Smear: A Resource-Aware Healthcare Service in Smart Cities,"Smart cities are a future reality for municipalities around the world. Healthcare services play a vital role in the transformation of traditional cities into smart cities. In this paper, we present a ubiquitous and quality computer-aided blood analysis service for the detection and counting of white blood cells (WBCs) in blood samples. WBCs also called leukocytes or leucocytes are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. Analysis of leukocytes provides valuable information to medical specialists, helping them in diagnosing different important hematic diseases, such as AIDS and blood cancer (Leukaemia). However, this task is prone to errors and can be time-consuming. A mobile-cloud-assisted detection and classification of leukocytes from blood smear images can enhance accuracy and speed up the detection of WBCs. In this paper, we propose a smartphone-based cloud-assisted resource aware framework for localization of WBCs within microscopic blood smear images using a trained multi-class ensemble classification mechanism in the cloud. In the proposed framework, nucleus is first segmented, followed by extraction of texture, statistical, and wavelet features. Finally, the detected WBCs are categorized into five classes: basophil, eosinophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte. Experimental results on numerous benchmark databases validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system in comparison to the other state-of-the-art schemes.",Smart cities;Medical services;Image classification;Feature extraction;White blood cells;Medical image processing;Cloud computing;Hematology;Healthcare in smart cities;haematology;image classification;image segmentation;leukocytes classification;mobile-cloud computing;medical image analysis,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2636218
Apertureless Near-Field Scanning Probes Based on Graphene Plasmonics,"We present a novel approach in designing high-throughput high-resolution apertureless near-field scanning probes with enhanced nanofocusing based on graphene plasmonics. Extremely localized plasmons on graphene are mingled with nanofocusing of surface plasmon polaritons to confine and steer the plasmon waves into the apex of a near-field scanning optical microscopy tip. The Fermi level, localized emission sites on graphene, and the angle of excitation play a critical role in exciting graphene surface plasmons on the lateral walls of the designed conical probes. The optimized probes feature full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) around 25 nm, which is at least two times smaller than conventional metallic plasmonic tips. The near-field electromagnetic properties of the designed probes are characterized in detail and compared to the conventional single-aperture and typical apertureless metallic plasmonic (silver and gold) probes. Over three orders of magnitude electric field enhancement compared to metallic probes on SiO2 substrate has been achieved.",Graphene;Plasmons;Probes;Optical surface waves;Permittivity;Surface waves;Biomedical optical imaging;Plasmonics;nanostructures;microscopy;fabrication and characterization,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Photonics Journal,10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2657322
Detection of malaria parasites using digital image processing,"Malaria is a very serious infectious disease caused by a peripheral blood parasite of the genus Plasmodium. Conventional microscopy, which is currently “the gold standard” for malaria diagnosis has occasionally proved inefficient since it is time consuming and results are difficult to reproduce. As it poses a serious global health problem, automation of the evaluation process is of high importance. In this work, an accurate, rapid and affordable model of malaria diagnosis using stained thin blood smear images was developed. The method made use of the intensity features of Plasmodium parasites and erythrocytes. Images of infected and non-infected erythrocytes were acquired, pre-processed, relevant features extracted from them and eventually diagnosis was made based on the features extracted from the images. A set of features based on intensity have been proposed, and the performance of these features on the red blood cell samples from the created database have been evaluated using an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. The results have shown that these features could be successfully used for malaria detection.",Diseases;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Gray-scale;Microscopy;Red blood cells;Malaria;erythrocyte;Parasite;Digital Image Processing;gray-scale image,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 International Conference on Communication, Control, Computing and Electronics Engineering (ICCCCEE)",10.1109/ICCCCEE.2017.7867644
A Dataset and a Technique for Generalized Nuclear Segmentation for Computational Pathology,"Nuclear segmentation in digital microscopic tissue images can enable extraction of high-quality features for nuclear morphometrics and other analysis in computational pathology. Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other H&E-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images.",Image segmentation;Measurement;Training;Machine learning;Image color analysis;Pathology;Diseases;Annotation;boundaries;dataset;deep learning;nuclear segmentation;nuclei,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2017.2677499
Automated Disease Identification With 3-D Optical Imaging: A Medical Diagnostic Tool,"Digital holographic microscopy is an ideal tool for 3-D cell imaging and characterization.

Evaluation of Hair and Scalp Condition Based on Microscopy Image Analysis,"Due to the rapid deployment of IT technology, health care service has entered a new era. Some services such as cardiac monitoring are critical for life and have contributed to saving lives. On the other hand, monitoring hair loss is another interesting health care service. Even though it is not critical for life, people tend to pay much attention to their hair condition. Hair loss is one of the major issues related to the hair condition since excessive and uncared hair loss might lead to bald head. Hair care can be done professionally at the hair care shop but it requires much time and cost. Recently, due to inexpensive smart devices, self-diagnosis on the hair condition has become possible. Still, few applications have been developed to evaluate hair condition. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to evaluate the condition of hair and scalp by extracting diverse features from their microscopy image. The features include hair thickness, hair density and scalp blotch. We show the effectiveness of our scheme by extensive experiments on the prototype system.",Hair;Scalp;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Cameras;Image analysis;Skeleton,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 International Conference on Platform Technology and Service (PlatCon),10.1109/PlatCon.2017.7883708
Low Dimensional Representation of Fisher Vectors for Microscopy Image Classification,"Microscopy image classification is important in various biomedical applications, such as cancer subtype identification, and protein localization for high content screening. To achieve automated and effective microscopy image classification, the representative and discriminative capability of image feature descriptors is essential. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new feature representation algorithm to facilitate automated microscopy image classification. In particular, we incorporate Fisher vector (FV) encoding with multiple types of local features that are handcrafted or learned, and we design a separation-guided dimension reduction method to reduce the descriptor dimension while increasing its discriminative capability. Our method is evaluated on four publicly available microscopy image data sets of different imaging types and applications, including the UCSB breast cancer data set, MICCAI 2015 CBTC challenge data set, and IICBU malignant lymphoma, and RNAi data sets. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed low-dimensional FV representation, showing consistent performance improvement over the existing state of the art and the commonly used dimension reduction techniques.",Microscopy;Biomedical imaging;Breast cancer;Biomarkers;Feature extraction;Fisher vector;feature learning;dimensionality reduction;discriminative learning,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2017.2687466
Hemozoin and hemoglobin characterization by optical absorption towards a miniaturized spectrophotometric malaria diagnostic system,"Malaria is a parasitic disease with high prevalence in regions with inefficient healthcare conditions. Currently, the most used diagnostic methods in endemic regions are microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests by immunochromatographic assays. This work proposes an alternative miniaturized optical diagnostic method by spectrophotometry, for hemozoin (Hz) and hemoglobin (Hb) quantification and classification. Hz is a subproduct of the malaria parasite, produced by degradation of Hb, inside the red blood cells and, as the malaria parasite is proliferating, the Hz concentration increases and the Hb decreases. Hz and Hb have typical absorption spectra, with characteristic absorption peaks, that change their shape according to their concentrations. In this work, it was studied the optical absorbance of Hz and whole blood (WB) samples, with different concentrations of both Hz and Hb. Additionally, with the aim of miniaturization, different solution volumes and different optical paths were considered. The miniaturization capacity was tested using 1 mm optical path quartz cuvettes and 3 mm optical path polydimethylsiloxane wells, where WB samples with different Hz concentration were introduced. The results showed high linearity of the absorbance curve, as a function of the concentration, with R2 between 0.99 and 0.97, for volumes of 350 μΕ with 1 mm optical path and 21.2 μΕ with 3 mm optical path, respectively, and proved the accuracy of the method.

Computerized measurement of melanoma depth of invasion in skin biopsy images,"Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and its depth of invasion (DoI) is an important factor used by pathologist for grading the severity of skin disease. In this paper, we propose an automated technique for measuring melanoma DoI in MART1 stained skin histopathological images. The proposed technique first segments skin melanoma areas based on image color features. The skin epidermis is then segmented by a multi-thresholding method. After that, the skin granular layer is identified based on Bayesian classification of segmented epidermis pixels. Finally, the melanoma DoI is computed using a Hausdorff distance measure. Experiments on 28 skin biopsy images show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance in measuring the melanoma DoI than two closely related works.",Malignant tumors;Epidermis;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Dermis;Training,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI),10.1109/BHI.2017.7897194
Automated histologic grading from free-text pathology reports using graph-of-words features and machine learning,"Traditional n-gram feature representation of freetext documents often fails to capture word ordering and semantics, thus compromising text comprehension. Graph-of-words, a new text representation approach based on graph analytics, is a superior method overcoming the limitations by modeling word co-occurrence. In this study, we present a novel application of graph-of-words text description for automated extraction of histologic grade from unstructured pathology reports. Using 10-fold cross-validation tests, the proposed approach resulted in substantially higher macro and micro-F1 scores with undirected graph-of-words features, compared to traditional bi-gram text features.

Segmentation of fluorescence microscopy images using three dimensional active contours with inhomogeneity correction,"Image segmentation is an important step in the quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy data. Since fluorescence microscopy volumes suffer from intensity inhomogeneity, low image contrast and limited depth resolution, poor edge details, and irregular structure shape, segmentation still remains a challenging problem. This paper describes a nuclei segmentation method for fluorescence microscopy based on the use of three dimensional (3D) active contours with inhomogeneity correction. The correction information utilizes 3D volume information while addressing intensity inhomogeneity across vertical and horizontal directions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than other reported methods.",Three-dimensional displays;Nonhomogeneous media;Image segmentation;Active contours;Microscopy;Image resolution;Image edge detection;image segmentation;fluorescence microscopy;multiphoton microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017),10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950618
Automated prostate glandular and nuclei detection using hyperspectral imaging,"Detection and segmentation of glandular structures are important, since these structures contain clinical relevant information regarding the disease status and Gleason grade of prostate cancer. Manual gland segmentation process is very time consuming and subjective, also existing automated methods are not robust and reliable. We set out to design an automated, fast and objective method. In this paper we present an automated methodology for automated detection of structures of interest in digitalized histopathology images of a Tissue Micro Array (TMA). We show a successful method for detection of prostate glandular structures and its nuclei. Our method integrates different techniques: (1) construct hyperspectral transmission images using sixteen light wavelengths, (2) use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct new RGB images, (3) use clustering to segment different structures in an unsupervised fashion, and (4) apply post-processing morphological cleaning as the final step in our pipeline. We detected 80% plus of the glandular structure in 61% of cores, 80% -50% of the glands in 15% of cores and less than 50% of the glands in 24% of cores.",Glands;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Principal component analysis;Prostate cancer;Prostate Cancer;Glandular Structure;Hyper Spectral Imaging;Morphological Structure;Image processing;Clustering,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017),10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950691
Disease grading of heterogeneous tissue using convolutional autoencoder,"One of the main challenges of histological image analysis is the high dimensionality of the images. This can be addressed via summarizing techniques or feature engineering. However, such approaches can limit the performance of subsequent machine learning models, particularly when dealing with highly heterogeneous tissue samples. One possible alternative is to employ unsupervised learning to determine the most relevant features automatically. In this paper, we propose a method of generating representative image signatures that are robust to tissue heterogeneity. At the core of our approach lies a novel deep-learning based mechanism to simultaneously produce representative image features as well as perform dictionary learning to further reduce dimensionality. By integrating this mechanism in a broader framework for disease grading, we show significant improvement in terms of grading accuracy compared to alternative local feature extraction methods.",Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Diseases;Image color analysis;Image reconstruction;Training;Morphology;Image Description;Convolutional Autoencoder;Tissue Heterogeneity;Dimensionality Reduction,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017),10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950591
Automated level set segmentation of histopathologic cells with sparse shape prior support and dynamic occlusion constraint,"In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation method for cells in histopathologic images based on a sparse shape prior guided variational level set framework. We automate the cell contour initialization by detecting seeds and deform contours by minimizing a new energy functional that incorporates a shape term involving sparse shape priors, an adaptive contour occlusion penalty term, and a boundary term encouraging contours to converge to strong edges. As a result, our approach is able to accommodate mutual occlusions and detect contours of multiple intersected cells. We apply our algorithm to a set of whole-slide histopathologic images of brain tumor sections. The proposed method is compared with other popular methods, and demonstrates good accuracy for cell segmentation by quantitative measures, suggesting its promise to support biomedical image-based investigations.",Shape;Level set;Image segmentation;Tumors;Sparse matrices;Detection algorithms;Computer science;Cell Segmentation;Level Set;Shape Priors;Sparse Representation,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017),10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950620
Classification of adrenal lesions through spatial Bayesian modeling of GLCM,"Radiomics, an emerging field of quantitative imaging, encompasses a broad class of analytical techniques. Recent literature have interrogated associations between quantitatively derived GLCM-based texture features and clinical/pathology information using machine learning algorithms in many cancer settings, but often fail to elucidate the predictive power of these features. Moreover, for many cancers characterized by complex histopathological profiles, such as adrenocortical carcinoma, reducing the multivariate functional structure of GLCM to a set of summary statistics is potentially reductive, masking the patterns that distinguish malignancy from benignity. We develop a Bayesian probabilistic framework for predictive classification of lesion types, based on the entire GLCM. Our method, which uses a spatial Gaussian random field to model dependencies among neighboring cells of the GLCMs, was applied in a cancer detection context to discriminant malignant from benign adrenal lesions using GLCMs arising from non-contrast CT scans. Our method is shown to yield improved predictive power both in simulations as well as the adrenal CT application when compared to state-of-the-art diagnostic algorithms that use GLCM derived features.",Lesions;Bayes methods;Cancer;Computed tomography;Predictive models;Data models;Gaussian distribution;Bayesian modeling;discriminant analysis;Gaussian Markov Random Field;Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix;Prediction accuracy;lesion classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017),10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950489
Adapting fisher vectors for histopathology image classification,"Histopathology image classification can provide automated support towards cancer diagnosis. In this paper, we present a transfer learning-based approach for histopathology image classification. We first represent the image feature by Fisher Vector (FV) encoding of local features that are extracted using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model pretrained on ImageNet. Next, to better transfer the pretrained model to the histopathology image dataset, we design a new adaptation layer to further transform the FV descriptors for higher discriminative power and classification accuracy. We used the publicly available BreaKHis image dataset for classifying between benign and malignant breast tumors, and obtained improved performance over the state-of-the-art.",Adaptation models;Cancer;Feature extraction;Training;Image coding;Biological system modeling;Support vector machines;Convolutional Neural Network;Fisher Vector;transfer learning;image classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017),10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950592
Coupled shape priors for dynamic segmentation of dendritic spines,"Segmentation of biomedical images is a challenging task, especially when there is low quality or missing data. The use of prior information can provide significant assistance for obtaining more accurate results. In this paper we propose a new approach for dendritic spine segmentation from microscopic images over time, which is motivated by incorporating shape information from previous time points to segment a spine in the current time point. In particular, using a training set consisting of spines in two consecutive time points to construct coupled shape priors, and given the segmentation in the previous time point, we can improve the segmentation process of the spine in the current time point. Our approach has been evaluated on 2-photon microscopy images of dendritic spines and its effectiveness has been demonstrated by both visual and quantitative results.",Shape;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Visualization;Training;Manuals;Neck;Dynamic segmentation;dendritic spine seg­mentation;2-photon microscopy;nonparametric shape priors;coupled shape priors,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 25th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU),10.1109/SIU.2017.7960599
3B dendritic spine segmentation using nonparametric shape priors,"Analyzing morphological and structural changes of dendritic spines in 2-photon microscopy images in time is important for neuroscience researchers. Correct segmentation of dendritic spines is an important step of developing robust and reliable automatic tools for such analysis. In this paper, we propose an approach for segmentation of 3D dendritic spines using nonparametric shape priors. The proposed method learns the prior distribution of shapes through Parzen density estimation on the training set of shapes. Then, the posterior distribution of shapes is obtained by combining the learned prior distribution with a data term in a Bayesian framework. Finally, the segmentation result that maximizes the posterior is found using active contours. Experimental results demonstrate that using nonparametric shape priors leads to better 3D dendritic spine segmentation results.",Shape;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Three-dimensional displays;Dogs;Neuroscience;Tools;3D dendritic spine segmentation;nonparametric shape priors;Parzen density estimator;level sets,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 25th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU),10.1109/SIU.2017.7960482
Aging feature extraction of oil-impregnated insulating paper using image texture analysis,"Under long-term synergy effect of multi-factors, especially the thermal stress, insulating paper will be degraded and its insulation performance will decline due to carbonization and degradation of cellulose. This paper presents an optical approach for aging feature extraction of the insulating paper, where one of the image processing methods called texture analysis is utilized. By conducting laboratory accelerated thermal aging tests, insulating paper samples with different aging conditions for both Nomex and Kraft, evaluated with the aging time, are prepared. After taking optical microscopic images of insulating paper samples belong to different aging groups, up to 14 texture features are extracted using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). With different feature selection methods applied, several of them are finally selected to represent the aging condition of insulating. Numerical tests with both supervised and unsupervised algorithms, as well as a linear regression method verifies the validity of these features in characterizing the aging condition of the insulating paper.",Aging;Feature extraction;Insulation;Optical imaging;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Condition monitoring;Feature extraction;insulating paper;texture analysis;gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM);aging condition assessment,ARTICLE,2017,IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation,10.1109/TDEI.2017.006319
Fungus Detection Through Optical Sensor System Using Two Different Kinds of Feature Vectors for the Classification,"This revolutionary era emphasizes the need of novel, simple, automatic fungal detection system to control the devastation caused by fungal species. Fungus is highly notorious for human health, food, and archives. We have developed a device and algorithms to automatically detect fungus from air by employing optical sensor system. Several air samples were collected and examined under high magnification microscopic camera in order to take images of samples through the designed system. System collects three different types of images (dark-field, bright-field, and auto fluorescence) with the help of different light sources. This provided detailed temporal variation of fungus spores to effectively analyze fungus images. Two different algorithms were developed for fungus spore detection: hand crafted features and histogram of oriented gradients as features. Then, support vector machine was used for the purpose of classification. Furthermore, we compared the fungus spores count obtained with our algorithm and manual counting method. The performance of the proposed system on new images obtained by the optical sensor system was evaluated and all results of precision, recall, and accuracy are also presented in the paper. Convincing results were obtained in favor of the proposed approach for precision recall ratios. The obtained results proved the possibility of developing a device for early detection of several types of fungus spores.

AFM-based robust image analysis to contrast reversal effects in cell-cerium oxide nanoparticles interactions,"Atomic force microscopy is gaining interest as a technique to quantitatively study biological samples in native environment. However, the measuring principles behind may cause the presence of different sources of artifacts and image degradations. In this work, we present an AFM image analysis tool able to recognize morphological alterations in human leukemia cells after 3 h incubation with the antioxidant cerium oxide nanoparticles. To demonstrate the robustness of the approach to a particular artifact called contrast reversal (CR) effect, consisting in an unexpected switching between repulsive and attractive tip regime during scanning, we present a technique to artificially inject the artefact on the image and then apply the tool. Maximum area under the ROC (AUC) curve results of 0.91 (0.11) in the discrimination between exposed and unexposed cells confirm the validity of the approach and its applicability in AFM-based cell studies.",Image analysis;Nanoparticles;Force;Feature extraction;Robustness;Biology;Microscopy;Atomic Force Microscopy;Contrast Reversal Effect;Image Analysis;Image Segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC),10.1109/I2MTC.2017.7969970
The Effect of Oligohydramnios on Tissue and Cellular Morphometry in the Developing Fetal Murine Lung,"Mechanical forces play important roles in fetal lung development, therefore, pulmonary hypoplasia is an expected response to Oligohydramnios (OH) due to the decrease of fluid pressure. Amniotic sacs were punctured in pregnant mice with untouched fetuses serving as controls. Fetuses were delivered, and lung tissues collected. Histological sections were imaged and analyzed at the tissue level and the cellular level. Various morphometric descriptors of size, shape and differentiation were used to compare tissues from OH and untouched controls. Our results show that OH leads to smaller, less developed air spaces when compared to controls. Furthermore, cells from OH fetuses are smaller and less regular in shape compared to controls. There is also a defect in the differentiation of Type I alveolar epithelial cells. Here, we show a significant change in the morphometry of the fetal lung as a result of OH. These changes are consistent with the observed pulmonary hypoplasia and are important objective parameters that help in elucidating mechanisms of lung development and potential management of OH induced pulmonary hypoplasia.",Lungs;Aerospace electronics;Shape;Fractals;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Fluids;Oligohydramnios;image analysis;morphometry;fractal dimension;pulmonary hypoplasia,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 21st International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science (CSCS),10.1109/CSCS.2017.52
Supervised Classification of Breast Cancer Malignancy Using Integrated Modified Marker Controlled Watershed Approach,"Worldwide statistics inform that breast cancer occupies second position causing mortality among women. Symptomatic detection of the disease in its early stage is important for treatment to help the internists and radiologists in their diagnosis. In the proposed module, nuclei locations are obtained using Hough Transform. Nuclei Segmentation of the pre-processed Hematoxylin and Eosin stained breast cancer histopathological images is done using Proposed Modified - Marker Controlled Watershed Approach (MMCWA). Small fixed Structuring Element (SE) size removes respective bright and dark details during opening and closing morphology & large SE size removes huge contour details of the input image. So, in the proposed MMCWA, by using weighted variance method, the adaptive Structuring Element size of the SE map is obtained to protect all details in the image. A total of 20 features, including 5 shape based features and 15 texture features were extracted for classification using Decision Trees, SVM and KNN classifiers. Algorithmic performance evaluation is accomplished and proved that the proposed integrated MMCWA provides better results than the traditional marker controlled watershed. The proposed module was trained with 96 images and tested over 24 images taken from the digital database.",Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Entropy;Breast cancer;Ducts;H&E stained breast cancer histopathological images;Biomedical image processing;Image segmentation;Modified Marker Controlled Watershed Approach;Support vector machines,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 7th International Advance Computing Conference (IACC),10.1109/IACC.2017.0125
Microscopic image enhancement of Chinese Herbal Medicine based on fuzzy set,"In order to simply and effectively extract important feature information and improve the accuracy of microscopic image recognition of Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM), a kind of microscopic image enhancement technique of CHM based on fuzzy sets is put forward. Fuzzy set describes the vague degree of information, which study the different objects belong to the same class of membership relations. Implementation of fuzzy image enhancement of CHM has three steps that is image fuzzy feature extraction, the correction of a subordinate function values and fuzzy domain inverse transform. Firstly, from the spatial domain to the blurred domain, the blur feature of the microscopic image of CHM is extracted through a certain transformation. Secondly, the membership degree of function of the fuzzy enhancement operator is modified by varying the regression. Finally, a new gray level image is formed by the inverse transform, so that the data is transformed from the image blur domain to the spatial domain and the original image is enhanced. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method provides a good visual effect for image recognition and make it easier to the detection and identify for the target area.",Fuzzy sets;Image enhancement;Feature extraction;Finite element analysis;Electron microscopy;Laplace equations;image enhancement;fuzzy set;microscopic image;Chinese herbal medicine,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 2nd International Conference on Image, Vision and Computing (ICIVC)",10.1109/ICIVC.2017.7984565
Classification of human sperm heads using elliptic features and LDA,"For diagnosis of infertility in men semen analysis is conducted in which sperm morphology i.e. the size and shape of the sperm, is one of the factors that are evaluated. Since manual assessment of sperm morphology is time consuming and subjective, automatic classification methods are being developed. Automatic classification of sperm heads is a complicated task due to the “within class” differences and “between class” similarities. To automatically classify the sperms, appropriate features should be extracted from their microscopic images. In this research, a set of previously proposed features is extracted and examined in an automatic framework in order to evaluate their discriminating capacity in classifying sperms into four classes of shapes (Normal, Tapered, Pyriform and Amorphous). Also, a new set of features called elliptic features is proposed and added to the original features to improve the classification results. Both sets of features are used with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. It is shown that adding these new features, significantly improves the discrimination between those classes of sperm shapes.",Head;Feature extraction;Shape;Morphology;Manuals;Linear discriminant analysis;Active contours;sperm head classificatin;sperm abnormality;sperm morphology;infertility;eliptic features,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 3rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (IPRIA),10.1109/PRIA.2017.7983036
Phenotyping of xylem vessels for drought stress analysis in rice,"Xylem vessels play a pivotal role in plant adaptation to drought stress. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that associates automatic segmentation of xylem vessels with its morphological features as a quantitative proxy to predict drought stress response (DSR). We develop an image processing pipeline that comprises of low level processing which enables high-throughput detection of xylem vessels. With no prior information about its size and location, the proposed detection methodology gives an accuracy of 98%. The labelled data for DSR are either not available or are subjectively developed, which is a low-throughput and error prone task. We resolve this problem by employing simplex volume maximization (SiVM) algorithm. The convex representations obtained from SiVM for each xylem in microscopic images based on its shape factors are aggregated to get an automated scoring of the whole plant. Bhattacharya distance is then employed to obtain the divergence of these responses w.r.t. the control group.

Patterned microwell arrays for single-cell analysis and drug screening,"Nowadays, cells are commonly used for predicting whether the drug compounds will be effective and safe in human. The response of cell groups was usually analyzed, instead of single cell. However, individual cells within the same population even shows various characteristics. Understanding this heterogeneity is critical to studying how effective therapies will be in the clinic. Therefore, highly efficient analysis of single cell has become important for cellular biologists for both fundamental and drug screening. Recently, several methods including microscopy, laser capture microdissection, flow cytometry and microfluidic techniques have been developed for study the single cell. However, miniaturization, simplification and multifunction are still main challenges for the development of single cell analytical tool. In this paper, we have presented an easy-to-use and versatile method to fabricate various microwells for single cell analysis. Cells could grow into arbitrary shapes with constrained microwells.

A fuzzy based classifier for diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia using blood smear image processing,"Leukemia is a kind of blood disorder and its early diagnosis plays an important role in preventing the rapid progression of the disease. The main objective of the research is how to use fuzzy concepts for deriving a proper classifier for diagnosis of this disorder in microscopic image of a patient's peripheral blood smears.

Chip-scale fluorescence imager for in vivo microscopic cancer detection,"Modern cancer treatment faces the pervasive challenge of identifying microscopic cancer foci in vivo, but no imaging device exists with the ability to identify these cells intraoperatively, where they can be removed.

The sensor's miniature size enables manipulation within a small, morphologically complex, tumor cavity. Recognizing that focusing optics traditionally used in fluorescence imagers present a barrier to miniaturization, we integrate stacked CMOS metal layers above each photodiode to form angle-selective gratings, rejecting background light and deblurring the image.

Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification: Is Magnification Important?,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer in women worldwide. It is typically diagnosed via histopathological microscopy imaging, for which image analysis can aid physicians for more effective diagnosis. Given a large variability in tissue appearance, to better capture discriminative traits, images can be acquired at different optical magnifications. In this paper, we propose an approach which utilizes joint colour-texture features and a classifier ensemble for classifying breast histopathology images.

Recognition of protozoan parasites from microscopic images: Eimeria species in chickens and rabbits as a case study,"Automated diagnosis and identification of diseases and conditions such as parasites from microscopic images have been mainly carried out by utilizing the object morphological characteristics. The extraction of morphometric features needs the use of highly complex techniques that require computational power. Therefore, in order to reduce this complexity, this paper presents an automated identification based on analyzing three groups of pixel-based feature sets: column features (CF), row features (RF), and the third one (CRF) obtained by merging CF and RF together. For the classification task, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been applied. The classification results have been evaluated by adapting a 5-fold cross validation. Additionally, a robust sub-set of the features has been selected by Relieff feature selection method to prevent overfitting, which in turn has improved the final results. Two microscopic image slide databases of a type of protozoan parasites genus called Eimeria in fowls and rabbits have been examined in order to assess the robustness of the proposed methods. The highest accuracy rates obtained when the entire features were used are 85.55% (±0.39%) and 96.6% (±0.82%) from grey-scale level and color images, respectively. These results have been increased by 5% when the feature size is reduced by two thirds when Relieff was utilized.

Novel method for joining missing line fragments for medical image analysis,"We present a method of predictive reconstructing connections between parts of object outlines in images. The method was developed mainly to analyze microscopic medical images but is applicable to other types of images. Examined objects in such images are highly transparent, moreover close objects can overlap each other. Thus, segmentation and separation of such objects can be difficult. Another frequently occurring problem is partial blur due to high image magnification. Large focal length of a microscope dramatically narrows the range of sharp image (depth of field). The method is based on edge detection to extract object contours and represent them in a vector form. The logic behind the presented method refers to the Gestalt Laws describing human perception. The method, according to the law of good continuation and the principle of similarity, evaluates the neighborhood the interrupted contour path, and then tries to determine the most appropriate connection with the other parts of the contour. To assess the similarity of contour parts, the method examines the orientation of the line determined by the gradient of the edge, the characteristics of the edge cross section and the direction of its current course. In order to reduce the amount of data and accelerate the method, fragments of detected outlines are represented by vectors in the form of a graph. Thus, the method has faster access to the information on the course of the edges than in the case of bitmap-based representations.",Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image analysis;Shape;Detectors;Pollution,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR),10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046941
LLC encoded BoW features and softmax regression for microscopic image classification,"This paper proposes a method based on the bag-of-words (BoW) and the softmax regression for microscopic image classification. Essentially, the locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) is adopted for local feature encoding. Compared with the traditionally adopted vector quantization (VQ) in the BoW framework, the LLC encodes local structures of microscopic images with lower quantization errors and generates a sparse image representation. This enables the use of linear classifiers with low computational complexity. A softmax regression classifier is then adopted to address the multi-categorical classification task where the confidence of categorical prediction is quantified by posterior probabilities. Compared with other linear classifiers (such as the linear SVM) which only assign labels to images, such probabilistic outputs provide extra quantitative information to analyze misclassified images. Our experiments on the 2D-Hela and the PAP smear data sets show significant performance improvement of the proposed method comparing with competing methods using different features and classifiers under the BoW framework.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Training;Visualization;Support vector machines;Dictionaries;Encoding;bag-of-words (BoW);locality-constrained linear coding (LLC);softmax regression classifier;microscopic image,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050243

In the proposed method, first the images are pre-processed in order to remove noise variations occurs due to microscope lenses and different lighting conditions. This step makes the proposed algorithm more robust to those noise conditions. Next to this, image segmentation is performed using histogram based adaptive thresholding followed by mathematical morphological operations. The segmented images are used further to detect infected red blood cell (RBC) by the malaria parasite. The detection of infected RBC is done using unsupervised learning technique, which makes the detection process faster. The proposed algorithm is experimented on the different images and it shows that the proposed algorithm is suitable for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of Malaria disease.",Diseases;Microscopy;Blood;Image segmentation;Histograms;Organizations;Lenses,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN),10.1109/SPIN.2017.8050013
Pathological automatic classification of hepatocellular carcinoma based on adaptive weighted multi-classifier fusion,"In order to assist doctors in predicting the pathological information of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we proposed an automatic histological grading method of HCC based on adaptive weighted multi-classifier fusion in this paper. First, five sets of texture features were extracted for each region of interest (ROI), corresponding to first order statistics, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, gray-level run-length matrix, Haar wavelet and local binary pattern. Secondly, we selected five single-layer classifiers in the commonly used classifiers for the five feature sets. Thirdly, based on the k-nearest neighbor method and the weighted similarity value, the adaptive dynamic weights of each classifier were calculated. Finally, majority voting procedure was adopted to realize multi-classifier fusion. 192 MRI images of 46 histologically proven HCCs were retrospectively studied. The best classification accuracy (97.06%) was achieved by our method, and the accuracy of different pathological classification were respectively 98.04% (well differentiation) and 96.08% (poorly differentiation). The comparative assessment of the various kind of classification shows that our method, which combining five single-layer classifiers of different types with the adaptive weighted voting rule, is relatively accurate to assist pathological diagnosis of HCCs from enhanced MRI images.",Pathology;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Wavelet transforms;Support vector machines;hepatocellular carcinoma;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;single-layer classifier;Adaptive weight;multi-classifier fusion;automatic histological grading,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 IEEE 2nd Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)",10.1109/IAEAC.2017.8054261
Skin disease recognition using texture analysis,"This research describes skin disease recognition by using neural network which based on the texture analysis. There are many skin diseases which have a lot of similarities in their symptoms, such as Measles (rubeola), German measles (rubella), and Chickenpox etc. In general, these diseases have similarities in pattern of infection and symptoms such as redness and rash. Diagnosis and recognition of skin disease take a very long term process because it requires patient's history, physical examination and proper laboratory diagnostic tests. Not only that, it also requires large number of features clinical as well as histopathological for analysis and to provide further treatment. The disease diagnosis and recognition becomes difficult as the complexity and number of features of the disease increases. Hence, a computer aided diagnosis and recognition system is introduced. Computer algorithm which contains few steps that involves image processing, image feature extraction and classification of data have been implemented with the help of classifier such as artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN can learn patterns of symptoms of particular diseases and provides faster diagnosis and recognition than a human physician. Thus, the patients can do the treatment for the skin disease faced immediately based on the symptoms detected.",Skin;Diseases;Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Artificial neural networks;Malignant tumors;skin disease;classification by NN;segmentation;GLCM features,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 8th Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium (ICSGRC),10.1109/ICSGRC.2017.8070584
Diagnosing Leukemia from Microscopic Images Using Image Analysis and Processing Techniques,"Image processing and analysis paves the way to extract cum quantify objects and patterns in image data, it also enables to find answers to meaningful biological questions. Microscopy images in biology are often found to be complex and noisy. The diagnosing of blood disorders plays a very crucial role in the timely detection and curing of disease in the medical field and thereby protecting and saving human life. We discuss in this paper, a proposed framework for segmenting the white blood cell using Otsu's global threshold method, and then by routing it to morphological minimum filter the darkest part of the image is identified as 'Nucleus'. Then the image is subjected to the process of feature extraction to obtain its geometric features information such as the size and shape of a nucleus, area, perimeter, eccentricity, circularity and solidity and the obtained results are explained.",Cells (biology);Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Shape;Microscopy;White blood cells;Segmentation;global threshold;Geometric feature,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 World Congress on Computing and Communication Technologies (WCCCT),10.1109/WCCCT.2016.63
Dermedys: Android-based dermatological diagnostic and analytic expert system,"This paper describes a study to develop a ubiquitous expert system that aims to diagnose dermatological ailment present in a user. Diagnosing dermatological ailments has proven challenging due to the characteristic similarity in the symptoms of various diseases which usually require biopsies that are difficult to accurately read. This has brought about artificial intelligence researches into the automated means of accurately diagnosing such diseases. The algorithms, which have been designed although with nearly 98% of accuracies, are usually too heavy to work on pervasive systems, and also require histopathological inputs from the user. In this study, a system implementing a backward chaining algorithm using logical inferences, abduction, deduction, and induction was designed in such a way that it is lightweight enough to run on mobile phones.

Prognostic prediction of histopathological images by local binary patterns and RUSBoost,"A high recurrence rate, and progression to higher stages are observed for patients diagnosed with urothelial car-cinoma (previously known as transitional cell carcinoma). Low prognostic value of the current grading systems result in extensive follow-up of patients for multiple years after first diagnosis. Although, the aid of computer systems for prognosis prediction of superficial urothelial carcinomas have been proposed, earlier analyses have been focused on using morphological features of cells and attributes describing the patient. In this study, we propose a system to aid in the prediction of prognostic information based on a texture analysis of histopathological images of superficial urothelial carcinoma. The analyses are conducted using the local binary pattern (LBP) and local variance (VAR) operators followed by a RUSBoost classifier. A dataset of 42 patients, consisting of 13 patients without recurrence, 14 with recurrence but not progression and 15 patients with progression are studied.

Correlative investigations of biological specimens using label free far-field and near-field microscopy techniques,"Summary form only given. Laser Scanning Microscopy (LSM) techniques play in current days a key role in imaging and characterizing biological tissues. Among these, Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM), with its two main variants: Two-Photon Excitation Fluorescence (TPEF) and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate unprocessed tissues with resolution and detail comparable to standard histology. This is achieved by exploiting endogenous optical signals generated by the tissues upon interaction with a femtosecond laser beam used as excitation. The main optical signals that can be probed by MPM for in-vivo/ex-vivo characterization and diagnostics tasks are autofluorescence generated by endogenous chromophores, such as the enzyme cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or flavin adenine dinucleotide and harmonic generations originated from noncentro-symmetric molecules present in the biological tissues, such as myosin, tubulin or collagen. These optical signals can provide valuable information over aspects such as abnormal cell morphology, size variation of cell nuclei, or modifications in the architecture of the extracellular matrix, all of these being important indicators for a wide range of pathologies, including cancers or neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, the lateral resolution that can be achieved by using such LSM techniques is limited by diffraction, which impedes an exact understanding of many fundamental structures and processes at cellular and sub-cellular levels. Apertureless Scanning Near-Field Optical microscopy (ASNOM) holds significant potential for resolving cellular and tissular features of physiological and pathological relevance at optical resolutions lying at nano-scale. However, due to the limited body of work performed so far in the ASNOM bioimaging area, the interpretation of near-field data sets collected using variants such as scattering-type SNOM or Second Harmonic Generation SNOM can be very cumbersome in the absence of supporting information. On the other hand, collecting supporting information with separate systems is not always easy. Investigating corresponding sample regions using systems that are based on different contrast mechanisms is often a difficult task (and sometimes impossible). Moreover, identifying sample regions of interest after switching between imaging systems working at different resolution scales is usually time demanding In this contribution we present a series of experiments aimed at imaging biological specimens using a recently developed architecture. This multimodal imaging system allows the acquisition of optical data sets on overlapping field-of-views at both microand nano-scale resolutions, in the far-field and near-field regimes, by several techniques. Characterization sessions with the incorporated techniques can take place at closely consecutive or overlapping time points, which represents a major advantage when considering samples with time-dependent properties. The contrast mechanisms of the embedded imaging techniques provide complementary information (see Fig. 1), which plays a key role in facilitating scene understanding and interpretation.",Biomedical optical imaging;Nonlinear optics;Optical harmonic generation;Optical imaging;Optical scattering;Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087206
Digital holography of total internal reflection to image cell/substrate contacts,"Looking at the interfaces is very important for many biological and chemical applications: from the imaging of thin polymeric films to the study of cell/substrate interactions. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) and Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) are usually the techniques of choice when high sensitivity of measurement is required. They yield information about few hundreds of nanometers from the contact surface and had proven themselves as a good tool for the characterization of thin films, cellular focal adhesions and biomolecular binding events. Moreover, they can be used either to excite fluorescent markers or in a label-free fashion. Digital Holography (DH) in microscope configuration is already a common tool to image microstructures and biological systems because of its excellent approach in obtaining intensity and quantitative phase information on a light-wave. In particular, prism-based configurations have been used to combine easily DH with total internal reflection (TIR) and SPRi [1-3]. Unfortunately, the physical constraint of the prism limits both the numerical aperture (NA) and magnification of an imaging system. Hence, it yields a poor spatial resolution compared to that achievable with optical microscopy. Moreover, resolution in prism-based imaging is mainly governed by geometrical aberrations, which distort images and, moreover, the prism limits the compatibility with conventional microscopes [4].",Microscopy;Reflection;Holography;Optical microscopy;Adhesives;Spatial resolution,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087204
Microsphere embedded in cantilever opens the AFM to high resolution optical microscopy,"Summary form only given. The combination of the AFM technique and the sphere-mediated microscopy (SMM) [1] opens a new opportunity to the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). With the help of a tipless AFM cantilever is possible to place and scan a microspheres (MS) close to the surface. From the optical point of view, when a MS is close to a surface act as high NA nanolenses whose optical characteristics define the maximum attainable resolution.We performed a detailed measurement of the spatial resolution in SMM by imaging a calibration target made of gratings with different periodicity. Images of the test gratings with and without the microsphere allowed a full characterization of the spatial frequency response of our microscope (modulation transfer function or MTF) and the consequent quantitative determination of the enhancement in resolution induced by the microsphere[2].",Optical imaging;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Spatial resolution;Surface topography;Optical detectors,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087766
Second harmonic generation microscopy as a cancer diagnosis tool,"Summary form only given. Optical microscopy is one of the most important tool for understanding biology processes. Recently with the advance of femtosecond laser all the nonlinear optical processes have been included into optical microscopy methods and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy has emerged as a powerful new optical imaging tool with applications in disease diagnostics [ 1-2]. The ""gold standard"" in cancer diagnostics is still the traditional histology analysis where accuracy depends on the experience and interpretation skill of the pathologist. A major development would be to use the SHG microscopy as a quantitative tool to cancer diagnosis. Here we show SHG imaging results of the collagen fibers in prostate cancer tissue that can be directly correlated with the cancer malignancy diagnostic [3]. We performed SHG imaging in a back-scattering geometry on the histological slides from the same biopsies that were analyzed by the pathologist. We studied prostate from patients treated at the the Urology Center of UFMG Hospital, Belo Horizonte. A 1 mm diameter punch biopsy was extracted from multiple peripheral zone of the prostate showing normal tissue and cancer tissue with Gleason scores ranging from 3 to 5. The study was approved by the UFMG Institutional Review Board and the Brazilian National Health Committee on the use of humans as experimental subjects. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before their biopsy procedures. Figure 1 shows SHG images for normal and cancer tissue. The SHG images show major differences on the collagen fiber alignment that changes with cancer progression. The average direction of the fibers in the image was calculated and we obtained a value for the fiber anisotropy [4]. The statistical analysis is presented in the boxplot in figure 1. Note that both the average values (crosses) and the median lines (black center lines) are well separated for the normal and cancer tissue.In summary we present SHG measurements for prostate tissue that allows to obtain a quantitative analysis of the collagen fiber alignment. Our results suggest that this new method could be useful as a complementary tool on grading prostate cancer.

Advanced skin lesion discrimination pipeline for early melanoma cancer diagnosis towards PoC devices,The proposed work describes an effective pipeline for skin lesion (nevus) analysis with related oncological outcomes. The increasing statistics of skin cancer have recently contributed to the development of new methods for early detection and discrimination of malignant skin lesions in order to drastically reduce the number of biopsies often very invasive for the patients. The main aggressive skin cancer histology is the so-called “melanoma” with related differentiation. Several methods have been proposed in the literature for early melanoma detection but often they lack in sensibility/specificity for a real clinical use. The proposed pipeline is based on an effective approach employing analytic innovative hand-crafted image features combined with a machine learning system. This allows both early detection and discrimination of the skin lesions with good trade-off between sensibility/specificity ratio.,Lesions;Skin;Pipelines;Image segmentation;Malignant tumors;Neural networks;Cancer;melanoma;skin cancer;medical imaging;dermoscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD),10.1109/ECCTD.2017.8093310
Microscope image processing for TB diagnosis using shape features and ellipse fitting,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis or simply M. tuberculosis. It is primarily an infection of lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body such as brain, intestine, kidney and spine. TB remains one of the leading cause of death in developing countries, although most are preventable if diagnosed early and treated. Among the available tools, Sputum smear microscopy is the most widely used one for TB detection. It is done manually and is often time consuming; a laboratory technician is expected to spend at least 25 minutes per slide, limiting the number of slides that can be screened. Also any incorrect diagnosis will leads to serious health issues. So a solution is Automatic screening methods. Many attempts have been made to develop automatic approaches to identify TB bacteria from microscopic sputum smear images. In this paper, we present an automatic TB diagnosis technique using morphological features and ellipse fitting. Microscopic images of sputum smear are collected from infected subjects. These images are transformed into HSV color space for a better analysis, which is thresholded using hue range of red pink color. The resultant images will contain TB bacilli along with non-TB objects. In order to identify the TB regions from the non-TB regions, shape features of every identified region is evaluated. Finally a new algorithm that make use of concave contour points as well as ellipse fitting is performed to separate out the overlapping bacilli region and add them to the total count of bacilli.",Image color analysis;Shape;Microscopy;Microorganisms;Feature extraction;Fitting;Morphological operations;Tuberculosis(TB);Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN);HSV;Shape Feature analysis;Polygon approximation;Concave point extraction;Contour segmentation;Ellipse fitting,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Informatics, Communication and Energy Systems (SPICES)",10.1109/SPICES.2017.8091342
WSISA: Making Survival Prediction from Whole Slide Histopathological Images,"Image-based precision medicine techniques can be used to better treat cancer patients. However, the gigapixel resolution of Whole Slide Histopathological Images (WSIs) makes traditional survival models computationally impossible. These models usually adopt manually labeled discriminative patches from region of interests (ROIs) and are unable to directly learn discriminative patches from WSIs. We argue that only a small set of patches cannot fully represent the patients survival status due to the heterogeneity of tumor. Another challenge is that survival prediction usually comes with insufficient training patient samples. In this paper, we propose an effective Whole Slide Histopathological Images Survival Analysis framework (WSISA) to overcome above challenges. To exploit survival-discriminative patterns from WSIs, we first extract hundreds of patches from each WSI by adaptive sampling and then group these images into different clusters. Then we propose to train an aggregation model to make patient-level predictions based on cluster-level Deep Convolutional Survival (DeepConvSurv) prediction results. Different from existing state-of-the-arts image-based survival models which extract features using some patches from small regions of WSIs, the proposed framework can efficiently exploit and utilize all discriminative patterns in WSIs to predict patients survival status. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been shown before. We apply our method to the survival predictions of glioma and non-small-cell lung cancer using three datasets. Results demonstrate the proposed framework can significantly improve the prediction performance compared with the existing state-of-the-arts survival methods.",Tumors;Cancer;Computational modeling;Training;Feature extraction;Lungs,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),10.1109/CVPR.2017.725
Application of Evolutionary Algorithms on Unsupervised Segmentation of Lymphoma Histological Images,"Histological images analysis is widely used to carry out diagnoses of different types of cancer. Digital image processing methods can be used for this purpose, leading to more objective diagnoses. Segmentation techniques are applied to identify cellular structures indicative of diseases. In addition, the extracted features from these specific regions can aid pathologists in diagnoses decision using classification techniques. In this paper, we present an evaluation of evolutionary algorithms applied to lymphoma images for segmentation of their neoplastic cellular nuclei. In a second stage, we investigated the performance of the segmented images in the classification step. Initially, the R channel from RGB color model was processed with histogram equalization and Gaussian filter. In the segmentation step, optimization methods were analyzed in combination with the fuzzy 3-partition technique. Then, we also applied the valley-emphasis method and morphological operations to remove false positive regions in the post-processing step. Intensity and texture features were extracted and classified by the support vector machine method for diagnoses of 62 and 99 images of follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, respectively. The results were evaluated through qualitative and quantitative analyses and the differential evolution method has reached the best results in the segmentation step. This technique allowed a relevant performance on the classification task with a mean value of accuracy of 99.38%.",Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Evolutionary computation;Optimization methods;Support vector machines;nuclear segmentation;evolutionary algorithms;fuzzy 3-partition;lymphoma classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),10.1109/CBMS.2017.69

Malaria parasite detection using different machine learning classifier,"In the tropical and the subtropical countries, malaria has been a challenge, which really needs a quick and precise diagnosis to put a stop or control the disease. The conventional microscopy method has some shortcomings which includes time consumption and reproducibility. Many of the alternative methods are expensive and it's not readily accessible to the developing countries that need them. In this paper a fast and precise system was developed using stained blood smear images. We employed watershed segmentation technique to acquire plasmodium infected and non-infected erythrocytes and relevant feature was extracted.

Automated determination of Plasmodium region of interest on thin blood smear images,"The region of interest (RoI) has the most useful information in image processing since the targeted objects are covered in this area. By determining the precise position of RoI, a computer-based identification will be able to work more efficiently, to give a better contribution in system and to eliminate objects that may intrude overall process. In malaria disease, the existence of Plasmodium can be observed from patient's microscopic thin blood smear images. Having utilised the computer aided detection based on image processing, malaria disease can be detected earlier and more objective in order to support the final decision of paramedics. This study proposes a novel method to automatically determine the region of interest (RoI) on thin blood smear images for facilitating the process of Plasmodium parasite detection. The approach includes Otsu thresholding method, morphological operation and binary large object (BLOB) analysis. Evaluation results on 24 thin blood smear images show that the proposed method achieves the sensitivity and PPV rates of 87.5% and 75.7%, respectively. These successful results in automatically determine the RoI which contains the Plasmodium parasite indicate that the proposed method has a potential to be implemented in the development of a computer aided malaria detection system.",Diseases;Morphological operations;Microscopy;Red blood cells;Sensitivity;Information technology;plasmodium parasite;thin blood smear images;automated determination of region;binary large object analysis;morphological operation,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA),10.1109/ISITIA.2017.8124108
A comparison of platelets classification from digitalization microscopic peripheral blood smear,"Thrombocyte disease is usually caused by abnormalities, such as abnormalities based on the number and morphological deformities of platelets. Examples of platelet abnormalities include small platelets in Wiskottldrich syndrome, giant platelets in some chronic myeloproliferative diseases, Benard Soulier syndrome and Macrothrombocytopenia in gray platelet syndrome. The usual problem of automatic FBC analysis is that undetectable morphological abnormalities of platelets so the microscopic examination is required using peripheral blood smear. But microscopic examination also has some weakness such as subjective depend on medical analyst/pathologist. We propose an accurate method to classify plateles from digitalization microscopic peripheral blood smear using combination of second order statistic feature extraction and comparing several methods. The comparing methods are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). In this feature extraction, we use Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to get Angular Second Moment (ASM), Invers Different Moment (IDM) and entropi values. Those values will be inserted as input in KNN classifier method to classify blood cell in peripheral blood smear. Classify of cells based on feature extraction values is divided into three classes (leukocytes, normal platelets and giant platelets). Based on the result of experiments, both of methods can classify platelets on all color channels with average accuracy are 83.67% for KNN and 74.75% for LVQ. So, The KNN classification method is better able than LVQ to classify platelets in peripheral blood smear.",Image color analysis;Blood;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Diseases;Symmetric matrices;Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix;K-Nearest Neighbor;Learning Vector Quantization;Giant Platelets;Peripheral Blood Smear,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA),10.1109/ISITIA.2017.8124109
Automatic detection of acute myeloid leukemia from microscopic blood smear image,"Cancer of blood-forming tissues is called Leukemia. This disease hinders the body's ability to fight infection.

"Characteristics determination of infected erithrocytes by plasmodium falciparum as a diagnostic of malaria, based on microscopic images","A diagnosis of a stadium of Plasmodium can help physicians in managing patients with malaria. The stadium of Plasmodium is divided into three stadiums, namely trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte. Staging is based on the morphological characteristics of each stadium, including shape, size, texture, and color. We selected 15 features using a correlation-based feature selection method with a “best first” search algorithm. This system is created to identify the detected object, while the stadium will be determined based on the morphological characteristics of each object. Then, the application will provide information on how many each stadium can successfully identify. This diagnostic tool for malaria based on microscopic images, is intended to identify the characteristics of the stadium of Plasmodium in malaria and classified into trophozoit, schizont or gametocyte. The method used to classify the stadium is a support vector machine (SVM), whose strategy is “one versus all” (OVA), which yields an accuracy of 83.252%.

The main contribution of our work is the creation of a new shape descriptor in order to evaluate the irregularity of the cell nucleus. This index takes its values between 0 and 1, and picks the value of 0 if and only if the measured shape is regular (circle, square, rectangle, triangle and hexagon). After segmentation step, three features are selected: elongation, circularity and irregularity factors. These parameters are used as input for ANFIS classifier when a set of rules are generated. The proposed method was evaluated with a data set of 40 nucleus. We obtain an accuracy of 97.62% with 3K-cross validation method.",Shape;Indexes;Shape measurement;Feature extraction;Area measurement;Lesions;Microprocessors;Cell nucleus;feature extraction;Irregularity measure;ANFIS,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B),10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8191979
Automatic identification of circulating tumor cells in fluorescence microscopy images based on AdaBoost,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a useful biomarker for cancer metastasis. The blood from a cancer patient is analyzed by a fluorescence microscope. Each case takes a large number of images, which usually have a lot of cell regions. Thus, analyzing the images is hard work for pathologists, and misdiagnosis may happen. In this paper, we develop an automatic CTCs identification method for fluorescence microscopy images. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we extract cell regions in images using filtering methods. Second, we compute features of each CTC candidate regions. Finally, we identify the CTCs using AdaBoost algorithm. And we analyze the features to know which ones are effective for characterizing CTCs and normal cells. We apply the proposed method to 5040 microscopy images, and evaluate the effectiveness of our method by using leave-one-out cross validation. We achieve a true positive rate of 97.30 [%] and a false positive rate of 12.82 [%].",Principal component analysis;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Blood;Cancer;Tumors;Circulating tumor cells;Identification of CTCs;Computer aided diagnosis;Feature analysis;AdaBoost,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)",10.23919/ICCAS.2017.8204219
Classification of breast tumors as benign and malignant using textural feature descriptor,"In this paper we have presented an automated diagnosis of breast cell cancer using histopathological images on the basis of different textural descriptors.

Classifying breast cancer microscopic images using fractal dimension and ensemble classifier,"To improve the performance of the computer-aided systems for breast cancer diagnosis, the ensemble classifier is proposed for classifying the histological structures in the breast cancer microscopic images into three region types: positive cancer cells, negative cancer cells and non-cancer cell (stromal cells and lymphocyte cells) image. The bagging and boosting ensemble techniques are used with the decision tree (DT) learner. They are also compared with the single classifier, DT. The feature used as an input of classifiers is the fractal dimension (FD) based 12 color channels. It is computed from the image datasets, which are manually prepared in small cropped image with 3 window sizes including 128×128 pixels, 192×192 pixels and 256×256 pixels. The results show that the boosting ensemble classifier gives the best accuracy about 80% from window size of 256, although it is the lowest when using the single DT as classifier. The results indicated that the ensemble method is capable of improving the accuracy in the classification compared to the single classifier. The classification model using FD and the ensemble classifier would be applied to develop the computer-aided systems for breast cancer diagnosis in the future.",Image color analysis;Boosting;Fractals;Bagging;Breast cancer;Bagging;boosting;decision tree;image pattern recognition;feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 10th Biomedical Engineering International Conference (BMEiCON),10.1109/BMEiCON.2017.8229111
Computer-aided classification of breast cancer histopathological images,"Nowadays, one of the most common types of cancer is breast cancer. The early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer has great importance in the treatment of the disease. In the diagnosis of breast cancer, histopathological analysis of cell and tissue specimens taken by biopsy is considered as the gold standard. Histopathological analysis is a tedious process that is highly dependent on the knowledge and experience of the pathologists. In this study; it is aimed to develop a computer-aided system that can reduce the workload of pathologists and help them in their diagnosis. An image set containing benign and malignant tumor images of breast cancer has been studied. To perform texture analysis on tumor images; first order statistics, Gabor and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature extraction methods have been applied. Then, various classifiers were applied to the obtained feature matrices and their performances were compared. The highest classification accuracy was achieved 82.06% by Random Forests classifier with feature combination of Gabor and GLCM methods.

P2D-10 Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Peripheral Soft Tissue Tumors Using Geometric and Texture Features,"In recent years, researchers have investigated different methods for the differentiation of benign and malignant tumors. It, however, is still very limited for the peripheral soft tissue tumors, due to the rare occurrence and large variation of the characteristics. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system makes tremendous progress in the studies of ultrasound images, so it can provide a stable and reliable diagnostic modality in clinic. In our experiment, we studied 49 patients with peripheral soft tissue tumors and verified them with histopathology examination. All patients were examined by the same ultrasound system and linear transducer. Before quantifying analysis, tumor contours are segmented by an active contour model. Following, we retrieve geometric and texture features from ultrasound images to develop a CAD algorithm. Linear discriminant analysis (LAD) with leave-one-out cross-validation is used in the analysis. Both the geometric and texture features are performed the results with p-value < 0.01.

Multilayer antireflection coatings for Ge optical window,"Two multilayer antireflection coatings have been designed, prepared and characterized for a 1 mm thick Ge optical window in 3.25-5.25 mu band for optical and electro-optical application. Ta2O5 and TiO2 have been used as high index materials along with SiO2 as low index material. The prepared multilayer structures have been characterized optically and structurally using spectrophotometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Post deposition annealing of both multilayer structures have been carried out in the temperature range of 150-450degC for 10 hours, to study the effects of annealing on structure and transmission characteristics of the two configurations. Optical analysis shows that multilayer structure exhibits high absorption for the as-deposited samples which improves with subsequent annealing for both configurations. Structural realignment has been observed as soon as post deposition annealing is started and the film structure fails at annealing temperature of 450degC for both configurations, before the realignment process could complete. Configuration 1 has shown predominantly amorphous like structure, where as configuration 2 exhibited pronounced peaks with crystalline structure. A considerable improvement in the transmission profiles for the two multilayer configurations has been observed with highest transmission observed at 350degC with peak and average transmission for the both configurations has been found exceeding 90%. However, at 450degC, delamination and cracking of the two multilayer structures have been witnessed and its reasons have been studied.",Nonhomogeneous media;Coatings;Optical films;Annealing;Atom optics;Atomic force microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy;Optical materials;Electron optics;Optical microscopy;Multilayers;antireflection coatings,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,2006 IEEE International Multitopic Conference,10.1109/INMIC.2006.358214
Influence of Layers Morphology on the Sensitivity of SnO2-based Optical Fiber Sensors,"Recently, the capability of a SnO2 based silica optical fiber (SOF) sensors to detect ammonia at room temperature in water environment has been for the first time demonstrated [1-3]. The SOF probes were deposited onto the fiber end by the simple and low cost Electrostatic Spray Pyrolysis technique (ESP), which allows to change the layers features by changing the deposition parameters. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that modifications of the optical near field behavior occur when the sensitive overlay exhibits peaks with dimensions comparable with the light wavelength (1.55 mum). In addition, the influence of the SnO2 layers morphology on the room temperature sensing performances against ammonia, in water environment, is preliminarily investigated. To the aim, before performing the ammonia adsorption measurements, the topography and the optical near field profile for different SnO2-based sensors have been analyzed by a very complex instrumentation able to perform simultaneous atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) imaging.",Morphology;Optical fiber sensors;Optical sensors;Optical microscopy;Temperature sensors;Atom optics;Atomic force microscopy;Performance evaluation;Atomic measurements;Force measurement,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,"SENSORS, 2006 IEEE",10.1109/ICSENS.2007.355601
Automated Cell Nuclei Segmentation and Classification of Squamous Cell Carcinoma from Microscopic Images of Esophagus Tissue,"The task of segmenting cell nuclei in microscopic images is a classical image analysis problem. The accurate nuclei segmentation may contribute to development of successful system which automates the analysis of microscope images for pathology detection. The major features of malignancy are related with the nuclei of the cells. It is therefore essential to operate a segmentation of the image, to isolate the nuclei from the rest of the image that is from the cytoplasm, and from some other undesirable elements coming from the image preparation. In this paper, we have proposed an automated cell nuclei segmentation and classification of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) from microscopic images of esophagus tissue using moment based textural features. The morphological operations are used to remove the squaring effect on the boundary of nuclei. The proposed method is applied on color microscopic images in RGB color space. The experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently segment cell nuclei and classify squamous cell carcinoma from the microscopic images.

Detecting Prostatic Adenocarcinoma From Digitized Histology Using a Multi-Scale Hierarchical Classification Approach,In this paper we present a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to automatically detect prostatic adenocarcinoma from high resolution digital histopathological slides. This is especially desirable considering the large number of tissue slides that are currently analyzed manually - a laborious and time-consuming task. Our methodology is novel in that texture-based classification is performed using a hierarchical classifier within a multi-scale framework. Pyramidal decomposition is used to reduce an image into its constituent scales. The cascaded image analysis across multiple scales is similar to the manner in which pathologists analyze histopathology. Nearly 600 different image texture features at multiple orientations are extracted at every pixel at each image scale. At each image scale the classifier only analyzes those image pixels that have been determined to be tumor at the preceding lower scale. Results of quantitative evaluation on 20 patient studies indicate (1) an overall accuracy of over 90% and (2) an approximate 8-fold savings in terms of computational time. Both the AdaBoost and decision tree classifiers were considered and in both cases tumor detection sensitivity was found to be relatively constant across different scales. Detection specificity was however found to increase at higher scales reflecting the availability of additional discriminatory information,Classification tree analysis;Image texture analysis;Image analysis;Decision trees;Prostate cancer;USA Councils;Pixel;Cancer detection;Feature extraction;Computer aided diagnosis;Hierarchical classifier;decision trees;AdaBoost;prostate cancer;digitized histology,INPROCEEDINGS,2006,2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260188

Study of Melanocytic Nevi using image processing,"Melanocytic nevi are benign pigmented skin lesions associated with increased risk of transforming into malignant lesions. Most of the malignant lesions are misclassified as Clark Nevi based on the dermoscopic criteria. Histopathological analysis forms a gold standard. However, this leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Thus the identification of benign lesion from malignant lesions plays a prominent role in diagnosis of melanoma. Although significant progress has been made in developing automated diagnostic tools, there exists a need for developing reliable non-invasive diagnostic tools. This can be achieved by incorporating the detection of dermoscopic features based on their histopathological relevance. This study uniquely provides the histopathological correlations of dermoscopic features to facilitate reliable non-invasive diagnosis. The relevance of the dermoscopic features are provided. It is inferred that shape, color and dermoscopic features such as blue-white veil and pigment network would contribute significantly to the field of melanoma diagnosis.",Lesions;Malignant tumors;Cancer;Pigments;Image color analysis;Epidermis;Dermoscopy;Histopathology;Melanoma;Melanocytic Nevi;Pigmented Skin Lesions,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 2nd IEEE International Conference on Recent Trends in Electronics, Information & Communication Technology (RTEICT)",10.1109/RTEICT.2017.8256618

Localizing and Recognizing Labels for Multi-Panel Figures in Biomedical Journals,"Multi-panel figures are common in biomedical journals. Often the subpanels are of different types, e.g. x-ray, microscopy, sketch, etc. Visual information retrieval of such figures can significantly benefit from Panel Label Recognition techniques that index figures for search engines, image content tagging, and correlating with figure (sub)captions. It is a challenging task due to large variation in the label locations, sizes, contrast to background, etc. In this work, we propose a 3-stage recognition algorithm. The first stage is formulated as object detection, where we extract Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features and train a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Label candidates are detected using sliding windows at different locations and scales. We also trained a convolutional deep neural network (CNN) to remove false positives. The second stage is formulated as image classification. We trained a 50-class RBF SVM classifier and estimate the posterior probabilities of each candidate label. The last stage is formulated as sequence classification. We used a beam search algorithm on the posterior probabilities estimated in the second stage along with a set of label sequence constraints to select an optimal label sequence.

Modeling structural dissimilarity based on shape embodiment for cell segmentation,"Accurate cell segmentation is one of the critical, yet challenging problems in microscopy images due to ambiguous boundaries as well as a wide variation of shapes and sizes of cells. Even though a number of existing methods have achieved decent results for cell segmentation, boundary vagueness between adjoining cells tended to cause generation of perceptually inaccurate segmentation of stained nuclei. We propose a segmentation method of cells based on structural dissimilarity between embodied and imaged cells. From assumption that the shape of the region of adjoining cells follows a 2D Gaussian mixture model, the cell region is divided by an expectation-maximization method. The lowest structural dissimilarity using embodied cells decides on the number of components of the 2D Gaussian mixture model. The region of interest is extracted by implementation of both global and local thresholdings, which performs binarization of the local image with a seed at the center, where the seed is obtained by the maximally stable extremal regions. Our approach presented considerably higher evaluation scores compared with other five existing methods in terms of both accuracies of region of interest (ROI) detection and boundary discrimination.",Image segmentation;Shape;Gaussian mixture model;Microscopy;Two dimensional displays;Sensitivity;Cell segmentation;cell division;embodied cell;Gaussian mixture model;ROI detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2017.8297002

Interactive exploration of microstructural features in gigapixel microscopy images,"Modern imaging technologies enable the study of microstructural features, which require capturing the finest details in high-resolution gigapixel images. Nevertheless, the resolution disparity between gigapixel images and megapixel displays presents a challenge to effective visual analysis because subtle texture differences are hardly perceivable at coarser resolutions. In this paper, we present a hierarchical segmentation technique based on the joint distribution of intensity and noise-resistant local binary patterns to differentiate subtle microstructural textures across various scales. The coarse-to-fine segmentation procedure subdivides each parent segment into texturally-distinct child segments at progressively higher resolutions.

Image analysis for malaria parasite detection from microscopic images of thick blood smear,"Malaria is a major health issue and causes millions of deaths a year worldwide. Since the diagnosis of malaria is predominately done using light microscopy method, well-trained microscopists are required. By using thick blood smear, a large amount of blood can be examined quickly and easily. This work deals with the automatic estimation of parasite density in `parasites per microliter of blood' from the microscopic images of Giemsa-stained thick blood smear. The algorithm is primarily divided into three steps: (1) preprocessing & segmentation, (2) feature extraction and (3) classification. In the preprocessing step, an attempt is made to reduce variations due to various factors like lighting conditions and concentration of staining solution. The image is segmented using adaptive thresholding, followed by several mathematical morphological operations. In the second step, various features based on shape, texture, color and frequency domain are extracted. Using the classification step, the parasite candidate is classified into its correct life stage or classified as leukocytes. The novelty of the algorithm is that it can detect all the life stages (ring, trophozoite, schizont, gametocyte) of parasites and leukocytes unlike detecting only ring life stage in the state-of-the-art algorithms. The discrepancy in the automated parasite count by the proposed algorithm is 7.14%, which is suitable for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of malaria according to world health organization (WHO) quality control standards.",Blood;Feature extraction;Diseases;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Histograms;Training;Medical Image Analysis;Malaria;Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD);Thick Blood Film,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Signal Processing and Networking (WiSPNET)",10.1109/WiSPNET.2017.8299974
Medical image mosaic based on low-overlapping regions,"This paper focuses on the mosaicing of microscopic medical images. Different from regular application scene where the source images usually have an overlapping ratio between 30%~50%, source images in this paper have a rather low overlapping ratio less than 15%. Performances of several generic feature-based registration methods are compared in order to explore which one is most appropriate for our application. This paper presents a novel mosaic algorithm as follows. Firstly, Speeded-up Robust Feature (SURF) points in the regions surrounding the overlapped are extracted and then roughly matching results of feature points are acquired. Secondly, mismatched pairs are eliminated according to spatial distance of matching points, and then geometrical relationship between reference image and target image is determined. Finally, registered images are blended into a composite image with modified weighted smooth algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to create a visually pleasant panoramic image.",Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Robustness;Image fusion;Image edge detection;Image registration;Brightness;image mosaic;SURF;feature matching;matching refining;image fusion,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 10th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)",10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8302067
Colour image segmentation for malaria parasites detection using cascading method,"Malaria disease is one of the deadliest diseases. According to WHO report, in 2016, there were 212 million malaria cases with 429,000 estimated deaths around the world. Rapid and accurate detection of malarial infection could certainly help in reducing the above numbers. This paper focuses on segmentation and detection of microscopy images infected with malaria parasites using the colour-based cascading method. The method begins with colour normalization process, followed by gamma correction, then noise reduction, exposure compensation, edge enhancement, fuzzy c-means clustering, and lastly, morphological processes. We used the method to detect malaria infection for four Plasmodium types and three malaria development phases in 574 images. The experimental results demonstrated that the method achieved 97.91%, 98.61%, and 98.26% for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. These results suggest that the proposed method can detect malaria in microscopy images robustly.",Hafnium;Hidden Markov models;malaria;Plasmodium;cascading method;detection;image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 International Conference on Sustainable Information Engineering and Technology (SIET),10.1109/SIET.2017.8304114

In this work, we investigate applying the Faster R-CNN, which has recently shown incredible performance on many public datasets, to cell detection. The Faster R-CNN contains both segmentation and classification. By training a Faster R-CNN model, a series of experiments are achieved.

In this approach, recently developed soft computing procedure known as the Social Group Optimization (SGO) and the entropy function is chosen to mine the Region Of Interest (ROI) from Giemsa stained digital images. In this work, extraction of the blood cell region and the plasmodium species is chosen as the problem. Proposed experimental work is implemented using MATLAB. A relative analysis is presented between the entropy functions, like Kapur and Tsallis. The performance of the Kapur/Tsallis functions is assessed using well known image quality measures and the shape measured based on the GLCM.

Development of automatic identification and classification system for malaria parasite in thin blood smears based on morphological techniques,"This paper investigates the possibility of rapid and accurate automated diagnosis of red blood cell disorders and describes a method to detect and classify malarial parasites in blood sample images acquired from light microscopes. Malaria is an infectious disease and is mainly diagnosed by microscopical evaluation of Giemsa stained blood smears. Since it causes a serious health problem, automation of the evaluation process is of high importance. The image classification system is designed to positively identify malaria parasite in thin blood smears.

Colon Cancer Detection in Biopsy Images for Indian Population at Different Magnification Factors Using Texture Features,"This paper presents the identification of colon histology images as normal and malicious ones for the determination of colon cancer. Such classification is very difficult as it takes into account numerous characteristics such as color, several biological interpretable factors. Also this process is subjective and may have some observational variations. In this paper the colon biopsy images are classified as normal and malicious ones based on the texture of the images for the Indian population. Various texture features such as GLCM, LBP, HOG, Gabor, GLRLM, Histogram are extracted from the images with different magnification factors such as 10X, 20X and 40X. Based on these features extracted at different magnification factor, they are trained using classifiers SVM with linear kernel, Naive Bayes and Perceptron.

The dental images were firstly pre-processed to decrease the impact of imbalance local illumination. Secondly, a robust feature points extraction strategy was investigated and proposed, i.e. the boundary of hard tissue and lesion areas were calculated as feature point sets.

Evaluation of State of the Art Methods for Segmenting Muscle Cells,"Segmentation of muscle cells is important and challenging in microscopy imaging applications. There are many segmentation algorithms available in the literature and they depend on different image features such as pixel intensity value, color and textures. In this paper, three state of the art image segmentation methods: Slope Difference Thresholding and Iterative Erosion based method(SDAIE), SMASH method and CellSegm method were evaluated and compared. To compare the performance of the algorithms and assist the users to understand each method better, different types of muscle cell images and six segmentation evaluation metrics were used.

Prediction of Isolated Erythrocytes Formation from Compound Erythrocytes in Blood Cells Images,"In biomedical field, microscopic blood samples plays very important role to determine the blood related diseases. These blood samples contain various components such as erythrocytes, which is used to predict the blood disorders. For this prediction, there is a need of total count of isolated and compound erythrocytes. To calculate the total erythrocytes, manual process is not reliable and it is a time consuming and tedious process. Therefore, there is a need of automatic system for calculating the erythrocytes count. This paper proposes the image processing based solution for the abovementioned problem. The proposed framework gives the total count of isolated and compound erythrocytes for given input microscopic blood sample, as well as predicts the total number of isolated cells can be formed from compound erythrocytes. This system makes use of area, compactness and aspect ratio features along with KNN classifier to improve the accuracy of isolated and compound erythrocytes count calculation. Performance of the system is evaluated on CDCP dataset, and prove that system accurately predict the number of isolated erythrocytes can be formed from compound erythrocytes.",Blood;Compounds;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Cells (biology);Image processing;microscopic blood sample images;erythrocytes;counting;KNN,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication, Control and Automation (ICCUBEA)",10.1109/ICCUBEA.2017.8463823
Neonatal Blood Analysis and Generating Disorder Estimation Using Image Processing,"The analysis of blood cells in microscopic images can provide useful information concerning the health of patients; however, manual classification of blood cells is time-consuming. Classification is susceptible to error due to the different morphological features of the cells. Therefore, a fast and automated method for identifying the different shape of blood cells is required. Neonatal blood cell diseases have grown in a large amount in the recent past. Acute pneumonia, leukemia and anemia being some of such diseases, they do have an impact on the blood cell size and its properties. Such diseases tend to change the size and shape of the RBCs, WBCs and Platelet, and also sometimes leading to change in their gross counts. The propose system help to work for analysis the changes by shape analysis & size detection of blood cell using image processing. The image is converted to gray scale image from further processing. The use of image processing discards the need of the expert pathologists as well as reduces the volume of blood required to be withdrawn from the neonatal baby. A novel shape detection base algorithm will be developed which can classify the neonatal diseases depending upon morphological changes in the blood cells. Also, this algorithm causes the reduction of noise in the final image that might completely discards the possibility of error, leading to accurate detection of blood cell problems.",Cells (biology);Shape;Blood platelets;Diseases;Image edge detection;Pediatrics;Microscopic Images;classification;image processing;shape detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication, Control and Automation (ICCUBEA)",10.1109/ICCUBEA.2017.8463913
Aluminium Oxide (Al2O3) Nanopore Image Analysis Using Digital Image Processing Techniques,"Automated microscopic image analysis serves as an efficient tool in biological studies and modern material science for qualitative analysis.

The geometrical and statistical features are used to measure the variance of nanopore size depending on the anodization properties; namely, concentration (%), time (min), temperature (°C) and voltage (V). The observations depict that the nanopore shape and size is enhanced with escalating anodization time (min) with constant concentration (%), temperature (°C) and voltage (V). It is also been revealed that, the rise in anodization time results to decline in wall thickness from 58-41nm and augment in nanopore diameter size and porosity from 32-78 nm and 0.234 to 2.034, respectively.

Breast Epithelial Duct Region Segmentation Using Intuitionistic Fuzzy Based Multi-Texture Image Map,"Currently histology breast cancer tissue interpretation through microscope is a manual procedure. Inter-intra-observer variability in breast cancer diagnosis by expert pathologist can be improved by minimizing it through automatic objective analysis. To achieve this purpose, an Atanassov's Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (AIFS) based multi-texture image clustering technique is proposed in this paper to segment duct epithelial arrangement present in the breast biopsy images. Main contribution of this paper includes development of an AIFS color texture map to capture breast duct region from digitized histology images. Further, this multi-feature texture image representation is used to formulate new AIFS affinity matrix. Normalized cuts (NCUT) method using this new affinity matrix automatically segments duct epithelium nuclear arrangement. The algorithm is applied on digitized Non-Malignant (NM) and Malignant (M) breast biopsy tissue images to automatically detect epithelial nuclear region and is evaluated quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The algorithm segments epithelial duct from the breast histology images at average segmentation accuracy of 88.54% and 77.05% respectively.

Feature-Based Non-rigid Registration of Serial Section Images by Blending Rigid Transformations,"In this paper, we describe feature-based nonrigid registration of histological serial section images. Our method represents non-rigid deformation by blending the rigid transformations estimated in the local region around a control point. This approach can efficiently represent nonrigid deformation with a smaller number of control points than conventional methods that interpolate displacement, such as free-form deformation (FFD). A feature-based approach is adopted to extract the control points and robustly estimate the local rigid transformation at each control point. By blending the rigid transformations, the displacement at each pixel is computed as a transformation field. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for achieving non-rigid registration efficiently and robustly for histological serial section images.",Strain;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Image resolution;Transforms;Computer graphics;Quaternions;Image registration;Non-rigid deformation;Blending of transformation,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 4th IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR),10.1109/ACPR.2017.107
Performance Analysis of Image Segmentation for Oral Tissue,"Digital image segmentation is the first step in computer aided diagnostic procedures which are carried out with the help of medical images in the medical field. In this paper, segmentation of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained microscopic image of stratified squamous epithelial layer of oral cavity to separate the squamous cells from the background is performed by different approaches. Due to the complex structure of the squamous epithelial layer, the widely used K-means clustering and thresholding techniques are either not suitable for segmenting such images or unable to furnishthe suitable result. In this work, we are proposing new method for segmentation using Gabor filter. The input image is filtered through a bank of Gabor filters. The number of scales used in constructing the bank of filters is adaptive and automatically computed based on the size of the image. Filtered outputs are taken as 2-dimentional feature vectors. Furthermore, principal component analysis is performed to reduce the dimensionality. In addition, the first principal component is used as the feature image for further processing towards segmentation. This feature image is given as input to both the K-means clustering and thresholding for the final segmentation. The outputs of different approaches are compared. It is found that Gabor filter with thresholding and K-means clustering offers improved result as compared to the conventional ones.",Image segmentation;Gabor filters;Microscopy;Filter banks;Thresholding (Imaging);Image color analysis;Principal component analysis;Image Segmentation;Gabor filter;K-means clustering;Oral cavity;PCA,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 Ninth International Conference on Advances in Pattern Recognition (ICAPR),10.1109/ICAPR.2017.8593139

Applying Faster R-CNN for Object Detection on Malaria Images,"Deep learning based models have had great success in object detection, but the state of the art models have not yet been widely applied to biological image data. We apply for the first time an object detection model previously used on natural images to identify cells and recognize their stages in brightfield microscopy images of malaria-infected blood. Many micro-organisms like malaria parasites are still studied by expert manual inspection and hand counting. This type of object detection task is challenging due to factors like variations in cell shape, density, and color, and uncertainty of some cell classes. In addition, annotated data useful for training is scarce, and the class distribution is inherently highly imbalanced due to the dominance of uninfected red blood cells. We use Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), one of the top performing object detection models in recent years, pre-trained on ImageNet but fine tuned with our data, and compare it to a baseline, which is based on a traditional approach consisting of cell segmentation, extraction of several single-cell features, and classification using random forests. To conduct our initial study, we collect and label a dataset of 1300 fields of view consisting of around 100,000 individual cells. We demonstrate that Faster R-CNN outperforms our baseline and put the results in context of human performance.",Training;Diseases;Object detection;Machine learning;Image segmentation;Computer architecture;Blood,INPROCEEDINGS,2017,2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW),10.1109/CVPRW.2017.112
Region Growing for Segmenting Green Microalgae Images,"We describe a specialized methodology for segmenting 2D microscopy digital images of freshwater green microalgae. The goal is to obtain representative algae shapes to extract morphological features to be employed in a posterior step of taxonomical classification of the species. The proposed methodology relies on the seeded region growing principle and on a fine-tuned filtering preprocessing stage to smooth the input image. A contrast enhancement process then takes place to highlight algae regions on a binary pre-segmentation image. This binary image is also employed to determine where to place the seed points and to estimate the statistical probability distributions that characterize the target regions, i.e., the algae areas and the background, respectively. These preliminary stages produce the required information to set the homogeneity criterion for region growing. We evaluate the proposed methodology by comparing its resulting segmentations with a set of corresponding ground-truth segmentations (provided by an expert biologist) and also with segmentations obtained with existing strategies. The experimental results show that our solution achieves highly accurate segmentation rates with greater efficiency, as compared with the performance of standard segmentation approaches and with an alternative previous solution, based on level-sets, also specialized to handle this particular problem.",Image segmentation;Algae;Image edge detection;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Strain;Seeded region growing;freshwater green microalgae;image segmentation;Gaussian distribution,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2016.2615606
Contour Primitives of Interest Extraction Method for Microscopic Images and Its Application on Pose Measurement,"This paper proposes a suite of methods to realize high precision pose measurement in 3-D Cartesian space based on a multicamera microscopic vision system. Since it is inefficient to develop a specific image algorithm for each kind of object and the imaging condition might be unsatisfactory, we propose a method of contour primitives of interest extraction, which allows flexible reconfiguration for novel object image and owns robustness under different imaging conditions. The object is detected in grayscale image based on a template of contour primitives. Edges are extracted according to derivatives along the normal vectors of these contour primitives. The positions and directional derivatives of these edges are used for feature extraction and autofocus, respectively. The point features and line features extracted from multiview images are utilized to measure 3-D vectors and orientations, respectively, based on image Jacobian matrices. Cameras' linear motions are considered in the imaging model, so that the measurement range is expanded beyond the limitation of microscopes' shallow depths of field. The affine epipolar constraint and focused planes intersection constraint between cameras are applied to improve the real time performances of image feature extraction and multicamera autofocus, respectively. A series of experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

An Organelle Correlation-Guided Feature Selection Approach for Classifying Multi-Label Subcellular Bio-Images,"Nowadays, with the advances in microscopic imaging, accurate classification of bioimage-based protein subcellular location pattern has attracted as much attention as ever. One of the basic challenging problems is how to select the useful feature components among thousands of potential features to describe the images. This is not an easy task especially considering there is a high ratio of multi-location proteins. Existing feature selection methods seldom take the correlation among different cellular compartments into consideration, and thus may miss some features that will be co-important for several subcellular locations. To deal with this problem, we make use of the important structural correlation among different cellular compartments and propose an organelle structural correlation regularized feature selection method CSF (Common-Sets of Features) in this paper. We formulate the multi-label classification problem by adopting a group-sparsity regularizer to select common subsets of relevant features from different cellular compartments. In addition, we also add a cell structural correlation regularized Laplacian term, which utilizes the prior biological structural information to capture the intrinsic dependency among different cellular compartments. The CSF provides a new feature selection strategy for multi-label bio-image subcellular pattern classifications, and the experimental results also show its superiority when comparing with several existing algorithms.",Proteins;Feature extraction;Correlation;DNA;Databases;Computational biology;Bioimage processing;subcellular location classification;biological structure;multi-label;sparsity,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2017.2677907
AIIMDs: An Integrated Framework of Automatic Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy Diagnosis for Muscle,"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) is a common skeletal muscle disease that relates to weakness and inflammation of muscle. Early diagnosis and prognosis of different types of IIMs will guide the effective treatment. Interpretation of digitized images of the cross-section muscle biopsy, which is currently done manually, provides the most reliable diagnostic information. With the increasing volume of images, the management and manual interpretation of the digitized muscle images suffer from low efficiency and high interobserver variabilities. In order to address these problems, we propose the first complete framework of automatic IIM diagnosis system for the management and interpretation of digitized skeletal muscle histopathology images. The proposed framework consists of several key components: (1) Automatic cell segmentation, perimysium annotation, and nuclei detection; (2) histogram-based feature extraction and quantification; (3) content-based image retrieval to search and retrieve similar cases in the database for comparative study; and (4) majority voting-based classification to provide decision support for computer-aided clinical diagnosis. Experiments show that the proposed diagnosis system provides efficient and robust interpretation of the digitized muscle image and computer-aided diagnosis of IIM.",Muscles;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Microprocessors;Computer architecture;Diseases;Histograms;Computer-aided diagnostic system;microscopic images;muscle;myopathies,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2017.2694344
Nucleus Segmentation Using Gaussian Mixture based Shape Models,"We identify cells in microscopy images with stained nuclei, using the following process: Candidate seeds for nuclei are identified as extrema in a Laplacian-of-Gaussian space, and weak candidates are eliminated from clusters obtained by ellipse fitting; a region of interest for each nucleus is then defined by combining local and global thresholding; and these regions are repeatedly merged and split by modeling the shape of a nucleus and measuring the roughness of the shared boundaries connected nuclei. This method showed superior abilities to detect the nucleus regions and to split the boundaries of connected nuclei.

SparseLeap: Efficient Empty Space Skipping for Large-Scale Volume Rendering,"Recent advances in data acquisition produce volume data of very high resolution and large size, such as terabyte-sized microscopy volumes. These data often contain many fine and intricate structures, which pose huge challenges for volume rendering, and make it particularly important to efficiently skip empty space. This paper addresses two major challenges: (1) The complexity of large volumes containing fine structures often leads to highly fragmented space subdivisions that make empty regions hard to skip efficiently. (2) The classification of space into empty and non-empty regions changes frequently, because the user or the evaluation of an interactive query activate a different set of objects, which makes it unfeasible to pre-compute a well-adapted space subdivision. We describe the novel SparseLeap method for efficient empty space skipping in very large volumes, even around fine structures. The main performance characteristic of SparseLeap is that it moves the major cost of empty space skipping out of the ray-casting stage. We achieve this via a hybrid strategy that balances the computational load between determining empty ray segments in a rasterization (object-order) stage, and sampling non-empty volume data in the ray-casting (image-order) stage. Before ray-casting, we exploit the fast hardware rasterization of GPUs to create a ray segment list for each pixel, which identifies non-empty regions along the ray. The ray-casting stage then leaps over empty space without hierarchy traversal. Ray segment lists are created by rasterizing a set of fine-grained, view-independent bounding boxes.

SDL: Saliency-Based Dictionary Learning Framework for Image Similarity,"In image classification, obtaining adequate data to learn a robust classifier has often proven to be difficult in several scenarios. Classification of histological tissue images for health care analysis is a notable application in this context due to the necessity of surgery, biopsy or autopsy. To adequately exploit limited training data in classification, we propose a saliency guided dictionary learning method and subsequently an image similarity technique for histo-pathological image classification. Salient object detection from images aids in the identification of discriminative image features. We leverage the saliency values for the local image regions to learn a dictionary and respective sparse codes for an image, such that the more salient features are reconstructed with smaller error. The dictionary learned from an image gives a compact representation of the image itself and is capable of representing images with similar content, with comparable sparse codes. We employ this idea to design a similarity measure between a pair of images, where local image features of one image, are encoded with the dictionary learned from the other and vice versa. To effectively utilize the learned dictionary, we take into account the contribution of each dictionary atom in the sparse codes to generate a global image representation for image comparison. The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated using three tissue data sets that consist of mammalian kidney, lung and spleen tissue, breast cancer, and colon cancer tissue images. From the experiments, we observe that our methods outperform the state of the art with an increase of 14.2% in the average classification accuracy over all data sets.",Dictionaries;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Object detection;Image segmentation;Image coding;Algorithm design and analysis;Saliency;dictionary learning;sparse representation;image similarity;tissue image classification,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2017.2763829
Automated Cell Segmentation for Quantitative Phase Microscopy,"Automated cell segmentation and tracking is essential for dynamic studies of cellular morphology, movement, and interactions as well as other cellular behaviors. However, accurate, automated, and easy-to-use cell segmentation remains a challenge, especially in cases of high cell densities, where discrete boundaries are not easily discernable. Here, we present a fully automated segmentation algorithm that iteratively segments cells based on the observed distribution of optical cell volumes measured by quantitative phase microscopy. By fitting these distributions to known probability density functions, we are able to converge on volumetric thresholds that enable valid segmentation cuts. Since each threshold is determined from the observed data itself, virtually no input is needed from the user. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach over time using six cell types that display a range of morphologies, and evaluate these cultures over a range of confluencies. Facile dynamic measures of cell mobility and function revealed unique cellular behaviors that relate to tissue origins, state of differentiation, and real-time signaling. These will improve our understanding of multicellular communication and organization.",Microscopy;Optical imaging;Image segmentation;Adaptive optics;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical microscopy;Optical sensors;Cell segmentation;iterative thresholding;quantitative phase microscopy;optical volume;volumetric distribution,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2017.2775604
Adversarial Stain Transfer for Histopathology Image Analysis,"It is generally recognized that color information is central to the automatic and visual analysis of histopathology tissue slides. In practice, pathologists rely on color, which reflects the presence of specific tissue components, to establish a diagnosis. Similarly, automatic histopathology image analysis algorithms rely on color or intensity measures to extract tissue features. With the increasing access to digitized histopathology images, color variation and its implications have become a critical issue. These variations are the result of not only a variety of factors involved in the preparation of tissue slides but also in the digitization process itself. Consequently, different strategies have been proposed to alleviate stain-related tissue inconsistencies in automatic image analysis systems. Such techniques generally rely on collecting color statistics to perform color matching across images. In this work, we propose a different approach for stain normalization that we refer to as stain transfer. We design a discriminative image analysis model equipped with a stain normalization component that transfers stains across datasets. Our model comprises a generative network that learns data set-specific staining properties and image-specific color transformations as well as a task-specific network (e.g., classifier or segmentation network). The model is trained end-to-end using a multi-objective cost function. We evaluate the proposed approach in the context of automatic histopathology image analysis on three data sets and two different analysis tasks: tissue segmentation and classification. The proposed method achieves superior results in terms of accuracy and quality of normalized images compared to various baselines.",Image color analysis;Image analysis;Cancer;Image segmentation;Analytical models;Gray-scale;Histopathology;stain normalization;generative learning;adversarial training,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2017.2781228
Image Processing and Analysis of Phase-Contrast Microscopic Images of Activated Sludge to Monitor the Wastewater Treatment Plants,"Image processing and analysis is useful to monitor the activated sludge (AS) wastewater treatment plants based on the morphology of microbial aggregates (flocs) and filamentous bacteria. Phasecontrast microscopy is used to observe filamentous bacteria in the AS samples at lower objective magnification with improved visibility of details. However, segmentation of the phase-contrast images faces inherent difficulties caused by the artifacts associated with the microscopy, such as halos and shade-off. This paper is comprised mainly of three tasks: robust segmentation of phase-contrast images for filamentous bacteria, identification of novel image analysis parameters for morphology of the bacteria, and the use of the proposed parameters to model sludge volume index (SVI). SVI is the most important physical measurement employed to monitor the operation of an AS plant. In this paper, a robust phase-congruency-based method, augmented by top-hat and bottom-hat filtering, is proposed for segmentation of filamentous bacteria. Different metrics, such as accuracy, recall, variation of information, F-measure, and Rand index are used for the segmentation assessment. We propose an exact procedure to determine the total length of branched and unbranched filamentous bacteria. Moreover, a novel rotation invariant feature is proposed to determine the extent of the curvature of a filament. Finally, we investigated regression models for SVI of multiple AS wastewater treatment plants, based on the proposed image analysis parameters of the filaments. The modeling of SVI proves the significance of the proposed image analysis parameters for monitoring AS plants.",Microscopy;Image segmentation;Microorganisms;Monitoring;Image analysis;Gabor filters;Wastewater treatment;Image segmentation;image analysis;morphology;filamentous bacteria;activated sludge;phase-contrast microscopy,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780249
Cell Membrane Tracking in Living Brain Tissue Using Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy,"Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy is widely used for observing unstained biological samples that are otherwise optically transparent. Combining this optical technique with machine vision could enable the automation of many life science experiments; however, identifying relevant features under DIC is challenging. In particular, precise tracking of cell boundaries in a thick (>100μm) slice of tissue has not previously been accomplished. We present a novel deconvolution algorithm that achieves the state-of-the-art performance at identifying and tracking these membrane locations. Our proposed algorithm is formulated as a regularized least squares optimization that incorporates a filtering mechanism to handle organic tissue interference and a robust edge-sparsity regularizer that integrates dynamic edge tracking capabilities. As a secondary contribution, this paper also describes new community infrastructure in the form of a MATLAB toolbox for accurately simulating DIC microscopy images of in vitro brain slices. Building on existing DIC optics modeling, our simulation framework additionally contributes an accurate representation of interference from organic tissue, neuronal cell-shapes, and tissue motion due to the action of the pipette. This simulator allows us to better understand the image statistics (to improve algorithms), as well as quantitatively test cell segmentation and tracking algorithms in scenarios, where ground truth data is fully known.",Microscopy;Interference;Optical microscopy;Deconvolution;Image segmentation;Heuristic algorithms;Image reconstruction;Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy;automated patch clamping;cell simulation;sparse dynamical signal estimation,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2017.2787625
Model-Based Learning of Local Image Features for Unsupervised Texture Segmentation,"Features that capture well the textural patterns of a certain class of images are crucial for the performance of texture segmentation methods. The manual selection of features or designing new ones can be a tedious task. Therefore, it is desirable to automatically adapt the features to a certain image or class of images. Typically, this requires a large set of training images with similar textures and ground truth segmentation. In this paper, we propose a framework to learn features for texture segmentation when no such training data is available. The cost function for our learning process is constructed to match a commonly used segmentation model, the piecewise constant Mumford-Shah model. This means that the features are learned such that they provide an approximately piecewise constant feature image with a small jump set. Based on this idea, we develop a two-stage algorithm which first learns suitable convolutional features and then performs segmentation. We note that the features can be learned from a small set of images, from a single image, or even from image patches. The proposed method achieves a competitive rank in the Prague texture segmentation benchmark, and it is effective for segmenting histological images.",Image segmentation;Computational modeling;Cost function;Mathematical model;Training data;Data models;Texture segmentation;feature vector;geometric optimization;Mumford-Shah model;unsupervised learning,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2018.2792904
Influence of CdTe Deposition Temperature and Window Thickness on CdTe Grain Size and Lifetime After CdCl 2 Recrystallization,"Grain structure influences both transport and recombination in CdTe solar cells. Larger grains generally are obtained with higher deposition temperatures, but commercially it is important to avoid softening soda-lime glass. Furthermore, depositing at lower temperatures can enable different substrates and reduced cost in the future. We examine how initial deposition temperatures and morphology influence grain size and lifetime after CdCl2 recrystallization. Techniques are developed to estimate grain distribution quickly with low-cost optical microscopy, which compares well with electron backscatter diffraction data providing corroborative assessments of exposed CdTe grain structures. Average grain size increases as a function of CdCl2 temperature. For lower temperature close-spaced sublimation CdTe depositions, there can be more stress and grain segregation during recrystallization. However, the resulting lifetimes and grain sizes are similar to high-temperature CdTe depositions. The grain structures and lifetimes are largely independent of the presence and/or interdiffusion of Se at the interface, before and after the CdCl2 treatment.",II-VI semiconductor materials;Cadmium compounds;Grain size;Temperature measurement;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Optical diffraction;Cadmium telluride;charge carrier lifetime;grain boundaries;grain size;photovoltaic cells;semiconductor devices;thin film devices,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2018.2790701
Contrast Enhancement of Microscopy Images Using Image Phase Information,"Contrast enhancement is an important preprocessing step for the analysis of microscopy images. The main aim of contrast enhancement techniques is to increase the visibility of the cell structures and organelles by modifying the spatial characteristics of the image. In this paper, phase information-based contrast enhancement framework is proposed to overcome the limitations of existing image enhancement techniques. Inspired by the groundbreaking design of the phase contrast microscopy (PCM), the proposed image enhancement framework transforms the changes in image phase into the variations of magnitude to enhance the structural details of the image and to improve visibility. In addition, the concept of selective variation (SV) technique is introduced and enhancement parameters are optimized using SV. The experimental studies that were carried out on microscopy images show that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline enhancement frameworks. The contrast enhanced images produced by the proposed method have comparable cellular texture structure as PCM images.",Microscopy;Phase change materials;Discrete Fourier transforms;TV;Image enhancement;Histograms;Optical microscopy;Microscopy images;contrast enhancement;image phase information;Fourier transform;phase contrast microscopy,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2796646
Biophysical Characteristics of Human Neuroblastoma Cell in Oligomeric  $\beta $ -Amyloid (1–40) Cytotoxicity,"Beta amyloid (Aβ) peptide, which is a common neuropathological hallmark deposit in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease, typically comprises 39-43 amino acid residues. Aβ peptides exist as isoforms of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 with various lengths. In this research, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to investigate Aβ1-40 aggregations in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution. Toxic effect of Aβ1-40 oligomer was investigated in live SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by characterizing cell morphology and cell mechanics using high-resolution AFM scanning. Aβ1-40 oligomer-induced cytoskeleton reorganization was also observed under confocal microscopy, and it can account for reduction in Young's modulus of cells. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of tau increased after Aβ1-40 oligomer treatment, possibly resulting in microtubule disassembly. This paper demonstrates the linkage between cellular mechanical changes and neurodegeneration mediated by Aβ1-40. The method used implies promising applications of real-time monitoring of cellular mechanical properties given the toxic effects of Aβ1-40 on living neuronal cells.",Imaging;Polymers;Proteins;Force;Peptides;Biomembranes;Diseases;Beta amyloid;cellular mechanics;atomic force microscopy,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience,10.1109/TNB.2018.2800723
Hyphae Detection in Fungal Keratitis Images With Adaptive Robust Binary Pattern,"Fungal keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea that results from infection by fungal organisms. It has a high rate of blindness, which makes the accurate diagnosis of fungal keratitis important. Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique that assists doctors in diagnosing fungal keratitis, and cornea images obtained by confocal microscopy can be used to detect hyphae. The current challenges are how to classify normal cornea images with nerves and abnormal cornea images with hyphae and how to detect the hyphae in a complicated background. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel automatic hyphae detection method that assists doctors in making diagnoses. It includes two primary steps: texture classification of images and hyphae detection. In texture classification step, first, after image enhancement using a subregional contrast stretching algorithm, an adaptive robust binary pattern (ARBP), which is an improvement on the adaptive median binary pattern (AMBP), is proposed and adopted to extract texture features; and a support vector machine model is used to classify the normal and abnormal images. In the hyphae detection step, binarization and a connected domain process are used to further enhance the targets, and a line segment detector algorithm is adopted to detect the hyphae; then, the hyphal density is defined to quantitatively evaluate the infection severity. The contributions of this study include the improvement of the AMBP and the design of a novel framework. ARBP can extract effective texture features of images with relatively bright and small targets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",Cornea;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Medical services;Support vector machines;Medical diagnostic imaging;Fungal keratitis;texture analysis;ARBP;LSD;SVM,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2808941
A Weakly-Supervised Framework for Interpretable Diabetic Retinopathy Detection on Retinal Images,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection is a critical retinal image analysis task in the context of early blindness prevention. Unfortunately, in order to train a model to accurately detect DR based on the presence of different retinal lesions, typically a dataset with medical expert's annotations at the pixel level is needed. In this paper, a new methodology based on the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework is developed in order to overcome this necessity by leveraging the implicit information present on annotations made at the image level. Contrary to previous MIL-based DR detection systems, the main contribution of the proposed technique is the joint optimization of the instance encoding and the image classification stages. In this way, more useful mid-level representations of pathological images can be obtained. The explainability of the model decisions is further enhanced by means of a new loss function enforcing appropriate instance and mid-level representations. The proposed technique achieves comparable or better results than other recently proposed methods, with 90% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on Messidor, 93% AUC on DR1, and 96% AUC on DR2, while improving the interpretability of the produced decisions.",Lesions;Feature extraction;Visualization;Retina;Dictionaries;Diseases;Task analysis;Multiple instance learning;diabetic retinopathy detection;bag of visual words;retinal image analysis,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2816003
Facial biohashing based user-device physical unclonable function for bring your own device security,"Bring your own device (BYOD) is gaining popularity. Using multifarious personal devices in the workplace to perform work-related tasks brings new challenges to trust and privacy management. Existing authentication schemes usually target at user or device separately, while the BYOD system needs to ensure that only the authorized user with the trusted devices can be given access. This paper presents a novel biohashing based user-device physical unclonable function (UD PUF) to provide a bipartite authentication of both user and device for the BYOD system. Biometric features are extracted as user identity while PUF endows the device with an inseparable and unclonable “fingerprint”. Biohashing acts as an intermediary between these two incoherent macroscopic biometric and microscopic silicon entropy sources for security enhancement. The concept is demonstrated using a 64 × 64 image sensor PUF simulated in 180nm 3.3 V CMOS technology, and the ORL and yale databases of faces. Our preliminary experimental results showed that a genuine (user, device, challenge) combination exhibits a very low equal error rate of 0.032, and tampering of any elements of the tuple will cause the hamming distance between the “live” and enrolled templates to have nearly random distribution.",Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;CMOS image sensors;Authentication;Companies;Face recognition,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE),10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326074
Prediction of heart transplant rejection using histopathological whole-slide imaging,"Endomyocardial biopsies are the current gold standard for monitoring heart transplant patients for signs of cardiac allograft rejection. Manually analyzing the acquired tissue samples can be costly, time-consuming, and subjective. Computer-aided diagnosis, using digitized whole-slide images, has been used to classify the presence and grading of diseases such as brain tumors and breast cancer, and we expect it can be used for prediction of cardiac allograft rejection. In this paper, we first create a pipeline to normalize and extract pixel-level and object-level features from histopathological whole-slide images of endomyocardial biopsies. Then, we develop a two-stage classification algorithm, where we first cluster individual tiles and then use the frequency of tiles in each cluster for classification of each whole-slide image. Our results show that the addition of an unsupervised clustering step leads to higher classification accuracy, as well as the importance of object-level features based on the pathophysiology of rejection. Future expansion of this study includes the development of a multi-class classification pipeline for subtypes and grades of cardiac allograft rejection.",Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Heart;Support vector machines;Standards;Pipelines;Biomedical imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI),10.1109/BHI.2018.8333416
Automated 3-D Neuron Tracing With Precise Branch Erasing and Confidence Controlled Back Tracking,"The automatic reconstruction of single neurons from microscopic images is essential to enable large-scale data-driven investigations in neuron morphology research. However, few previous methods were able to generate satisfactory results automatically from 3-D microscopic images without human intervention. In this paper, we developed a new algorithm for automatic 3-D neuron reconstruction. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to iteratively track backward from the potential neuronal termini to the soma centre. An online confidence score is computed to decide if a tracing iteration should be stopped and discarded from the final reconstruction. The performance improvements comparing with the previous methods are mainly introduced by a more accurate estimation of the traced area and the confidence controlled back-tracking algorithm. The proposed algorithm supports large-scale batch-processing by requiring only one user specified parameter for background segmentation. We bench tested the proposed algorithm on the images obtained from both the DIADEM challenge and the BigNeuron challenge. Our proposed algorithm achieved the state-of-the-art results.",Neurons;Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Transforms;Biological system modeling;3-D neuron reconstruction;neuron morphology,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2018.2833420
Barcode fingerprinting: Unique identification of commercial products with their JAN/EAN/UCC barcode,"This paper proposes a method to uniquely identify commercial products with an item level barcode, specifically JAN/EAN/UCC, with which we usually cannot distinguish individual products. This research is motivated by the industrial and consumer needs for first-in-first-out operations of their inventories in the environment, where serial level barcodes, such as GS1-128 and SGTIN, or RFID are still not available. The proposal, referred to as Barcode Fingerprinting, utilizes the microscopic features of printed barcode stripes to discriminate each other. We zoom in a particular portion of a barcode image and apply SURF Algorithms and RANSAC Algorithms, to extract the microscopic features. The features are stored with the barcode ID and the time stamp for the future comparisons. We examined the feasibility of the proposal method by processing 100 barcodes of single brand PET bottles. The experiment reveals that we can uniquely identify each of the 100 barcodes by using Barcode Fingerprinting with a proper preprocessing of images.",Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Image matching;Cameras;Euclidean distance;Radiofrequency identification;image identification;feature matching;fingerprint;item management,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 4th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT),10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355122
Improved Random Forest for Classification,"We propose an improved random forest classifier that performs classification with a minimum number of trees. The proposed method iteratively removes some unimportant features. Based on the number of important and unimportant features, we formulate a novel theoretical upper limit on the number of trees to be added to the forest to ensure improvement in classification accuracy. Our algorithm converges with a reduced but important set of features. We prove that further addition of trees or further reduction of features does not improve classification performance. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on benchmark data sets. We further use the proposed classifier to detect mitotic nuclei in the histopathological data sets of breast tissues. We also apply our method on the industrial data set of dual-phase steel microstructures to classify different phases. Results of our method on different data sets show significant reduction in an average classification error compared with a number of competing methods.",Vegetation;Steel;Etching;Feature extraction;Microstructure;Ferrites;Manuals;Random forest;optimal number of trees;classification accuracy;feature reduction,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2018.2834830
Detection and tracking of migrating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from in vivo fluorescence time-lapse imaging data,"In this work, we develop a fully automatic algorithm named ""MCDT"" (Migrating Cell Detector and Tracker) for the integrated task of migrating cell detection, segmentation and tracking from in vivo fluorescence time-lapse microscopy imaging data. The interest of detecting and tracking migrating cells arouses from the scientific question in understanding the impact of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) migration in vivo, using advanced microscopy imaging techniques. Current practice of OPC mobility analysis relies on manual labeling, suffering from massive human labor, subjective biases, and weak reproducibility. Existing cell tracking methods have difficulties in analyzing such challenging data due to the extra complexity of in vivo data. Designed for in vivo data, MCDT circumvents the common strong assumption of separable feature distributions between foreground and background. Besides, by focusing on migrating cells (OPCs) only, MCDT relieves the burden of tracking all irrelevant cells correctly, not only accelerating the analysis but also achieving better accuracy in OPCs. Seed based segmentation and tracking by topology-preserved motion estimation endows MCDT with robustness to complex surroundings of the cell under tracking and to occasional inaccurate segmentation in some frames. We tested MCDT on imaging data of transgenic zebrafish larval spinal cord and MCDT showed very promising performance.",Tracking;In vivo;Fluorescence;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Motion segmentation;migrating cell detection;cell tracking;in vivo;time-lapse imaging;oligodendrocyte progenitor cells,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363730
Correlating cellular features with gene expression using CCA,"To understand the biology of cancer, joint analysis of multiple data modalities, including imaging and genomics, is crucial. We propose the use of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and a sparse variant as a preliminary discovery tool for identifying connections across modalities, specifically between gene expression and features describing cell and nucleus shape, texture, and stain intensity in histopathological images. Applied to 615 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, CCA revealed significant correlation of several image features with expression of PAM50 genes, known to be linked to outcome, while Sparse CCA revealed associations with enrichment of pathways implicated in cancer without leveraging prior biological understanding. These findings affirm the utility of CCA for joint phenotype-genotype analysis of cancer.",Correlation;Feature extraction;Gene expression;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Shape;Cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363694
Shape analysis and tracking of migrating macrophages,"Cell migration is important in many human processes of development and disease. In Cancer, migration can be related to metastasis or cell defects. A precise analysis of the cell shapes in biological studies could lead to insights about migration. Therefore, this paper describes an algorithm to iteratively segment, track and analyse the shape of macrophages from fluorescent microscopy image sequences. This process allows observation of shape variations as the cells migrate. The algorithm identifies and separates overlapping and non-overlapping cells, then for the non-overlapping cases analyses the shape and extracts a series of measurements, including the number of ""corner"" or pointy edges through a multiscale angle variation matrix, anglegram.

Vectorized persistent homology representations for characterizing glandular architecture in histology images,"Characterizing glandular architecture in histology images of adenocarcinomas is a fundamental problem in digital pathology, with important implications for computer-assisted diagnosis and grading. In this paper, we present a new set of features for encoding the glandular epithelium architecture based on two recently developed vectorized persistent homology representations called persistence images and persistence landscapes and demonstrate their application to colorectal cancer diagnosis.

The candidate multi-cut for cell segmentation,"Two successful approaches for the segmentation of biomedical images are (1) the selection of segment candidates from a merge-tree, and (2) the clustering of small superpixels by solving a Multi-Cut problem. In this paper, we introduce a model that unifies both approaches. Our model, the Candidate Multi-Cut (CMC), allows joint selection and clustering of segment candidates from a merge-tree. This way, we overcome the respective limitations of the individual methods: (1) the space of possible segmentations is not constrained to candidates of a merge-tree, and (2) the decision for clustering can be made on candidates larger than superpixels, using features over larger contexts. We solve the optimization problem of selecting and clustering of candidates using an integer linear program. On datasets of 2D light microscopy of cell populations and 3D electron microscopy of neurons, we show that our method generalizes well and generates more accurate segmentations than merge-tree or Multi-Cut methods alone.",Electron microscopy;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Neurons;Merging,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363658
Segmentation of cell nuclei using intensity-based model fitting and sequential convex programming,"We introduce a convex model-based approach for the segmentation of cell nuclei, which exploits both shape and intensity information. The model is directly fitted to the image intensities. Previous shape-based approaches either are not globally optimal or require prior binarization of an image. Our approach relies on a fast second-order optimization scheme to solve a sequence of convex programs and estimate the globally optimal solution based on the image intensities. Model fitting is performed within image regions which are determined by exploiting the local image structure. We evaluated our approach using fluorescence microscopy images of two different cell types and performed a quantitative comparison with previous methods.",Shape;Image segmentation;Computational modeling;Optimization;Biological system modeling;Microscopy;Convex functions;Fluorescence microscopy;cell segmentation;model fitting;convex optimization,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363659
Feature learning with component selective encoding for histopathology image classification,"In this paper, we present a new feature representation method, called the Component Selective Encoding (CSE), for automated histopathology image classification. While the integration of Fisher Vector (FV) encoding with convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated excellent performance in the classification of both general texture and histopathology images, the high dimensionality of FV descriptors could lead to suboptimal performance. Our proposed CSE method provides effective dimensionality reduction that is adaptive to the discriminativeness of individual Gaussian components in the FV descriptors.

Analysing double-strand breaks in cultured cells for drug screening applications by causal inference,"Double strand breaks (DSB) are a hallmark of DNA damage and genetic instability, which are important features of cancer cells. In addition, repair of DSBs provide interesting therapeutic targets. Fluorescence microscopy allows us to visualise DSBs in cells using a dedicated fluorescent marker, which is therefore an informative readout for drug screening applications. We therefore need robust methods in image analysis and statistical analysis to quantify DSBs in single cells and thereby to assess the drug effect with respect to the related pathways. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: first, we compare different DSB quantification schemes; and second we provide a sound statistical framework based on causal inference in order to detect drugs acting directly on DSBs. In particular this second aspect is so far notoriously neglected in the field, even though it is essential for the specific assignment of the drug effect.",Drugs;DNA;Perturbation methods;Cancer;Microscopy;Maintenance engineering;Cells (biology);High content screening;DNA damage;Double Strand breaks;Causal inference;cell lines,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363612
Analysis-synthesis model learning with shared features: A new framework for histopathological image classification,"Automated histopathological image analysis offers exciting opportunities for the early diagnosis of several medical conditions including cancer. There are however stiff practical challenges: 1.) discriminative features from such images for separating diseased vs. healthy classes are not readily apparent, and 2.) distinct classes, e.g. healthy vs. stages of disease continue to share several geometric features. We propose a novel Analysis-synthesis model Learning with Shared Features algorithm (ALSF) for classifying such images more effectively. In ALSF, a joint analysis and synthesis learning model is introduced to learn the classifier and the feature extractor at the same time. In this way, the computation load in patch-level based image classification can be much reduced. Crucially, we integrate into this framework the learning of a low rank shared dictionary and a shared analysis operator, which more accurately represents both similarities and differences in histopathological images from distinct classes. ALSF is evaluated on two challenging databases: (1) kidney tissue images provided by the Animal Diagnosis Lab (ADL) at the Pennsylvania State University and (2) brain tumor images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Experimental results confirm that ALSF can offer benefits over state of the art alternatives.",Feature extraction;Dictionaries;Analytical models;Cancer;Optimization;Databases;Computational modeling,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363555
Voting-based segmentation of overlapping nuclei in clarity images,"New tissue-clearing techniques and improvements in optical microscopy have rapidly advanced capabilities to acquire volumetric imagery of neural tissue at resolutions of one micron or better. As sizes for data collections increase, accurate automatic segmentation of cell nuclei becomes increasingly important for quantitative analysis of imaged tissue. We present a cell nucleus segmentation method that is formulated as a parameter estimation problem with the goal of determining the count, shapes, and locations of nuclei that most accurately describe an image. We applied our new voting-based approach to fluorescence confocal microscopy images of neural tissue stained with DAPI, which highlights nuclei. Compared to manual counting of cells in three DAPI images, our method outperformed three existing approaches. On a manually labeled high-resolution DAPI image, our method also outperformed those methods and achieved a cell count accuracy of 98.99% and mean Dice coefficient of 0.6498.",Image segmentation;Ellipsoids;Shape;Microscopy;Image resolution;Manuals,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363660
A method for quantification of calponin expression in myoepithelial cells in immunohistochemical images of ductal carcinoma in situ,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is breast cancer confined within mammary ducts, surrounded by an intact myoepithelial cell layer that prevents local invasion. A DCIS diagnosis confers increased lifetime risk of developing invasive breast cancer (IBC) and results in surgical excision with radiation, and possibly endocrine- or chemo-therapy. DCIS is known to be over treated, with associated co-morbidities. Biomarkers are needed that delineate patients at low risk of DCIS progression from patients requiring more aggressive treatment. Investigating the role of myoepithelial cell differentiation in barrier function is anticipated to provide insight into DCIS progression and delineate between low and high risk lesions. Here, we develop a high throughput technique to assess loss of myoepithelial differentiation markers. This method facilitates automated analysis of a clinically relevant histopathologic feature, as demonstrated by a high correlation with pathologist annotation (r = 0.959), and further, contributes analytical foundations to a multiplexed immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach.",Lesions;Breast cancer;Multiplexing;Proteins;Image segmentation;DCIS;calponin;invasive breast cancer;feature engineering;myoepithelial cell,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363692
Resolving single cells in heavily clustered Nissl-stained images for the analysis of brain cytoarchitecture,"The analysis of the cytoarchitecture of a tissue is of great importance for the understanding of development, behavior and disease. This is also true when analyzing tissue specimens of the brain, for analyzing cells morphology and their spatial organization. To this end, on the Nissl-stained each single cells present in the sample needs to be detected, classified according to its morphology and position. The dimension of typical histological images and the sheer numbers of cells present make the task impossible to be carried out manually. Additionally, the presence of background and staining heterogeneity, clutter, heavily clustered cells, and variability in shape and appearance of cells, makes the task difficult also for automatic methods. We present a method that building on the tentative detection obtained by local thresholding and radial symmetry transform, represent each cell cluster as a sparse mixture of gaussians. We show that the proposed method performs well both in terms of precision and recall, obtaining a F1-score of 0.87 on Nissl-stained images of the cerebellum.",Cerebellum;Shape;Image segmentation;Organizations;Microscopy;Object recognition;Random access memory;histology;brain;segmentation;cell detection;radial symmetry;mixture models,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363608
Minimal annotation training for segmentation of microscopy images,"In many biomedical applications, successful training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is restricted by an insufficient amount of annotated images. Although image augmentation can help training CNNs from a relatively small image set, in many applications, the objects of interest cannot be accurately delineated due to their fuzzy shape, image quality or a limitation in time, experience or knowledge of the expert performing the annotation. We propose an approach for training a CNN for segmentation of images with minimal annotation. The annotation consists of center points or lines of target objects of approximately known size. We demonstrate this approach in the application of Rift Valley virus segmentation in a challenging transmission electron microscopy image dataset. Our method achieves a Dice score of 0.900 and intersection over union of 0.831. Using the suggested minimal annotation training is particularly useful for applications in which full object annotations are not available or feasible.",Training;Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Microscopy;Convolution;Shape;Manuals;manual labeling;transmission electron microscopy;deep learning;convolutional neural networks,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363599
Classification of the fibronectin variants with curvelets,"The role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the evolution of certain diseases (e.g. fibrosis, cancer) is generally accepted but yet to be completely understood. A numerical model that captures the physical properties of the ECM, could convey certain connections between the topology of its constituents and their associated biological features. This study addresses the analysis and modeling of fibrillar networks containing Fi-bronectin (FN) networks, a major ECM molecule, from 2D confocal microscopy images. We leveraged the advantages of the fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT), in order to obtain a multiscale and multidirectional representation of the FN fibrillar networks. This step was validated by performing a classification among the different variants of FN upregulated in disease states with a multi-class classification algorithm, DAG-SVM. Subsequently, we designed a method to ensure the invariance to rotation of the curvelet features. Our results indicate that the curvelets offer an appropriate discriminative model for the FN networks, that is able to characterize the local fiber geometry.",Feature extraction;Transforms;Electronic countermeasures;Support vector machines;Geometry;Image reconstruction;Analytical models;FN networks;ECM;curvelets;DAG-SVM classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018),10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363723
Corneal Endothelial Cell Segmentation by Classifier-Driven Merging of Oversegmented Images,"Corneal endothelium images obtained by in vivo specular microscopy provide important information to assess the health status of the cornea. Estimation of clinical parameters, such as cell density, polymegethism, and pleomorphism, requires accurate cell segmentation. State-of-the-art techniques to automatically segment the endothelium are error-prone when applied to images with low contrast and/or large variation in cell size. Here, we propose an automatic method to segment the endothelium. Starting with an oversegmented image comprised of superpixels obtained from a stochastic watershed segmentation, the proposed method uses intensity and shape information of the superpixels to identify and merge those that constitute a cell, using support vector machines. We evaluated the automatic segmentation on a data set of in vivo specular microscopy images (Topcon SP-1P), obtaining 95.8% correctly merged cells and 2.0% undersegmented cells. We also evaluated the parameter estimation against the results of the vendor's built-in software, obtaining a statistically significant better precision in all parameters and a similar or better accuracy. The parameter estimation was also evaluated on three other data sets from different imaging modalities (confocal microscopy, phase-contrast microscopy, and fluorescence confocal microscopy) and tissue types (ex vivo corneal endothelium and retinal pigment epithelium). In comparison with the estimates of the data sets' authors, we achieved statistically significant better accuracy and precision in all parameters except pleomorphism, where a similar accuracy and precision were obtained.",Microscopy;Image segmentation;Cornea;In vivo;Support vector machines;Optical microscopy;Merging;Specular microscopy;confocal microscopy;merging superpixels;stochastic watershed;support vector machines,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2018.2841910
Infrared Microscopy Imaging of Index-Finger Pads,"In this paper, we present the mid-wave infrared microscopic view of index finger pads of voluntary subjects, an analysis of their thermoregulation response, and a study of their thermal spatial morphology. This is accomplished by means of a custom-made mid-wave infrared imager fitted with appropriate infrared optics. The microscopic thermal images enable us to capture spatial and temporal thermal information emitted from the microscopic finger pad’s blood vessels and irrigation system, spatially attenuated by the finger pad’s skin morphology. As a consequence, we can acquire and extract features that visual-spectrum microscopes or regular infrared imagers are not able to disclose. The thermoregulation response is acquired by exposing to a thermal stress the finger pads of voluntary subjects, while a microscopic infrared sequence was recorded. We used standard infrared imaging and signal processing techniques to extract the thermoregulation curves of the infrared sequences, and the thermal morphology features were estimated from the same imagery. One of the key findings of this paper is that three distinctive index finger pads infrared morphology patterns were identified, and important insights of the thermal behavior of the micro-spatial finger pad anatomy were observed for the very first time.",Fingers;Microscopy;Skin;Thermal analysis;Optical microscopy;Indexes;Infrared imaging;thermal analysis;image processing;microscopy;fingerprint recognition,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845110
Design based automatic defect classification at advanced technology nodes: DI: Defect inspection and reduction,"As the semiconductor industry continues to advance to smaller and smaller nodes, Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopy (DR-SEM) and ADC (Automatic Defect Classification) face increasingly difficult challenges. The Defects of Interest (DOI) shrink as the features shrink, leading to imaging difficulty purely based on scale. Also, more complex defect analysis is required for DOI's formed during multiple patterning steps or DOI's created in previous steps. A smart approach to ADC must be adopted which allows for high quality defect classification focused on root cause analysis and yield prediction in short cycle times. In this paper, we present results from novel approach: Design Based ADC (DBA).

Leukocyte segmentation and counting based on microscopic blood images using HSV saturation component with blob analysis,"Determining the accurate count of leukocytes commonly known as WBC (white blood cells) in a blood test is critical in evaluating and diagnosing an individual's health particularly on a wide range of diseases which includes infections, anemia, leukemia etc. There are two widely used methods to determine leukocyte count. First, is through the use of hematology analyzer and the other is done manually. Nowadays, with the advent of technology leukocyte counting was improved through the use of digital image processing. However, the algorithm of the existing methods involves too many steps which complicates the image processing phase. Thus, we considered counting leukocytes by incorporating the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) saturation component with blob analysis on microscopic blood images which highlights the eccentricity and area features for counting to simplify existing methodologies which in turn generates faster and more accurate results.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;White blood cells;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;leukocyte;white blood cells;blood counter;HSV image processing;blob analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 3rd International Conference on Control and Robotics Engineering (ICCRE),10.1109/ICCRE.2018.8376475
Binary Gabor pattern feature extraction technique for hardwood species classification,"This paper presents a binary Gabor pattern (BGP) feature extraction technique to acquire significant texture features of microscopic images of hardwood species and later these feature are used to discriminate the hardwood species into 75 different categories. The usefulness of the BGP feature extraction technique has been examined with the help of three classifiers, namely, linear support vector machine (LSVM), radial basis function support vector machine (RBFSVM) and random forest (RF) classification algorithms. Further, the performance of the BGP feature extraction technique for hardwood species classification has been evaluated against several texture feature techniques. The comparison of the results obtained by the feature extraction techniques recommends that BGP feature extraction technique has been better for microscopic images of hardwood species classification than the other feature extraction techniques.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Support vector machines;Gray-scale;Forestry;Vegetation;Information technology;Binary Gabor pattern;Support vector machine;Local binary pattern;Hardwood species,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT),10.1109/RAIT.2018.8389066
Robustness of sift feature descriptors to imaging parameters in laser scanning microscopy,"Confocal laser scanning microscopy relies on illuminating the specimen with a focused scanning laser beam and constructing sharp optical sections/images of the investigated specimen by allowing signals from the focal plane only via a pinhole. It is a valuable technique to study fluorescent cells and tissues in-vivo. Its power and potential can be augmented by the use of computer vision methods. However such methods are typically transferred to the microscopy field directly without taking microscopy-specific variations into account. Accordingly in this study we evaluate the robustness of SIFT feature descriptors, a popular computer vision method, against variations in microscopy-specific parameters over a benchmark dataset acquired in a principled manner. Results show that SIFT descriptors are highly robust against variations in laser beam power, whereas their robustness diminishes with larger variations in photomultiplier tube gain.",Microscopy;Laser beams;Dogs;Robustness;Optical microscopy;Lasers;SIFT;Feature descriptor;Confocal laser scanning microscopy;Histopathology;Imaging parameters;Robustness,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU),10.1109/SIU.2018.8404623
Segnet-based gland segmentation from colon cancer histology images,"The morphology of glands is the main basis of colon cancer diagnosis and accurate segmentation of glands from histology images is a prerequisite for correct clinical diagnosis.

Second, the network parameters are optimized according to the training results. Finally, the trained Segnet is used to perform segmentation test on both Parts A and B of Warwick-QU. The results show that the presented method achieves segmentation accuracy of 0.882 on Part A and 0.8636 on Part B, and shape similarity 106.6471 on Part A and 102.5729 on Part B, respectively.

An Evaluation on the Robustness of Five Popular Keypoint Descriptors to Image Modifications Specific to Laser Scanning Microscopy,"Laser scanning microscopy (LSM) techniques are of paramount importance at this time for key domains such as biology, medicine, or materials science. Computer vision methods are instrumental for boosting the potential of LSM, providing reliable results for important tasks, such as image segmentation, registration, classification, or retrieval in a fraction of the time that a human expert would require (at similar or even higher accuracy levels). Image keypoint extraction and description represent essential building blocks of modern computer vision approaches, and the development of such techniques has gained massive interest over the past couple of decades. In this paper, we compare side-by-side five popular keypoint description techniques, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), speeded-up robust features (SURF), binary robust invariant scalable keypoints (BRISK), fast retina keypoint (FREAK) and BLOCK, with respect to their capacity to represent in a reproducible manner image regions contained in LSM data sets acquired under different acquisition conditions. We evaluate this capacity in terms of descriptor matching performance, using data sets acquired in a principled manner and a thorough Precision-Recall analysis. We identify which of the five evaluated techniques is most robust to specific LSM image modifications associated to the laser beam power, photomultiplier gain, or pixel dwell, and show that certain pre-processing steps have the potential to enhance keypoint matching.",Microscopy;Computer vision;Laser beams;Optical microscopy;Robustness;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Keypoint descriptors;laser scanning microscopy;scale invariant feature transform (SIFT);speeded-up robust features (SURF);binary robust invariant scalable keypoints (BRISK);fast retina keypoint (FREAK);BLOCK,ARTICLE,2018,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2855264

Countering Sensor Drift in X-ray Microscopy with Fast and Robust Optimal Control,"In X-ray microscopy it is imperative that the relative position between the optics stage, that carries the X-ray focusing optics, and the sample stage follow a certain trajectory while either the optics or sample stage is being scanned. Main challenges in achieving this requirement include - open loop drift, environmental disturbance, measurement noise, sensor drift, and control hardware limit. The state-of-the-art in X-ray microscopy at Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) features an H∞ control architecture applied to only the optics stage or both the optics and sample stage, achieving the objectives of large tracking bandwidth over 200 Hz, good positioning resolution on the order of nanometers, rejection of environmental disturbance, attenuation of measurement noise, good X-ray diffraction image resolution and increased imaging bandwidth. However, an unaddressed issue in our existing robust control design is that the sensors and the fixtures that hold the sensors drift with time due to changing air temperature in the APS beamline. Since the drift of sensor itself is not measured, it affects the relative position between the focusing optics and sample resulting into imaging artifacts and reduced image resolution. In this article, we demonstrate the rejection of the sensor drift by directly measuring the displacement of the sensor with respect to the global reference frame. Both the measured sensor displacement (i.e. sensor drift) and optics stage displacement are incorporated in the H∞ control architecture to achieve the above mentioned objectives in addition to minimal relative displacement between the optics stage and the sample stage. This will improve the X-ray image resolution and reduce image artifacts.",X-ray imaging;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Bandwidth;Temperature measurement;Image resolution,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC),10.23919/ACC.2018.8431093
A Comparison of Different State Representations for Reinforcement Learning Based Variable Speed Limit Control,"Variable Speed Limit Control (VSLC) is one control method for alleviating congestions on urban motorways. Machine learning techniques, like Reinforcement Learning (RL), are a promising alternative for setting up VSLC because an optimal control policy can be achieved with a smaller computational burden in comparison with optimal control approaches. A drawback is a large number of learning iterations and the problem of the exponential expansion of the state space dimension. This can be solved with function approximation techniques. Three different approaches for feature-based state representation in RL based VSLC are compared in this paper regarding the convergence of Total Time Spent. The microscopic traffic simulator VISSIM with a representative traffic model is used to evaluate the compared approaches. Results show that function approximation methods outperform RL based VSLC formulated with a lookup table by an average improvement of 10 %, where feature extraction methods (Coarse and Tile) coding showed slightly faster learning rate.",Function approximation;Convergence;Encoding;Learning (artificial intelligence);Optimal control;Safety;Machine learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 26th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED),10.1109/MED.2018.8442986
A Novel Automatic Image Stitching Algorithm for Ceramic Microscopic Images,"The polyphase ceramic images taken by electron microscope contain rich material science information. However, in practical scientific engineering, the researchers can only obtain a small part material image by microscope. Therefore, it is necessary to apply image stitching technology to obtain full-size, information-rich images. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel automatic image stitching algorithm for ceramic microscopic images. Firstly, an algorithm for sorting out-ordered ceramic images into ordered sequences was proposed, which is based on local matching relationship and specific threshold. Next, an image stitching algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Speeded Up Robust Feature (SURF) was proposed to get the complete image. The experimental result shows that the proposed method is more feasible and effective than traditional Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).",Feature extraction;Ceramics;Electron microscopy;Principal component analysis;Sorting;Robustness;Image Stitching;Material Science;Computer Vision;SURF;Ceramic Images,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,"2018 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing (ICALIP)",10.1109/ICALIP.2018.8455766
Benchmarking of Image Registration Methods for Differently Stained Histological Slides,"Image registration is a common task for many biomedical analysis applications. The present work focuses on the benchmarking of registration methods on differently stained histological slides. This is a challenging task due to the differences in the appearance model, the repetitive texture of the details and the large image size, between other issues. Our benchmarking data is composed of 616 image pairs at two different scales - average image diagonal 2.4k and 5k pixels. We compare eleven fully automatic registration methods covering the widely used similarity measures (and optimization strategies with both linear and elastic transformation). For each method, the best parameter configuration is found and subsequently applied to all the image pairs. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated from several perspectives - the registrations (in)accuracy on manually annotated landmarks, the method robustness and its processing computation time.",Robustness;Benchmark testing;Image registration;Optimization;Strain;Measurement;Image segmentation;Image registration;benchmarking;pathology;histological slides;stained tissue,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 25th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP.2018.8451040
Granulometry-Based Descriptor for Pathological Tissue Discrimination in Histopathological Images,"Prostate cancer is one of the types of cancer with the highest incidence in humans. In particular, prostate cancer is the main cause of death from cancer in men over 70 years of age. The automatic analysis of histological images is nowadays a key factor for helping doctors in the diagnosis task. In this paper, we present granulometries as a novel image descriptor to identify abnormal patterns in the prostatic tissue. The morphological alteration suffered by the main structures of pathological glands are registered by the proposed descriptor and achieved in a feature vector. A committee of SVM classifiers is trained making use of the extracted information with the aim of discriminating between healthy and pathological tissue. The performance of the proposed image descriptor is validated in 45 images provided by the Hospital Clínico of Valencia.

Automatic Determination of The G-band Chromosomes Number based on Geometric Features,"One of the source used to diagnose the genetic disorders and abnormalities is the light microscopic images of the chromosomes. The first step to check for the abnormalities is to count the chromosome. Many researches have been done on chromosome counting from the images, but the results still need an improvement on complicated case, the cluster of mixing patterns of chromosomes including touching, overlapping, and other patterns. The main objective of this research is to focus and increase the performance of chromosome number determination especially the cluster with the complicated pattern of chromosome. The paper presents a new technique, to determine the number of complicated chromosome image (DNCC) using geometric features including endpoints, and intersection points of the skeletonized chromosome image after pre-processing.

Abnormality Detection in Eye Fundus Retina,"The investigation of clinical reports suggested that more than ten percent patients with diabetes have a high risk of eye issues, since eye is a very sensitive organ in human body; it responsible for sensing information in the visible light domain, So, early detection of any abnormal features in eye fundus retinal is essential. Experts need more professional automatic detection way to detect the yellowish spots caused by diabetes; to control its propagation on the retina. The retinal image analysis is a natural approach to deal with eye diseases and other diseases that affecting eye fundus. The paper introduces a new medical diagnosis model for optic disc detection in fundus images by automated segmentation of landmarks. Automatic segmentation of retinal blood vessels from retinal images is applied. The proposed model integrates adaptive Otsu's Threshold, Hough transform and kirsch's template filtering for automated detection of candidate optic nerves. Traditional segmentation methods which are based on spatial properties of the optic disc achieve good results but usually fail to detect the optic disc in pathological images where abnormalities found, such as large exudates, are confused with the optic disc due to their similar appearance, color, and texture. A proposed segmentation model is introduced, which integrates vessels detection mechanism to achieve better sensitivity rates and high performance. Experimental results showed that the number of false responses are greatly reduced in the presence of other similar abnormal signs found in the eye fundus retina images. Experiments showed that proposed model produced high performance in detection of optic disc, blood vessels and exudates under different infection.

Classification of Primary Cilia in Microscopy Images Using Convolutional Neural Random Forests,"Accurate detection and classification of primary cilia in microscopy images is an essential and fundamental task for many biological studies including diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Manual detection and classification of individual primary cilia by visual inspection is time consuming, and prone to induce subjective bias. However, automation of this process is challenging as well, due to clutter, bleed-through, imaging noise, and the similar characteristics of the non-cilia candidates present within the image. We propose a convolutional neural random forest classifier that combines a convolutional neural network with random decision forests to classify the primary cilia in fluorescence microscopy images. We compare the performance of the proposed classifier with that of an unsupervised k-means classifier and a supervised multi-layer perceptron classifier on real data consisting of 8 representative cilia images, containing more than 2300 primary cilia using precision/recall rates, ROC curves, AUC, and Fβ-score for classification accuracy.

Performance of Supervised Classifiers for Damage Scoring of Zebrafish Neuromasts,"Supervised machine learning schemes are widely used to perform classification tasks. There is a wide variety of classifiers in use today, such as single- and multi-class support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, naive Bayes classifiers with or without kernel density estimation, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and numerous neural network architectures. Our prior work used high-level shape, intensity, and texture features as predictors in a single-class support vector machine classifier to classify images of zebrafish neuromasts obtained using confocal microscopy into four discrete damage classes.

Label-Free Imaging of Thick Specimens Using Gradient Light Interference Microscopy (GLIM),"Light scattering limits the quality of optical imaging of unlabeled specimens: too little scattering and the sample is transparent, exhibiting low contrast and too much scattering washes the structure information altogether. As a result, current instruments, target specifically either the thin (low-scattering) specimens or the optically thick (multiply scattering) samples. We developed gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM) to extract 3D information from both thin and thick unlabeled specimens. GLIM exploits the principle of low-coherence interferometry to extract phase information, which in turn yields strong, intrinsic contrast of transparent samples, such as single cells. Because it combines multiple intensity images that correspond to controlled phase shifts between two interfering waves, GLIM is capable of suppressing the incoherent background due to multiple scattering. Due to the specific, common path interferometric geometry used, the two interfering fields are affected identically by multiple scattering and remain comparable in power even in deep tissue, thus, allowing them to interfere with great contrast. Thus, GLIM yields real-time tomography of optically thick samples via full field imaging. These results indicate that GLIM can become a valuable label-free analysis tool for in-vitro fertilization, where contrast agents and fluorophores may impact the viability of the embryo.

Towards Automated Tissue Characterization Using Parallel Bag-of-Features Experts Dealing with Two-Photon Excitation Fluorescence and Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy Datasets,"Label-free tissue imaging with Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM) techniques such as Two-Photon Excitation Fluorescence Microscopy (TPEF) or Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy (SHG) can provide cues of similar pathologic relevance to the information collected for characterization / confirmation purposes with traditional histopathology protocols based on fixation and staining. To date, various approaches for the automated characterization of MPM datasets have been proposed, but usually these address the outputs of a single technique, while MPM imaging sessions can simultaneously yield multiple information categories associated to distinct modalities. We discuss here the main concepts of the Bag-of-Features (BoF) paradigm used for automated image classification and retrieval, and a series of past experiments that dealt with BoF based tissue characterization. Further on, we present some of our connected efforts placed on the problem of human epithelial tissue characterization with TPEF & SHG and introduce a concept for MPM data classification based on multiple BoF experts that utilize in a parallel manner complementary information categories.",Microscopy;Dictionaries;Fluorescence;Frequency conversion;Image classification;Feature extraction;two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy;second harmonic generation fluorescence microscopy;automated tissue characterization;bag-of-features.,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 20th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON),10.1109/ICTON.2018.8473668
Automated Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Using Wavelet Based Entropy Features,"Breast cancer is one of the most common and serious threat around worldwide for women. It is necessary to prognosis of Histopathology image in order to avoid death rate also early detection is required for the best treatment. Histopathology refers to the examination of biopsy sample by a pathologist under microscope. The pathologist locates, analyze and classify the image type and grade the image. The classification depends on structure of tissue, cell distribution, and shape of the cell which decides the histopathology image as benign or malignant. Manual classification of image is most time consuming and prone to error. To overcome this difficulty automated diagnosis using machine learning is needed for accurate and early diagnosis. In this paper k-means clustering is used for segmentation of cell nuclei and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) is applied to the segmented image. Coiflets is one of the discrete wavelets used in this paper it has scaling functions with vanishing moments. Energy, shannon entropy and log energy entropy features are extracted from the LL, LH, HL and HH sub bands. In the present work we have used BreakHis (The Breast Cancer Histopathological Images) dataset.

Using RBF algorithm for Scanning Acoustic Microscopy inspection of flip chip,"With the increasing prevalence of flip-chip technology in high density assembly, more attention has been paid to the microbump defect inspection in the flip chip. However, the traditional techniques have some disadvantages, which makes it difficult to diagnose the chips efficiently. Therefore, new inspection approaches for solder bump are being investigated. In this article, the radial basis function neural network (RBF) combined with the scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) technology is proposed for inspection of missing microbump defects. The ultrasonic transducer was used to test the flip chip. The solder joints were segmented from the SAM image on the basis of gradient of gray scale, and representative characteristics of micro solder balls were extracted. Then RBF network was used for identification. The results reflect that RBF algorithm with high recognition rate is effective for diagnosis of missing-bump defects.",Flip-chip devices;Inspection;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Acoustics;Radial basis function networks;Microbump;SAM technology;RBF algorithm,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 19th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT),10.1109/ICEPT.2018.8480418
Tracking Gene Expression via Light Sheet Microscopy and Computer Vision in Living Organisms,"Automated tracking of spatiotemporal gene expression using in vivo microscopy images have given great insight into understanding developmental processes in multicellular organisms. Many existing analysis tools rely on the fluorescent tagging of cell wall or cell nuclei localized proteins to assess position, orientation, and overall shape of an organism; information necessary for determining locations of gene expression activity. Particularly in plants, organism lines that have fluorescent tags can take months to develop, which can be time consuming and costly. We propose an automated solution for analyzing spatial characteristics of gene expression without the necessity of fluorescent tagged cell walls or cell nuclei. Our solution indicates, segments, and tracks gene expression using a fluorescent imaging channel of a light sheet microscope while determining gene expression location within an organism from a Brightfield (non-fluorescent) imaging channel.

Analysis of Cellular Feature Differences of Astrocytomas with Distinct Mutational Profiles Using Digitized Histopathology Images,"Cellular phenotypic features derived from histopathology images are the basis of pathologic diagnosis and are thought to be related to underlying molecular profiles. Due to overwhelming cell numbers and population heterogeneity, it remains challenging to quantitatively compute and compare features of cells with distinct molecular signatures. In this study, we propose a self-reliant and efficient analysis framework that supports quantitative analysis of cellular phenotypic difference across distinct molecular groups. To demonstrate efficacy, we quantitatively analyze astrocytomas that are molecularly characterized as either Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant (MUT) or wildtype (WT) using imaging data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Representative cell instances that are phenotypically different between these two groups are retrieved after segmentation, feature computation, data pruning, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering.

Detection of Sickle Cell Disease Based on an Improved Watershed Segmentation,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most popular inherited blood disease, that red blood cells change its shape form circular shape to sickle shape and loses its main job which carries oxygen throughout the body. The watershed segmentation method has become highly developed for automated analysis of overlapping red blood cell microscopic images. The aim of this work is to suppress over segmentation problem which is a major drawback of the watershed algorithm.

Adaptive Threshold Determination Based on Entropy in Active Contour without Edge Method for Malaria Parasite Candidate Detection,"Malaria is one of the most serious diseases that often leads to death. The identification of malaria parasites is commonly done by using microscopic images that are divided into two types: thick and thin blood smear. In thin blood smear images, malaria parasite candidates can be easily identified based on blood cell characteristics. However, in the thick blood smear images, the malaria parasite will be difficult to be distinguished from other objects that are also in the blood smear image. There are several approaches to facilitate the identification of malaria parasites in blood smear images, one of which is by utilizing computer-aided diagnosis. This research proposed a scheme to solve the problem of parasite detection in thick blood smear using segmentation approach. The sensitivity of the proposed scheme obtained was 98.04%, indicating that most of parasites in thick blood smear images have been detected; however, the drawback of the sensitivity result is related to the high number of false positive detections. The main objective of this study is to detect the objects in a complete form in the entire slide images using the segmentation approach.",Diseases;Blood;Image segmentation;Entropy;Mathematical model;Microscopy;Digital images;Malaria;Microscopic Image;Thick Blood Smear;Segmentation;Detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 4th International Conference on Science and Technology (ICST),10.1109/ICSTC.2018.8528585

Using this information, some factors (form factor, circularity factor, and deviation factor) involved in the classification of red cells are calculated. The classification process has two phases: the first separates red cells in normal and abnormal type and the second classifies the abnormal in three subclasses.

Screening and Identify the Bone Cancer/Tumor using Image Processing,"Medical imaging is playing an imperative function in analysis and healing of disease and locating tumours and finding of cancerous cells in premature phase. As a traditional approach for identifying bone features, is microscopic images were used. These images are acquired by using micro radiography, where it needed to repeated, time consuming and labor intensive process. This technique is unable to identify the cancerous cells because of the presence of noise in the images. Hence there is a need for automated and reliable techniques to carry out the image processing analysis. As a first stage, the most basic part of image processing is to denoising without interrupting the diagnostics information during the removal of noise. The earlier process removes the noise and introduce blur in the image. In order to get precise image processing, we have implemented soft and hard threshold with various coefficients and to measure the threshold Visu shrink was used. It was found that the Wavelet deionsing tool was a powerful tool for image enhancement. In the session, our proposed work was associated with pre-processing techniques in order to remove the noise and to get smooth images. This process will help to improve the quality of the image and also eliminate the false segments. In order to detect the existence of bone cancer and to determine its stage, K- means algorithm was used and subsequently to get smooth picture, edge segmentation process was performed. The principle component of GA analysis, distinguish between the benign and malignant growth of the bone tumor. Our research focus was mainly to predict or detect the bone tumor on right time and stage of the bone tumor.

Automated nucleus detection is troublesome in Mitotic nuclei come out as hyper chromatic objects without a clear nuclear membrane in H and E (Hematoxyline and Eosin) in histopathology images. Extracting poor contrast features and falsely detect tumour cells present in breast images from single modality image is the problem. The shape of nucleus is varies for different phases. The identification procedure moves toward becoming time-consuming and to a great degree troublesome because of huge assortment of shapes, size and low recurrence of nuclei undergoing mitosis is the major problem that leads to false positive results in detection process of nuclei.

Automatic Quantification of Stomata for High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping,"Stomatal morphology is a key phenotypic trait for plants' response analysis under various environmental stresses (e.g. drought, salinity etc.). Stomata exhibit diverse characteristics with respect to orientation, size, shape and varying degree of papillae occlusion. Thus, the biologists currently rely on manual or semi-automatic approaches to accurately compute its morphological traits based on scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of leaf surface. In contrast to these subjective and low-throughput methods, we propose a novel automated framework for stomata quantification. It is realized based on a hybrid approach where the candidate stomata region is first detected by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the occlusion is dealt with an inpainting algorithm. In addition, we propose stomata segmentation based quantification framework to solve the problem of shape, scale and occlusion in an end-to-end manner. The performance of the proposed automated frameworks is evaluated by comparing the derived traits with manually computed morphological traits of stomata. With no prior information about its size and location, the hybrid and end-to-end machine learning frameworks shows a correlation of 0.94 and 0.93, respectively on rice stomata images. Furthermore, they successfully enable wheat stomata quantification showing generalizability in terms of cultivars.",Scanning electron microscopy;Apertures;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Microsoft Windows;Stress;Morphology,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),10.1109/ICPR.2018.8546196
Convolutional Features-Based CRF Graph Matching for Tracking of Densely Packed Cells,"The tracking of plant cells across large-scale microscopy image sequences is very challenging, because plant cells are densely packed in a specific honeycomb structure, and the microscopy images can be randomly translated, rotated and scaled in the imaging process. This paper proposes a convolutional features-based conditional random field (CRF) graph matching method to track plant cells in unregistered image sequences, by exploiting deep features extracted from deep convolutional neural networks and tight spatial topology feature of neighboring cells as contextual information. Because the extracted convolutional feature and spatial topology feature are resilient to image translation, rotation and scaling, the proposed CRF matching approach is able to track plant cells across unregistered image sequences. Compared with other plant cell tracking methods, the experimental results show that the proposed method improves the tracking accuracy rate by about 30% in the unregistered cell image sequences.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Image sequences;Image segmentation;Topology;Pipelines;Image edge detection;cell tracking;conditional random field;convolutional features;microscopy image sequences,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),10.1109/ICPR.2018.8545249

There are fish-like scales and pits on the surface of elytron. The interior microstructures are composed of multilayer of epicuticle, and then is feather-like units of exocuticle. The nanomechanical properties were got by nanoindentation technique. The values of reduced modulus (Er) and hardness (H) of the transverse section display a declining tendency from endocuticleto endocuticle, and fluctuant variation for longitudinal section. The relatively higher Er and H of elytron surface play a role in resisting force, and the lower strength is to buffer. Additionally, the optical testing of elytron specimen was conducted by angle-resolved spectroscopy system in different angles from 0° to 60°.

Area-Based Depth Estimation for Monochromatic Feature-Sparse Orthographic Capture,"With the rapid development of light field technology, depth estimation has been highlighted as one of the critical problems in the field, and a number of approaches have been proposed to extract the depth of the scene. However, depth estimation by stereo matching becomes difficult and unreliable when the captured images lack both color and feature information. In this paper, we propose a scheme that extracts robust depth from monochromatic, feature-sparse scenes recorded in orthographic sub-aperture images. Unlike approaches which rely on the rich color and texture information across the sub-aperture views, our approach is based on depth from focus techniques. First, we superimpose shifted sub-aperture images on top of an arbitrarily chosen central image. To focus on different depths, the shift amount is varied based on the micro-lens array properties. Next, an area-based depth estimation approach is applied to find the best match among the focal stack and generate the dense depth map. This process is repeated for each sub-aperture image. Finally, occlusions are handled by merging depth maps generated from different central images followed by a voting process. Results show that the proposed scheme is more suitable than conventional depth estimation approaches in the context of orthographic captures that have insufficient color and feature information, such as microscopic fluorescence imaging.",Estimation;Three-dimensional displays;Microscopy;Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Europe;Signal processing;Depth estimation;integral imaging;orthographic views;depth from focus,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 26th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO),10.23919/EUSIPCO.2018.8553336
Significant Feature Extraction Automated Framework for Cancer Diagnosis from Bone Histopathology Images,"Osteosarcoma and Ewing Sarcoma most widely recognized primary bone tumor today. Due to tissue structure complexity there is limited research to explore for digital automation in histopathology field. Different parts of tissues in bone biopsy are depicted with osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. In these cells common malignant features are nuclear membrane irregularities, pleomorphism, multinucleated giant cells, hyperchromatic nuclei and abnormal mitoses. Aforesaid feature extraction to improve diagnosis accuracy is the prime objective of this study.

Analysis and Diagnosis of Erythemato-Squamous Diseases Using CHAID Decision Trees,"Erythemato-squamous diseases (ESDs) are common skin diseases. They consist of six different categories: psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, chronic dermatitis and pityriasis rubra pilaris. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling with very little differences. Their automatic detection is a challenging problem as they have overlapping signs and symptoms. This study evaluates the performance of CHAID decision trees (DTs) for the analysis and diagnosis of ESDs. DTs are nonparametric methods with no priori assumptions about the space distribution with the ability to generate understandable classification rules. This property makes them very efficient tools for physicians and medical specialists to understand the data and inspect the knowledge behind. The Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) decision tree model is a very fast model with the ability to build wider decision trees and to handle all kinds of input variables (features). The CHAID model has many successful achievements especially when used as an interpreter rather than a classifier. Due to the small number of samples, this study uses Chi-square test with the Likelihood Ratio (LR) to get robust results. Ensembles of bagged and boosted CHAIDs were introduced to improve the stability and the accuracy of the model, but on the expense of interpretability. This paper presents the experimental results of the application of CHAID decision trees and their bagged and boosted ensembles for the deferential diagnosis of ESD using both clinical and histopathological features. The prediction accuracies of these models are benchmarked against the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in terms of statistical accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, true positive rate, true negative rate and F-score.

Beyond the Pixel-Wise Loss for Topology-Aware Delineation,"Delineation of curvilinear structures is an important problem in Computer Vision with multiple practical applications. With the advent of Deep Learning, many current approaches on automatic delineation have focused on finding more powerful deep architectures, but have continued using the habitual pixel-wise losses such as binary cross-entropy. In this paper we claim that pixel-wise losses alone are unsuitable for this problem because of their inability to reflect the topological impact of mistakes in the final prediction. We propose a new loss term that is aware of the higher-order topological features of linear structures. We also exploit a refinement pipeline that iteratively applies the same model over the previous delineation to refine the predictions at each step, while keeping the number of parameters and the complexity of the model constant. When combined with the standard pixel-wise loss, both our new loss term and an iterative refinement boost the quality of the predicted delineations, in some cases almost doubling the accuracy as compared to the same classifier trained with the binary cross-entropy alone. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of data, from microscopy to aerial images.",Image segmentation;Topology;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Roads;Network topology;Standards,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/CVPR.2018.00331
Weakly Supervised Learning of Single-Cell Feature Embeddings,"We study the problem of learning representations for single cells in microscopy images to discover biological relationships between their experimental conditions. Many new applications in drug discovery and functional genomics require capturing the morphology of individual cells as comprehensively as possible. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn powerful visual representations, but require ground truth for training; this is rarely available in biomedical profiling experiments. While we do not know which experimental treatments produce cells that look alike, we do know that cells exposed to the same experimental treatment should generally look similar. Thus, we explore training CNNs using a weakly supervised approach that uses this information for feature learning. In addition, the training stage is regularized to control for unwanted variations using mixup or RNNs. We conduct experiments on two different datasets; the proposed approach yields single-cell embeddings that are more accurate than the widely adopted classical features, and are competitive with previously proposed transfer learning approaches.",Compounds;Feature extraction;Biology;Training;Sociology;Statistics;Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,10.1109/CVPR.2018.00970
Large Kernel Refine Fusion Net for Neuron Membrane Segmentation,"2D neuron membrane segmentation for Electron Microscopy (EM) images is a key step in the 3D neuron reconstruction task. Compared with the semantic segmentation tasks for general images, the boundary segmentation in EM images is more challenging. In EM segmentation tasks, we need not only to segment the ambiguous membrane boundaries from bubble-like noise in the images, but also to remove shadow-like intracellular structure. In order to address these problems, we propose a Large Kernel Refine Fusion Net, an encoder-decoder architecture with fusion of features at multiple resolution levels. We incorporate large convolutional blocks to ensure the valid receptive fields for the feature maps are large enough, which can reduce information loss. Our model can also process the background together with the membrane boundary by using residual cascade pooling blocks. In addition, the postprocessing method in our work is simple but effective for a final refinement of the output probability map.

Forest Species Recognition Based on Ensembles of Classifiers,"Recognition of forest species is a very challenging task thanks to the great intra-class variability. To cope with such a variability, we propose a multiple classifier system based on a two-level classification strategy and microscopic images. By using a divide-and-conquer approach, an image is first divided into several sub-images which are classified independently by each classifier. In a first fusion level, partial decisions for the sub-images are combined to generate a new partial decision for the original image. Then, the second fusion level combines all these new partial decisions to produce the final classification of the original image. To generate the pool of diverse classifiers, we used classical texture-based features as well as keypoint-based features. A series of experiments shows that the proposed strategy achieves compelling results. Compared to the best single classifier, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained with a keypoint based feature set, the divide-and-conquer strategy improves the recognition rate in about 4 and 6 percentage points in the first and second fusion levels, respectively.

Until now the process of recognizing white blood cell cancer or leukemia is still done conventionally, which method can cause a diagnosis difference if done by different medical personnel. To answer these problems, a desktop-based application will be built. This application is made to help the process of identification and classification of types of leukemia using the technique of processing microscopic images of human blood cells. By doing several approaches, such as pre-processing, using the median filtering method, conversion color (RGB to HSV) to clarify the blood image and tresholding to get the image pattern of blood cells that have. Segmentation will be carried out to separate between objects that will be taken with unnecessary objects. This system will use extracted form features from each cell in microscopic blood images. This feature retrieval will be used as a classifier input which is divided into two classification classes, namely Acute Lympotic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myolegenous Leukemia (AML). With this method an accuracy of 80% can be generated for the detection of ALL cells separately (one cell), 100% for AML detection separately (one cell) and 90% for cell detection throughout (many cells).",Blood;Diseases;Feature extraction;Cells (biology);Microscopy;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Leukemia;Microscopic;Image Processing;Human Blood Cells,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 International Conference on Applied Engineering (ICAE),10.1109/INCAE.2018.8579387

Harnessing AI for Kidney Glomeruli Classification,"A key challenge in renal diagnosis using digital pathology has been the scarcity of reliable annotated datasets that can act as a benchmark for histological investigations. This paper uses a novel medical image dataset, titled Glomeruli Classification Database (GCDB), consisting of renal glomeruli images bifurcated into binary classes of normal and abnormal morphology. Based on this dataset, we direct our pioneering efforts to explore suitable deep neural network techniques related to kidney tissue slide imaging so as to establish a state of the art in this relatively unexplored domain. The paper focuses on classifying normal and abnormal categories of glomeruli which are the vital blood filtration units of the kidney. The results obtained using publicly available transfer learning models are held in comparison with supervised classifiers configured with image features extracted from the last layers of pre-trained image classifiers. Contrary to popular belief, transfer learning models such as ResNet50 and InceptionV3 are empirically proved to under-perform for this particular task whereas the Logistic Regression model augmented with features from the InceptionResNetV2 show the most promising results on the GCDB dataset.","Feature extraction;Kidney;Biopsy;Biological system modeling;Histograms;Biomedical imaging;Logistics;Glomeruli Classification, Transfer Learning, Deep Neural Network, Renal Glomeruli",INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM),10.1109/ISM.2018.00011
Automated Detection and Quantification of Erythrocytes and Leukocytes from Giesma Stains of Blood Smear,"Automated differential blood quantification is a fundamental prerequisite for the development of a computer-assisted diagnostic system for microscopic hematology. Digitized images of Giesma stained blood smears enable ease of analysis due to cell coloration. Nevertheless cell clustering adversely affects detection making quantification a challenging task. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective technique for detection and quantification of erythrocytes and leukocytes from Giesma stained images of blood smears. Contrary to colour based segmentation, we split the RGB images into their constituent channels. Green channel is then enhanced using histogram equalization. A key step of our proposed technique is the use of different binarization schemes for erythrocyte and leukocyte detection. Cell clustering is then removed using morphological operations. Later contour based detection is used for cell localization and size based segmentation is employed for quantification. With enhanced preprocessing, our proposed scheme yielded 70% and 99% accuracies for erythrocyte and leukocyte quantification respectively.",Blood;Image segmentation;Histograms;Image edge detection;Transforms;Detectors;Sensitivity;erythrocytes;leukocytes;cell detection;cell quantification,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 14th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET),10.1109/ICET.2018.8603620
A Method for Automatic Tracking of Cell Nuclei in 2D Epifluorescence Microscopy Image Sequences,"The automated segmentation and tracking of cells in live cell microscopy image sequences is an actual problem in many biological research areas. Despite the existence of different cell tracking approaches, a universal solution for this problem still does not exist due to high variety of fluorescent microscopy image data obtained using different techniques, where cells have completely different visual appearance. Moreover, the cells can significantly change their shape even within a single image sequence. In this work, we propose a cell tracking algorithm designed for detecting and tracking cell nuclei in 2D image sequences obtained by epifluorescence microscopy, where the cell appearance drastically changes during cell mitosis. We used marker controlled watershed algorithm combined with blob detection for nuclei segmentation followed by a generalized nearest neighbor approach for nuclei tracking. We also employed a special mitosis detection algorithm to process cell division events. Our approach was quantitatively evaluated for its segmentation and tracking accuracy using the real image data annotated by human experts. The evaluation procedure was performed based on the protocol used in the Cell Tracking Challenge. It was shown that the proposed approach outperforms an existing semiautomatic method in both segmentation and tracking accuracy.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image sequences;Transforms;Shape;Detection algorithms;Tracking;Biomedical image analysis;cell tracking;mitosis detection.,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,"2018 Eighth International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)",10.1109/IPTA.2018.8608156
K-means and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis as segmentation algorithms of FTIR hyperspectral images collected from cutaneous tissue,"Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a rapid and label-free analytical technique whose potential as a diagnostic tool has been well demonstrated. The combination of spectroscopy and microscopy technologies enable wide-field scanning of a sample, providing a hyperspectral image with tens of thousands of spectra in a few minutes. In order to increase the information content of FTIR images, different clustering algorithms have been proposed as segmentation methods. However, systematic comparative tests of these techniques are still missing. Thus, the present paper aims to compare the ability of K-means Cluster Analysis (KMCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) as clustering algorithms to reconstruct FTIR hyperspectral images.

Identification of Cell Pathology by Using Stacked Auto-Encoders Combination with Rotation Forest,"Cytopathology is an effective method for obtaining pathological diagnosis in clinic.

An Effective Multi-classification Method for NHL Pathological Images,"Accurate classification on pathological images is a significant research focus such as for non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical classification model based on the labels' statistics for three NHL pathological images, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). First, each pathological image is converted onto the grayscale channel and then divided into 130 non-overlapped patches with 100100 pixels. Next, the sparse autoencoder (SAE), an unsupervised feature extraction method, is utilized to learn the representations of all patches and meanwhile texture features are extracted on these patches which are considered as the hand-craft features. Following this process, we can obtain a 680-dimension feature set. Finally, a hierarchical classification model trained by these 680-dimension features is applied to classify NHL as CLL, FL and MCL, where the label of each NHL pathological image is determined via the output labels of its 130 patches. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate the advantages of the proposed hierarchical classification model.",Pathology;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Image segmentation;Training;Cancer;Image color analysis;Lymphoma pathological images;Sparse autoencoder;Feature extraction;Hierarchical classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)",10.1109/SMC.2018.00138

Leukemia Prediction from Microscopic Images of Human Blood Cell Using HOG Feature Descriptor and Logistic Regression,"Leukemia originates in bone marrow. It massively affects the production of appropriate blood cells. Hence, its early detection is very crucial for human living. Generally, computational approaches for Leukemia detection use microscopic blood cells images. Then, machine learning based models are trained and tested for accurate measurement. The main challenge here is to achieve an acceptable accuracy with a scalable method. However, data inconsistency, missing values and data incompleteness made the researchers’ job much more difficult. In these consequences, this paper proposes a scalable Leukemia prediction method based on a publicly available ALL_IDB dataset using the HOG feature descriptor and Logistic Regression. Initially, the proposed method used Canny edge detector and noise reduction operators to detect the exact shape of Lymphocytes. Then, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the detected image shapes. The PCA reduces the data dimensions without losing any valuable information and thus greatly minimizes the afterward computational cost. Finally, a classifier based model is produced for unforeseen events and it is tested. The results are validated using n-fold cross-validation technique, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to three.

Cell Tracking Across Noisy Image Sequences Via Faster R-CNN and Dynamic Local Graph Matching,"Automated tracking of cells in time-lapse live-imaging datasets of developing multicellular tissues is gaining popularity in developmental biology for understanding the cell growth dynamics. The tracking of plant cells across noisy microscopy image sequences is very challenging, because plant cells in noisy region cannot be correctly segmented and cause serious errors in subsequent cell tracking procedure. In this paper, we present to track plant cells across noisy images using a tracking method which is based on Faster R-CNN and dynamic local graph matching. Faster R-CNN is employed to detect cells in noisy images, and it is improved by cell characteristic prior bounding box design and soft non-maximum suppression strategies. Then a dynamic local graph matching model is proposed to track the detected plant cells, by exploiting the cells' tight spatial and temporal contextual information. It tends to prevent the cell matching error accumulation by selecting the most similar cell pair in the dynamically growing neighbor set of matched cells. Compared with the existing tracking methods for plant cells, the experimental results show that the proposed method can greatly improve the tracking accuracy.",Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Noise measurement;Image segmentation;Proposals;Heuristic algorithms;Image sequences;Cell detection;Cell tracking;Faster R-CNN;Dynamic local graph matching,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621192
Context-Aware U-Net for Biomedical Image Segmentation,"Biomedical image segmentation is challenging for the lack of training data. U-Net has achieved good performance with small scale datasets through skip connections to merge features of low-level layers and high-level layers. However, it does not fully exploit the valuable contexts, which limits its segmentation performance. To enhance traditional U-Net not fully considering contextual information, we develop a context-aware U-Net, which aims to capture valuable contexts and improves the segmentation performance. Specially, we design a context transfer module that learns the rich contexts and produces context feature maps corresponding to input convolution feature maps. The proposed context transfer module is lightweight and it is easy to embed in any existing networks for image segmentation. In this paper, we present a context-aware U-Net with our context transfer module and conduct experiments to evaluate its performance on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks.

Also in counting the number of bacteria seen in the microscope because the tendency of it to accumulate together. In addition, manual counting of tuberculosis bacteria takes a lot of time, require high concentration and labor-intensive. We provide automated systems to distinguish between single and multiple tuberculosis bacteria and non-bacterial ones. The compared methods are backpropagation and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Sputum sample digital images are converted to HSV color channels. The bacterial length and bacterial endpoint is a feature that is extracted from tuberculosis bacteria.

The classification success of all these feature extraction algorithms has been examined separately. Then, all properties are combined to form a single property matrix. The obtained property matrix is reduced by using principal component analysis and relieff methods. New feature matrices provide increased classification performance. However, it is inefficient to classify a high number of properties in real-time applications. To overcome this problem, the effect of classifying each parameter in the property matrix is examined and the insignificant properties are discarded. The proposed method is tested using histopathological images. Histopathological images are divided into 4 separate classes. The proposed method reduces the raw feature matrix by 50% with 97.2% classification success.",Feature extraction;Optimization;Training;Principal component analysis;Classification algorithms;Real-time systems;Machine learning algorithms;feature extraction;classification;histopathological image;pca;relieff,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 International Symposium on Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering (ISFEE),10.1109/ISFEE.2018.8742479
A Machine Learning Technique for Drill Core Hyperspectral Data Analysis,"Hyperspectral data are increasingly being used to map minerals in drill core samples allowing a non-invasive and non-destructive characterization of the mineral assemblages, and therefore, the mineralogical composition of a system, its variability, and structural features. The analysis of drill core hyperspectral data is traditionally carried out by a visual interpretation of the spectra and a comparison with reference libraries using spectral similarity measures. Although this approach produces good results it is time-consuming and subjective. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, an innovative automatic mineral mapping technique for drill core hyperspectral data by using a machine learning approach. More specifically, we propose to exploit detailed information coming from the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)-based Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA) to train a supervised classifier. For the extraction of input features, a traditional technique is explored, i.e., Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For the classification step, we suggest to use Random Forest (RF) because of its significant performance when there are few training samples available. Experimental results conducted on a VNIR-SWIR drill core hyperspectral dataset, show accurate classification results.",Minerals;Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Training;Radio frequency;Drill core hyperspectral data;Mineral Liberation Analysis;Random Forest;mineral mapping,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,2018 9th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS),10.1109/WHISPERS.2018.8747022
Automatic Classification of Non Hodgkin‘s Lymphoma using Histological Images: Recent Advances and Directions,"Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer, whose around 80,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. It is generated in body's immune system cells like lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and other parts of the body. The timely detection of the exact type of lymphoma is necessary for the early treatment of patients and for their prognosis. The lymphoma can bediagnosed by performing lymph node biopsy followed by histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry methods. The histopathologic analysis is the most important diagnostic criteria which analyses the morphologic features of tumor under microscope using hematoxylin and eosinstained slides. Despite the analysis is carried out by expert hematologists and pathologist, the diagnosis is difficult due to various factors like requirement of human expertise, uncertainties, difference in staining of slides etc. The combination of image processing and machine learning techniques are emerging as the essential tool in various cancer detections tasks. These techniques have been employed by the researchers in classifying sub types of lymphoma CLL, MCL, FLL, whereas due to the complex features of these subtypes, the developed systems are not so efficient and progress is still going on to optimize different steps of lymphoma detection and classification. In this paper the existing work in past ten years has been analyzed and methodologies used in different steps are summarized. Paper is concluded with discussing the challenges and future directions for further improvement.",Feature extraction;Immune system;Machine learning;Cells (biology);Blood;Cancer;Lymphoma;CLL;MCL;FLL;Computer Vision;Feature Extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,"2018 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking (ICACCCN)",10.1109/ICACCCN.2018.8748489
OCT for non-destructive examination of the internal biological structures of mosquito specimen,"The Study of mosquitoes and their behavioral analysis are of crucial importance to control the alarmingly increasing mosquito-borne diseases. Conventional imaging techniques use either dissection, exogenous contrast agents. Non-destructive imaging techniques, like x-ray and microcomputed tomography uses ionizing radiations. Hence, a non-destructive and real-time imaging technique which can obtain high resolution images to study the anatomical features of mosquito specimen can greatly aid researchers for mosquito studies. In this study, the three-dimensional imaging capabilities of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for structural analysis of Anopheles sinensis mosquitoes has been demonstrated. The anatomical features of An. sinensis head, thorax, and abdomen regions along with internal morphological structures like foregut, midgut, and hindgut were studied using OCT imaging. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) OCT images along with histology images were helpful for the anatomical analysis of the mosquito specimens. From the concurred results and by exhibiting this as an initial study, the applicability of OCT in future entomological researches related to mosquitoes and changes in its anatomical structure is demonstrated.",Diseases;Optical coherence tomography;Optical sensors;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Head;optical coherence tomography;Anopheles sinensis;non-destructive imaging;internal morphological analysis.,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,"2018 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)",10.1109/EECSI.2018.8752659
Highway Driving Events Identification and Classification using Smartphone,"Research and developments in the newly emerging vehicular applications such as driving monitoring systems, driving behavior and style analysis, driving intension modeling and vehicle telematics, have greatly contributed in the fields of road safety analysis, intelligent transportation systems and microscopic traffic simulation for smart cities. Identification and classification of driving events represents a fundamental necessity for all these systems and in fact they represent the backbone module for any successful application. In recent years, the use of smartphones has grown significantly due to the increase in their computational capabilities and the integration of advanced sensor technologies. This prevalence of smartphones and advances in machine learning techniques have rapidly transformed the field of vehicular applications to be easily accessible, widely available, and implemented at low cost. This paper presents a simple but an effective approach for the identification and classification of driving events. The approach is based on separating events identification process from the classification process. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) technique is used for the identification, while statistical and time metrics features are used for the classification.

Colon Cancer Prediction On Different Magnified Colon Biopsy Images,"Colon Cancer detection is an important task for the histopathologist as they have to analyze morphology of the images at different magnifications thereby leading to intra and inter observer variability. Thus an automation is needed to detect the colon cancer for all the magnifications. This paper focus on the colon cancer detection on the colon biopsy images at different magnifications. First the images are converted to its HSV color space and further processing are performed on the saturation component. Features are the coefficients obtained from Dual-tree and double-density 2-D wavelet transform. In the last phase classification is performed with the Random Forest classifier.

Lactobacillus Bacterial Cell Segmentation Based on Marker Controlled Watershed Method,"A technique for the segmentation of Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) image of bacteria cells is proposed. There have been lots of efforts to replace the human eye inspection of biological data by automatic inspection. SEM image inspection is one of the major initiatives in this direction. Conventional biologist identify bacteria using colony morphology or by using bio-chemical approaches. However these approaches are tedious, time consuming and depends on the expertise of biologist. It is a complex task to segment SEM image of bacteria cells due to diversity of patterns, high level of noise content and variation in the image offset. In order to preserve the details at fine scales, marker controlled watershed is used, where markers are generated automatically this helps in limiting over segmentation. Experiment shows that method can accurately and quickly segment the bacteria cells.",Image segmentation;Microorganisms;Scanning electron microscopy;Feature extraction;Shape;Transforms;Automatic markers;morphological operators;segmentation;watershed,INPROCEEDINGS,2018,"2018 International Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Communication, Computer, and Optimization Techniques (ICEECCOT)",10.1109/ICEECCOT43722.2018.9001460
Survey of Mitosis Detection Techniques in Breast Cancer,"Breast Cancer is one of the most occurring cancer in women's among different types of cancer. Detection of mitosis is a challenging work in breast histopathology images and in mammography. Due to different stages of mitosis, non uniform stain illumination, size and shape variation of cells detection of mitosis is difficult. Different techniques and algorithms are used for detection of mitosis and non mitosis cells. Others additional techniques like fuzzy logic, neuro-fuzzy system, Artificial Neural Network, Convlutional Neural Network and classifiers also used for classification of malignant and non malignant cells based on learned features.

Segmentation of Vasculature From Fluorescently Labeled Endothelial Cells in Multi-Photon Microscopy Images,"Vasculature is known to be of key biological significance, especially in the study of tumors. As such, considerable effort has been focused on the automated segmentation of vasculature in medical and pre-clinical images. The majority of vascular segmentation methods focus on bloodpool labeling methods; however, particularly, in the study of tumors, it is of particular interest to be able to visualize both the perfused and the non-perfused vasculature. Imaging vasculature by highlighting the endothelium provides a way to separate the morphology of vasculature from the potentially confounding factor of perfusion. Here, we present a method for the segmentation of tumor vasculature in 3D fluorescence microscopic images using signals from the endothelial and surrounding cells. We show that our method can provide complete and semantically meaningful segmentations of complex vasculature using a supervoxel-Markov random field approach. We show that in terms of extracting meaningful segmentations of the vasculature, our method outperforms both state-of-the-art method, specific to these data, as well as more classical vasculature segmentation methods.",Image segmentation;Tumors;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Graphical models;Labeling;Image segmentation;Markov random fields;machine learning;microscopy,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2017.2725639
Bioimage Classification with Handcrafted and Learned Features,"Bioimage classification is increasingly becoming more important in many biological studies including those that require accurate cell phenotype recognition, subcellular localization, and histopathological classification. In this paper, we present a new General Purpose (GenP) bioimage classification method that can be applied to a large range of classification problems. The GenP system we propose is an ensemble that combines multiple texture features (both handcrafted and learned descriptors) for superior and generalizable discriminative power. Our ensemble obtains a boosting of performance by combining local features, dense sampling features, and deep learning features. Each descriptor is used to train a different Support Vector Machine that is then combined by sum rule. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of bioimage classification tasks each represented by a benchmark database, including some of those available in the IICBU 2008 database. Each bioimage classification task represents a typical subcellular, cellular, and tissue level classification problem. Our evaluation on these datasets demonstrates that the proposed GenP bioimage ensemble obtains state-of-the-art performance without any ad-hoc dataset tuning of the parameters (thereby avoiding any risk of overfitting/overtraining).

Label-Free Assessment of Premalignant Gastric Lesions Using Multimodal Nonlinear Optical Microscopy,"In this paper, a nonlinear optical microscopy employing two-photon excited fluorescence and second-harmonic generation was used for the detection of premalignant gastric lesions. It was found that gland morphology and collagen structure in mucosa will change with the progression of gastric diseases from normal to intestinal metaplasia, to low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and this microscopy was able to directly distinguish these warning symptoms. Furthermore, two features were quantified from nonlinear optical images to demonstrate the changes of gland size and collagen content during the development process of preneoplastic lesions. These results clearly show that nonlinear optical microscopy can effectively differentiate normal and precancerous gastric tissues without contrast agents, which would be helpful for early diagnosis and treatment of gastric diseases. This study may provide the groundwork for further application of nonlinear optical microscopy in clinical practice.",Glands;Optical imaging;Nonlinear optics;Optical harmonic generation;Neoplasms;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Nonlinear optical microscopy;gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM);low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN);high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN),ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/JSTQE.2018.2846018
Stokes-Correlometry Analysis of Biological Tissues With Polycrystalline Structure,"Utilizing Stokes-correlometry analysis a new diagnostic approach has been introduced for quantitative assessment of polarization images of histological sections of optically anisotropic biological tissues with different morphological structures and physiological conditions. The developed approach is based on the quantitative assessment of coordinate and phase distributions of the Stokes vector of scattered light. A combined use of statistic, correlation, and fractal analysis is used for resolving variations in optical anisotropy of biological samples. The proposed combined application of the statistical, correlation, and fractal-based evaluates of spatial distributions of `single-point' polarization azimuth, ellipticity, and `two-point' Stokes vector parameters of polarization images of biological tissues histological sections demonstrates a high accuracy (Ac ≥ 90%) in monitoring of optical anisotropy variations within biological tissues.",Optical polarization;Biomedical optical imaging;Geometrical optics;Optical imaging;Biological tissues;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Polarimetric imaging;polarization;ellipsometry and polarimetry;Stokes-correlometry,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/JSTQE.2018.2865443
3-D Quantification of Filopodia in Motile Cancer Cells,"We present a 3D bioimage analysis workflow to quantitatively analyze single, actin-stained cells with filopodial protrusions of diverse structural and temporal attributes, such as number, length, thickness, level of branching, and lifetime, in time-lapse confocal microscopy image data. Our workflow makes use of convolutional neural networks trained using real as well as synthetic image data, to segment the cell volumes with highly heterogeneous fluorescence intensity levels and to detect individual filopodial protrusions, followed by a constrained nearest-neighbor tracking algorithm to obtain valuable information about the spatio-temporal evolution of individual filopodia. We validated the workflow using real and synthetic 3-D time-lapse sequences of lung adenocarcinoma cells of three morphologically distinct filopodial phenotypes and show that it achieves reliable segmentation and tracking performance, providing a robust, reproducible and less time-consuming alternative to manual analysis of the 3D+t image data.",Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Biomedical imaging;Fluorescence;Manuals;Cancer;Microscopy;Filopodium segmentation and tracking;actin cytoskeleton;confocal microscopy;3D skeletonization;Chan-Vese model;convolutional neural network;deep learning,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2018.2873842
Simultaneous Cell Detection and Classification in Bone Marrow Histology Images,"Recently, deep learning frameworks have been shown to be successful and efficient in processing digital histology images for various detection and classification tasks. Among these tasks, cell detection and classification are key steps in many computer-assisted diagnosis systems. Traditionally, cell detection and classification is performed as a sequence of two consecutive steps by using two separate deep learning networks: one for detection and the other for classification. This strategy inevitably increases the computational complexity of the training stage. In this paper, we propose a synchronized deep autoencoder network for simultaneous detection and classification of cells in bone marrow histology images. The proposed network uses a single architecture to detect the positions of cells and classify the detected cells, in parallel. It uses a curvesupport Gaussian model to compute probability maps that allow detecting irregularly shape cells precisely. Moreover, the network includes a novel neighborhood selection mechanism to boost the classification accuracy. We show that the performance of the proposed network is superior than traditional deep learning detection methods and very competitive compared to traditional deep learning classification networks. Runtime comparison also shows that our network requires less time to be trained.",Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Bones;Feature extraction;Synchronization;Stem cells;Digital pathology;bone marrow trephine biopsy;deep learning;cell detection;cell classification,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2018.2878945
Densely-Connected Multi-Magnification Hashing for Histopathological Image Retrieval,"Content-based medical image retrieval is an important computer-aided diagnosis technique providing the clinicians with interpretative references based on visual similarity. In this paper, we focus on the tasks of histopathological image retrieval for breast cancer diagnosis. The densely-connected multi-magnification (DCMMH) framework is proposed to generate the discriminative binary codes by exploiting the histopathological images with multiple magnification factors. The low-magnification images are boosted by the accumulated similarity based on local patches that also regularize the feature learning of high-magnification images. In order to fully utilize the information across different magnification levels, a densely-connected architecture is finally deployed for high-low magnification pairs of datasets. Experiments on BreakHis dataset demonstrate that, DCMMH outperforms the previous hashing methods on histopathological image retrieval.",Image retrieval;Binary codes;Semantics;Visualization;Task analysis;Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Multi-magnification;content-based medical image retrieval;hashing,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2018.2882647
Crowdsourcing of Histological Image Labeling and Object Delineation by Medical Students,"Crowdsourcing in pathology has been performed on tasks that are assumed to be manageable by nonexperts. Demand remains high for annotations of more complex elements in digital microscopic images, such as anatomical structures. Therefore, this paper investigates conditions to enable crowdsourced annotations of high-level image objects, a complex task considered to require expert knowledge. Seventy six medical students without specific domain knowledge who voluntarily participated in three experiments solved two relevant annotation tasks on histopathological images: 1) labeling of images showing tissue regions and 2) delineation of morphologically defined image objects. We focus on methods to ensure sufficient annotation quality including several tests on the required number of participants and on the correlation of participants' performance between tasks. In a set up simulating annotation of images with limited ground truth, we validated the feasibility of a confidence score using full ground truth. For this, we computed a majority vote using weighting factors based on individual assessment of contributors against scattered gold standard annotated by pathologists. In conclusion, we provide guidance for task design and quality control to enable a crowdsourced approach to obtain accurate annotations required in the era of digital pathology.",Task analysis;Labeling;Tools;Crowdsourcing;Pathology;Biomedical imaging;Training;Crowdsourcing;human decision making;image classification;image delineation;digital pathology;annotation;confidence score;majority vote,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2018.2883237
Automatic Graph-Based Modeling of Brain Microvessels Captured With Two-Photon Microscopy,"Graph models of cerebral vasculature derived from two-photon microscopy have shown to be relevant to study brain microphysiology. Automatic graphing of these microvessels remain problematic due to the vascular network complexity and two-photon sensitivity limitations with depth. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic processing pipeline to address this issue. The modeling scheme consists of a fully-convolution neural network to segment microvessels, a three-dimensional surface model generator, and a geometry contraction algorithm to produce graphical models with a single connected component. Based on a quantitative assessment using NetMets metrics, at a tolerance of 60 μm, false negative and false positive geometric error 19 rates are 3.8% and 4.2%, respectively, whereas false nega20 tive and false positive topological error rates are 6.1% and 4.5%, respectively.

Pre-Clinical Translation of Second Harmonic Microscopy of Meniscal and Articular Cartilage Using a Prototype Nonlinear Microendoscope,"Previous studies using nonlinear microscopy have demonstrated that osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the gradual replacement of Type II collagen with Type I collagen. The objective of this study was to develop a prototype nonlinear laser scanning microendoscope capable of resolving the structural differences of collagen in various orthopaedically relevant cartilaginous surfaces. The current prototype developed a miniaturized femtosecond laser scanning instrument, mounted on an articulated positioning system, capable of both conventional arthroscopy and second-harmonic laser-scanning microscopy. Its optical system includes a multi-resolution optical system using a gradient index objective lens and a customized multi-purpose fiber optic sheath to maximize the collection of backscattered photons or provide joint capsule illumination. The stability and suitability of the prototype arthroscope to approach and image cartilage were evaluated through preliminary testing on fresh, minimally processed, and partially intact porcine knee joints. Image quality was sufficient to distinguish between hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage through unique Type I and Type II collagen-specific characteristics. Imaging the meniscus revealed that the system was able to visualize differences in the collagen arrangement between the superficial and lamellar layers. Such detailed in vivo imaging of the cartilage surfaces could obviate the need to perform biopsies for ex vivo histological analysis in the future, and provide an alternative to conventional external imaging to characterize and diagnose progressive and degenerative cartilage diseases such as OA. Moreover, this system is readily customizable and may provide a suitable and modular platform for developing additional tools utilizing femtosecond lasers for tissue cutting within the familiar confines of two or three portal arthroscopy techniques.",Microscopy;Optical fibers;Prototypes;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Fiber nonlinear optics;Arthroscopy;cartilage;collagen;diagnostics;histology;microscopy;orthopaedics;osteoarthritis;second harmonic imaging;surgical assist devices,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2889496
A Framework Linking Glycolytic Metabolic Capabilities and Tumor Dynamics,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. The main aim of this paper is to integrate a genomescale metabolic description of tumor cells into a tumor growth model that accounts for the spatiotemporally heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, in order to study the effects of microscopic characteristics on tumor evolution. A lactate maximization metabolic strategy that allows nearoptimal growth solution, while maximizing lactate secretion, is assumed. The proposed sub-cellular metabolic model is then incorporated into a hybrid discrete-continuous model of tumor growth. We produced several phenotypes by applying different constraints and optimization criteria in the metabolic model and explored the tumor evolution of the various phenotypes in different vasculature conditions and extracellular matrix densities. At first, we showed that the metabolic capabilities of phenotypes depending on resource availability can vary in a counter-intuitive manner. We then showed that: first, tumor population, morphology, and spread are affected differently in different conditions, allowing thus phenotypes to be superior than others in different conditions; and second, polyclonal tumors consisting of different phenotypes can exploit their different metabolic capabilities to enhance further tumor evolution. The proposed framework comprises a proof-of-concept demonstration showing the importance of considering the metabolic capabilities of phenotypes on predicting tumor evolution. The proposed framework allows the incorporation of context-specific and patient-specific data for the study of personalized tumor evolution and therapy efficacy, linking genome to metabolic capabilities and tumor dynamics.",Tumors;Biochemistry;Cancer;Evolution (biology);Genomics;Bioinformatics;Mathematical model;Aerobic glycolysis;agent-based modeling;cancer metabolism;genome-scale modeling;lactate-facilitated movement;metabolic flux modeling;multi-scale modeling;patient-specific modeling;tumor growth modeling,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2018.2890708
Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Label-Free 3-D Optical Coherence Microscopy Images of Human Cervical Tissue,"Objective: Ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence microscopy (OCM) has recently demonstrated its potential for accurate diagnosis of human cervical diseases. One major challenge for clinical adoption, however, is the steep learning curve clinicians need to overcome to interpret OCM images. Developing an intelligent technique for computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) to accurately interpret OCM images will facilitate clinical adoption of the technology and improve patient care. Methods: 497 high-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) OCM volumes (600 cross-sectional images each) were collected from 159 ex vivo specimens of 92 female patients. OCM image features were extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, concatenated with patient information [e.g., age and human papillomavirus (HPV) results], and classified using a support vector machine classifier. Ten-fold cross-validations were utilized to test the performance of the CADx method in a five-class classification task and a binary classification task. Results: An 88.3 ± 4.9% classification accuracy was achieved for five fine-grained classes of cervical tissue, namely normal, ectropion, low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL), and cancer. In the binary classification task [low-risk (normal, ectropion, and LSIL) versus high-risk (HSIL and cancer)], the CADx method achieved an area-under-the-curve value of 0.959 with an 86.7 ± 11.4% sensitivity and 93.5 ± 3.8% specificity. Conclusion: The proposed deep-learning-based CADx method outperformed four human experts. It was also able to identify morphological characteristics in OCM images that were consistent with histopathological interpretations. Significance: Label-free OCM imaging, combined with deep-learning-based CADx methods, holds a great promise to be used in clinical settings for the effective screening and diagnosis of cervical diseases.",Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Lesions;Cervical cancer;Cervical cancer;optical coherence tomography;optical coherence microscopy;deep learning;computer-aided diagnosis,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2018.2890167
Heterogeneity-Aware Local Binary Patterns for Retrieval of Histopathology Images,"Histopathology images exhibit considerable variability, which can make diagnosis prone to uncertainty and errors. Using retrieval systems to locate similar images when a query image is given can assist pathologists in making more reliable decisions when diagnosing, based on accurately diagnosed past cases. Local binary patterns (LBP) have been successfully used as image descriptors for different applications. However, using LBP on histopathology images is still under investigation from different perspectives. The immense texture variability of these images and the lack of labeled training data are among the challenges that must be addressed. In this paper, we propose a new extension of LBP that is explicitly aware of the heterogeneity of local texture patterns through heterogeneity-based weighting. We use both homogeneity and the second moment (variance) of local neighborhoods to extend LBP histograms with heterogeneity information so that they better capture the polymorphism in histopathology images. We applied all concepts at multiple scales and investigated the extensions through both separated and concatenated extended histograms. We applied the proposed method on three publicly available datasets, namely, KimiaPath24, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and BreakHis. The experimental results revealed that our features could retrieve and classify images with the highest accuracy. For KimiaPath24, we achieved 96.4% surpassing both LBP (91.0%) and deep features from VGG network (79.5%). For IDC, we reached the highest F1 measure (0.7665). Only for BreakHis, the proposed method was slightly less accurate than a customized convolutional neural network with rule fusion.",Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Histograms;Image retrieval;Support vector machines;Image segmentation;Biological tissues;Content based image retrieval (CBIR);whole slide image (WSI) processing;heterogeneity mask;local binary pattern (LBP),ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2897281
A Global Method for Non-Rigid Registration of Cell Nuclei in Live Cell Time-Lapse Images,"Non-rigid registration of cell nuclei in time-lapse microscopy images can be achieved through estimating the deformation fields using optical flow methods. In contrast to local optical flow models employed in the existing non-rigid registration methods, we introduce approaches based on a global optical flow model. Our registration model consists of a data fidelity term and a regularization term. We compared different regularizers for the deformation fields and found that a convex quadratic function is more suitable than non-convex ones. To improve the robustness, we propose an adaptive weighting scheme based on the statistics of the noise in fluorescence microscopy images as well as a combined local-global scheme. Moreover, we extend the global method by exploiting high-order image features. The best suitable high-order features are determined through learning two generative image models, namely, fields of experts and convolutional Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine, whose model formulations are both consistent with the assumption of high-order feature constancy in the registration model. Using multiple data sets of real 2D and 3D live cell microscopy image sequences as well as synthetic image data, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous methods in terms of both registration accuracy and computational efficiency.",Optical imaging;Biomedical optical imaging;Strain;Microscopy;Computational modeling;Optical microscopy;Optical scattering;Non-rigid registration;optical flow;regularization;fluorescence microscopy images;restricted Boltzmann machine;Markov random field,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2019.2901918

Joint Image Deconvolution and Separation Using Mixed Dictionaries,"The task of separating an image into distinct components that represent different features plays an important role in many applications. Traditionally, such separation techniques are applied once the image in question has been reconstructed from measured data. We propose an efficient iterative algorithm, where reconstruction is performed jointly with the task of separation. A key assumption is that the image components have different sparse representations. The algorithm is based on a scheme that minimizes a functional composed of a data discrepancy term and the l1-norm of the coefficients of the different components with respect to their corresponding dictionaries. The performance is demonstrated for joint 2D deconvolution and separation into curve- and point-like components, and tests are performed on synthetic data as well as experimental stimulated emission depletion and confocal microscopy data.

Exploring Classification of Histological Disease Biomarkers From Renal Biopsy Images,"Identification of diseased kidney glomeruli and fibrotic regions remains subjective and time-consuming due to complete dependence on an expert kidney pathologist. In an attempt to automate the classification of glomeruli into normal and abnormal morphology and classification of fibrosis patches into mild, moderate and severe categories, we investigate three deep learning techniques: traditional transfer learning, pre-trained deep neural networks for feature extraction followed by supervised classification, and a novel Multi-Gaze Attention Network (MGANet) that uses multi-headed self-attention through parallel residual skip connections in a CNN architecture. Emperically, while the transfer learning models such as ResNet50, InceptionResNetV2, VGG19 and InceptionV3 acutely under-perform in the classification tasks, the Logistic Regression model augmented with features extracted from the InceptionResNetV2 shows promising results. Additionally, the experiments effectively ascertain that the proposed MGANet architecture outperforms both the former baseline techniques to establish the state of the art accuracy of 87.25% and 81.47% for glomerluli and fibrosis classification, respectively on the Renal Glomeruli Fibrosis Histopathological (RGFH) database.",Kidney;Feature extraction;Databases;Biopsy;Diseases;Medical diagnostic imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV),10.1109/WACV.2019.00016
Image preprocessing to improve Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) detection in smear microscopy to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis,"Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious disease. TB is curable if it is diagnosed opportunely. Worldwide, the most used diagnostic method is the analysis of smear microscopy, which consists in, using a microscope, detecting and counting the bacilli in the smear. The automatic detection of pulmonary tuberculosis usually involves processing and analyzing digital images related to smear microscopy. The main problem in this analysis is the color variation and low contrast in the images. This paper presents a quick and easy method to minimize these variations by using image preprocessing, changing the RGB color space to the HSV space, analyzing and modifying the original images characteristics to standardize them. The results are validated by using a further segmentation step of the images using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and comparing the results obtained with and without the image preprocessing method.",Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Digital images;Image capture;Artificial neural networks;Laboratories;Mycobacterium tuberculosis;Diagnostic;Image preprocessing;Smear microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,"2019 International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP)",10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2019.8673181
Computer-assisted Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia detection and diagnosis,"Leukemia is a cancer of white blood cells (WBCs) which damages blood and bone marrow of human body. It can be fatal disease if not diagnose at earlier stage. Generally complete blood count (CBC) or morphological image analysis is used to manually diagnose the leukemia cells. These methods are time consuming and less accurate which needs to be fixed. In this paper we have proposed an automated technique for the detection of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by microscopic blood image analysis. This approach first segment out the different types of cells from the image i-e. white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. After that Lymphocytes are separated from the white blood cells. Then shape and color features are extracted from these lymphocytes which are given to SVM classifier to classify the cells into normal and blast. We have achieved an overall accuracy of 93.7%, senstivity of 92% and specificity of 91% by testing our proposed algorithm over the ALL-IDB-1 dataset. This automated leukemia detection system found to be more effective, fast and accurate as compare to manual diagnosing methods.",Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Shape;Support vector machines;White blood cells;Cells (biology);acute leukemia detection;image processing;lymphocytes;medical image analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,"2019 2nd International Conference on Communication, Computing and Digital systems (C-CODE)",10.1109/C-CODE.2019.8680972
Narrow Gap Detection in Microscope Images Using Marked Point Process Modeling,"Differentiating objects separated by narrow gaps is a challenging and important task in analyzing microscopic images. These small separations provide useful information for applications that require detailed boundary information and/or an accurate particle count. We present a new approach to the modeling of these gaps based on a marked point process (MPP) framework. We propose to model narrow gaps as geometric structures called channels and define Gibbs energies for these models. The reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm embedded with simulated annealing is used as an optimization method, and the switching kernel in an RJMCMC is newly designed to speed up the algorithm. In this paper, we also propose a method to exploit a detected channel configuration to reduce bridging channel defects in conventional segmentation algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed channel modeling methods are successful in detecting gaps between closely adjacent objects. The results also show that the proposed interaction parameter control method improves boundary precision in the segmentation of microscopic images. The implementation of this method is available at https://engineering.purdue.edu/MASSI.",Image segmentation;Microscopy;Channel models;Shape;Markov processes;Task analysis;Monte Carlo methods;MPP;narrow gap detection;RJMCMC;segmentation,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2019.2910389
Segmentation of Overlapping Cytoplasm in Cervical Smear Images via Adaptive Shape Priors Extracted From Contour Fragments,"We present a novel approach for segmenting overlapping cytoplasm of cells in cervical smear images by leveraging the adaptive shape priors extracted from cytoplasm's contour fragments and shape statistics. The main challenge of this task is that many occluded boundaries in cytoplasm clumps are extremely difficult to be identified and, sometimes, even visually indistinguishable. Given a clump where multiple cytoplasms overlap, our method starts by cutting its contour into a set of contour fragments. We then locate the corresponding contour fragments of each cytoplasm by a grouping process. For each cytoplasm, according to the grouped fragments and a set of known shape references, we construct its shape and, then, connect the fragments to form a closed contour as the segmentation result, which is explicitly constrained by the constructed shape. We further integrate the intensity and curvature information, which is complementary to the shape priors extracted from contour fragments, into our framework to improve the segmentation accuracy. We propose to iteratively conduct fragments grouping, shape constructing, and fragments connecting for progressively refining the shape priors and improving the segmentation results. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two typical cervical smear datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach is highly effective and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method is general enough to be applied to other similar microscopic image segmentation tasks, where heavily overlapped objects exist.",Shape;Image segmentation;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Cervical cancer;Level set;Overlapping cytoplasm segmentation;contour fragments;fragments grouping and connecting;automatic cervical cancer screening,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2019.2915633
Cell-Net: Embryonic Cell Counting and Centroid Localization via Residual Incremental Atrous Pyramid and Progressive Upsampling Convolution,"In-vitro fertilization (IVF), as the most common fertility treatment, has never reached its maximum potentials. Systematic selection of embryos with the highest implementation potentials is a necessary step toward enhancing the effectiveness of IVF. Embryonic cell numbers and their developmental rate are believed to correlate with the embryo's implantation potentials. In this paper, we propose an automatic framework based on a deep convolutional neural network to take on the challenging task of automatic counting and centroid localization of embryonic cells (blastomeres) in microscopic human embryo images. In particular, the cell counting task is reformulated as an end-to-end regression problem that is based on a shape-aware Gaussian dot annotation to map the input image into an output density map. The proposed Cell-Net system incorporates two novel components, residual incremental Atrous pyramid, and progressive up-sampling convolution. The residual incremental Atrous pyramid enables the network to extract rich global contextual information without raising the `grinding' issue. Progressive up-sampling convolution gradually reconstructs a high-resolution feature map by taking into account short- and long-range dependencies. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework is capable of predicting the cell-stage and detecting blastomeres in embryo images of 1-8 cell by mean accuracies of 86.1% and 95.1%, respectively.",Embryo;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Task analysis;Convolution;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Cell counting;human embryonic cells;IVF;medical image analysis;deep learning,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920933

Textural feature extraction and multiple instance learning for cell segmantation in histopathological images,"Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a learning approach which is based on classification of bags of instances, as opposed to the traditional supervised learning paradigm. Multiple instance learning provides a natural way for modelling some pattern recognition problems which naturally have ambiguity such as object recognition, image and text classification. In addition, multiple instance learning paradigm gives more accurate results for those problems than traditional supervised learning paradigm does. In this study, we have applied multiple instance learning paradigm to cell segmentation problem in histopathological images by employing the intensity values in color space and textural information of pixels as features. Furthermore, to increase segmantation accuracy, we aimed to improve the results of pre-segmentation by implementing Markov random fields (MRF) method in the post processing step. Then, we presented the promising results in tables comparatively.",Supervised learning;Image segmentation;Markov random fields;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Object recognition;Multiple Instance Learning;Cell Segmentation;Markov Random Fields;Histopathological Images,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 Scientific Meeting on Electrical-Electronics & Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science (EBBT),10.1109/EBBT.2019.8741762
Digital Holographic Microscope Trades for Extant Life Detection Applications,"Optical microscopy is one of the key technologies needed for detection of extant life on other solar system bodies. Microscopic images can be used to identify the presence of cell-like objects and discriminate probable cells from other abiotic particles of similar scale through observations of morphology. Image sequences can be used to determine particle density through observation of Brownian motion, enabling discrimination of liquid-filled vesicles from solid mineral grains; non- Brownian motion that is also inconsistent with background flow can also indicate biotic particles. Phase-sensitive imaging modes allow measurement of index of refraction and can be used to image transparent cells that might otherwise require the addition of stains. Because of the likely limited energy available for replication on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, potential unicellular life would likely be present only at very low concentrations requiring a search through substantial volumes of material at very high resolution. We have been developing digital holographic microscopes (DHM) that addresses the need for high resolution search at low concentrations. Our DHM designs provide both the sub micrometer resolution necessary to detect the smallest forms of life and the high throughput needed to do so at very low concentrations. A significant feature of the holographic recording is that all objects in a large volume can be recorded simultaneously, without the need for focus or tracking to image individual objects. We have demonstrated two promising DHM architectures for possible use in potential future life detection missions - one using conventional optics and one using gradient index optics in a “lensless” arrangement. We compare the two designs, their trade spaces, and the features that might make each preferable for specific applications.",Microscopy;Optical imaging;Detectors;Optical sensors;Image resolution;Optical microscopy;Laser beams,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference,10.1109/AERO.2019.8742111
Cervical Histopathology Image Classification Using Multilayer Hidden Conditional Random Fields and Weakly Supervised Learning,"In this paper, a novel multilayer hidden conditional random fields (MHCRFs)-based cervical histopathology image classification (CHIC) model is proposed to classify well, moderate and poorly differentiation stages of cervical cancer using a weakly supervised learning strategy. First, the color, texture, and deep learning features are extracted to represent the histopathological image patches. Then, based on the extracted features, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and random forest classifiers are designed to calculate the patch-level classification probabilities. Third, effective classifiers are selected to generate unary and binary potentials. At last, using the generated potentials, the final image-level classification results are predicted by our MHCRF model, and an overall accuracy around 77.32% is obtained on six practical cervical histopathological image datasets with more than 600 immunohistochemical (IHC) stained samples. Among the six test accuracies, the highest reaches 88%. Furthermore, we also test our MHCRF method with a gastric hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained histopathological image dataset including 200 images for an extended experiment, and achieve an accuracy of 93%.",Feature extraction;Cervical cancer;Image color analysis;Histograms;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Cervical cancer;conditional random fields;deep learning;feature extraction;histopathological image;weakly supervised learning,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924467
Dual U-Net for the Segmentation of Overlapping Glioma Nuclei,"The morphology and surroundings of cells have been routinely used by pathologists to diagnose the pathological subtypes of gliomas and to assess the malignancy of tumors. Thanks to the advent and development of digital pathology technology, it is possible to automatically analyze whole slides of tissue and focus on the nucleus in order to derive a quantitative assessment that can be used for grading, classification, and diagnosis. During the process of computer-assisted diagnosis, the accurate location and segmentation of nuclei from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histopathological images is an important step. In this paper, we proposed a U-Net-based multi-task learning network in which the boundary and region information is utilized to improve the segmentation accuracy of glioma nuclei, especially overlapping ones. To refine the segmentation, a classification model is used to predict the boundary, a regression model is used to predict the distance map, and the final segmentation is obtained by using the fusion layers. The proposed approach was compared with other specially designed boundary-aware methods by using a pathological section dataset that consists of 320 glioma cases from the Huashan Hospital at Fudan University. Both the pixel-level and object-level evaluations showed that the structural modification is effective in segmentation with an F1-score of 0.82, a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 3.95, and an aggregated Jaccard index (AJI) of 0.66 (+0.46%, -3.75%, and +4.09% compared with the unimproved methods, respectively). In addition, comparative experiments on multi-organ nuclei segmentation (MoNuSeg) open dataset proved the advanced nature of the proposed method in the field of nuclei segmentation, especially separating touching objects.

Joint Segmentation and Fine-Grained Classification of Nuclei in Histopathology Images,"Nuclei segmentation and classification are two important tasks in the histopathology image analysis, because the morphological features of nuclei and spatial distributions of different types of nuclei are highly related to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Existing methods handle the two problems independently, which are not able to obtain the features and spatial heterogeneity of different types of nuclei at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based method which solves both tasks in a unified framework. It can segment individual nuclei and classify them into tumor, lymphocyte and stroma nuclei. Perceptual loss is utilized to enhance the segmentation of details. We also take advantages of transfer learning to promote the training of deep neural networks on a relatively small lung cancer dataset. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Combining Nonparametric Spatial Context Priors With Nonparametric Shape Priors for Dendritic Spine Segmentation in 2-Photon Microscopy Images,"Data driven segmentation is an important initial step of shape prior-based segmentation methods since it is assumed that the data term brings a curve to a plausible level so that shape and data terms can then work together to produce better segmentations. When purely data driven segmentation produces poor results, the final segmentation is generally affected adversely. One challenge faced by many existing data terms is due to the fact that they consider only pixel intensities to decide whether to assign a pixel to the foreground or to the background region. When the distributions of the foreground and back-ground pixel intensities have significant overlap, such data terms become ineffective, as they produce uncertain results for many pixels in a test image. In such cases, using prior information about the spatial context of the object to be segmented together with the data term can bring a curve to a plausible stage, which would then serve as a good initial point to launch shape-based segmentation. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation approach that combines nonparametric context priors with a learned-intensity-based data term and nonparametric shape priors. We perform experiments for dendritic spine segmentation in both 2 D and 3 D 2-photon microscopy images. The experimental results demonstrate that using spatial context priors leads to significant improvements.",Image segmentation;Shape;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Training;Probability density function;Level set;Nonparametric shape priors;spatial context priors;spine segmentation;2-photon microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019),10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759273
Deforming Tessellations For The Segmentation Of Cell Aggregates,"We present a new active contour to segment cell aggregates. We describe it by a smooth tessellation that is attracted toward the cell membranes. Our approach relies on subdivision schemes that are tightly linked to the theory of wavelets. The shape is encoded by control points grouped in tiles. The smooth and continuously defined boundary of each tile is generated by recursively applying a refinement process to its control points. We deform the smooth tessellation in a global manner using a ridge-based energy that we have designed for that purpose. By construction, cells are segmented without overlap and the tessellation structure is maintained even on dim membranes. Leakage, which afflicts usual image-processing methods (e.g., watershed), is thus prevented. We validate our framework on both synthetic and real microscopy images, showing that the proposed method is robust to membrane gaps and to high levels of noise.",Active contours;Biomembranes;Image segmentation;Aggregates;Tiles;Indexes;Optimization;Active contour;C. elegans;cell aggregate;Deslauriers-Dubuc;segmentation;subdivision;tessellation,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019),10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759311
Automated Segmentation Of Cervical Nuclei In Pap Smear Images Using Deformable Multi-Path Ensemble Model,"Pap smear testing has been widely used for detecting cervical cancers based on the morphological properties of cell nuclei in microscopic image. An accurate nuclei segmentation could thus improve the success rate of cervical cancer screening. In this work, a method of automated cervical nuclei segmentation using Deformable Multipath Ensemble Model (D-MEM) is proposed. The approach adopts a U-shaped convolutional network as a backbone network, in which dense blocks are used to transfer feature information more effectively. To increase the flexibility of the model, we then use deformable convolution to deal with different nuclei irregular shapes and sizes. To reduce the predictive bias, we further construct multiple networks with different settings, which form an ensemble model.

Automated Quantification of Amyloid Fibrils Morphological Features by Image Processing Techniques,"Image analysis of protein fibrils is a key step for a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms responsible for aggregation and deposition of amyloids. In this paper, we develop a fully automated method to detect and measure all characteristics of fibrils. After detecting the fibrils centerline, we propose a tracking-based method to estimate the local width, length and curvature of fibrils. We also discriminate between branches and overlapping of fibrils by comparing the orientations of the fibril segments at their intersection point. We test our method on Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images of human, bank vole, and ovine PrP (prion protein) fibrils, and analyze the result to evidence structural differences between different types of fibrils.

Efficient Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histology Images by RCNN,"Mitotic cell detection and counting per tissue area is an important aggressiveness indicator for the invasive breast cancer. However, manual mitosis counting by pathologists is extremely labor-intensive. Several automatic mitosis detection methods have been proposed in recent years. Traditional methods using hand-crafted features suffer from large mitotic cell shape variation and the existence of many mimics with similar appearance. Pixel-wise classification working in a sliding window manner is time-consuming which hinders it from clinical application. In this work, we propose an efficient mitosis detection method in breast cancer histology images by applying modified regional convolutional neural network (RCNN). Our method achieves 0.76 in precision, 0.72 recall and 0.736 F1 score on MICCAI TUPAC 2016 datasets, outperforming all the previously published results as far as we know. F1 score of 0.585 is also achieved on ICPR 2014 mitosis dataset. TUPAC 2016 and ICPR 2014 datasets are cross validated without and with color normalization to study the generalization performance.

Segmentation And Modelling of Helanuclear Envelope,"This paper describes an algorithm to segment the 3D nuclear envelope of HeLa cancer cells from electron microscopy images and model the volumetric shape of the nuclear envelope against an ellipsoid. The algorithm was trained on a single cell and then tested in six separate cells. To assess the algorithm, Jaccard similarity index and Hausdorff distance against a manually-delineated gold standard were calculated on two cells. The mean Jaccard value and Hausdorff distance that the segmentation achieved for central slices were 98% and 4 pixels for the first cell and 94% and 13 pixels for the second cell and outperformed segmentation with active contours. The modelling projects a 3D to a 2D surface that summarises the complexity of the shape in an intuitive result. Measurements extracted from the modelled surface may be useful to correlate shape with biological characteristics. The algorithm is unsupervised, fully automatic, fast and processes one image in less than 10 seconds.

Transfer Learning from Nucleus Detection to Classification in Histopathology Images,"Despite significant recent success, modern computer vision techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are expensive to apply to cell-level prediction problems in histopathology images due to difficulties in providing celllevel supervision. This work explores the transferability of features learned by an object detection CNN (Faster R-CNN) to nucleus classification in histopathology images. We detect nuclei in these images using class-agnostic models trained on small annotated patches, and use the CNN representations of detected nuclei to cluster and classify them.

Towards the Identification of Histology Based Subtypes in Prostate Cancer,"With the advent of deep neural networks (DNNs), methods of semantic segmentation in histology have improved to a degree that it now possible to analyse morphological features that are not easily accessible to human interpretation. Such features may be used to stratify tissue subtypes in health and disease. A major obstacle is that DNNs require a large amount of data to achieve high performance and generalise to new patients. Such a requirement is unsuitable for exploratory investigations that only have access to small patient cohorts. In this work, we demonstrate how variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks can be combined to generate realistic histology images suitable for training semantic segmentation models, resulting in a novel data-augmentation method for histology. Subsequently, we analyse if such models can be used to identify subpopulations of prostate glands with different molecular profiles. If successful, this development will ultimately lead to the discovery of novel disease relevant histology-based subtypes. We demonstrate that morphological features derived from the H&E images alone are sufficient to identify expression of a clinical biomarker in prostate glands.",Glands;Image segmentation;Decoding;Feature extraction;Shape;Proteins;Training;Digital Histopathology;Prostate gland segmentation;Data Augmentation;VAE;GAN;Morpho-molecular Pathology;Cytokeratin 5,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019),10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759199
A State-of-the-Art Survey for Microorganism Image Segmentation Methods and Future Potential,"Microorganisms play a great role in ecosystem, wastewater treatment, monitoring of environmental changes, and decomposition of waste materials. However, some of them are harmful to humans and animals such as tuberculosis bacteria and plasmodium. In such course, it is important to identify, track, analyze, consider the beneficial side and get rid of the negative effects of microorganisms using fast, accurate, and reliable methods. In recent decades, image analysis techniques have been used to address the drawbacks of manual traditional approaches in the identification and analysis of microorganisms. As image segmentation being an important step (technique) in the detection, tracking, monitoring, feature extraction, modeling, and analysis of microorganisms, different methods have been deployed, from classical approaches to current deep neural networks upon different challenges on microorganism images.

Lensless Digital in-Line Holographic Microscopy for Space Biotechnology Applications,"Biomechanical changes at cellular level can dramatically affect living organisms in both aviation and space applications. Weightlessness induces morphological alteration of cells, which leads to tissue loss. Therefore, scientists have been studying the effect of weightlessness using cell culture based biological experiments using conventional microscopes. However, strict requirements regarding cost, weight and functionality limit the use of conventional microscopes in space environment. Lensless digital in-line holographic microscopy enables to use low-weight, low-cost and robust elements, such as a light emitting diode (LED), an aperture and an imaging sensor, instead of bulky, expensive and fragile optical elements, such as lenses, mirrors and filters. This technology offers a high field of view compared to conventional microscopes without affecting the resolution and it is also suitable for remote sensing applications with automated imaging capabilities. Here, we present a portable digital in-line holographic microscopy platform that allows to visualize cells and to analyze their viability in a microfluidic chip.

A Method of Automatically Calculating Vaginal Cleanliness Degree from Leukorrhoea's Microscope Images,"Vaginal cleanliness degree is one of the most important diagnosis criteria in regular examination of leucorrhea. It can be used to judge whether inflammation occurs. The most common clinical way to obtain vaginal cleanliness degree is manual microscopic examination. In current research, some groups have already proposed some methods to automatically analyse images from microscopic examination of leucorrhea secretion. But none of these methods can recognize four important targets at the same time, so they can't obtain the vaginal cleanliness degree. This paper reports about a method that can automatically calculate the vaginal cleanliness degree of a microscopic examination image. This method includes a convolutional network similar to fully convolutional networks, and some morphological operations to extract contour of each cell and count their number. Experiments prove that our algorithm is simple, fast, efficient and accurate.

Visualizing Structures in Confocal Microscopy Datasets Through Clusterization: A Case Study on Bile Ducts,"Three-dimensional datasets from biological tissues have increased with the evolution of confocal microscopy. Hepatology researchers have used confocal microscopy for investigating the microanatomy of bile ducts. Bile ducts are complex tubular tissues consisting of many juxtaposed microstructures with distinct characteristics. Since confocal images are difficult to segment because of the noise introduced during the specimen preparation, traditional quantitative analyses used in medical datasets are difficult to perform on confocal microscopy data and require extensive user intervention. Thus, the visual exploration and analysis of bile ducts pose a challenge in hepatology research, requiring different methods. This paper investigates the application of unsupervised machine learning to extract relevant structures from confocal microscopy datasets representing bile ducts. Our approach consists of pre-processing, clustering, and 3D visualization. For clustering, we explore the density-based spatial clustering for applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, using gradient information for guiding the clustering. We obtained a better visualization of the most prominent vessels and internal structures.",Ducts;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Clustering algorithms;Data visualization;Visualization;confocal microscopy data;image processing;DBSCAN clustering;volumetric visualization,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE 32nd International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),10.1109/CBMS.2019.00086
How to Automatically Identify Regions of Interest in High-Resolution Images of Lung Biopsy for Interstitial Fibrosis Diagnosis,"Airway-centered Interstitial Fibrosis (ACIF) is a histological pattern of Interstitial lung diseases. Its diagnosis requires a multidisciplinary approach, in which diverse information, such as clinical data, computed tomography data, and lung biopsy data, is analyzed. Biopsy samples are digitized at high-resolution. Of crucial interest are broncho-and bronchiolocentric remodeling with extracellular matrix deposition. To analyze an image, specialists have to explore it at low microscope magnification, select a region of interest and export a smaller specified sub-image to be interpreted at higher magnification. This process is performed several times, requiring hours, becoming a tiresome task. We propose a method to support pathologists to identify specific patterns of ACIF in high-resolution images from lung biopsies. This can be done by a) automatic microscope magnification reduction; b) computing the probability of pixels belonging to high-density regions; c) extracting Local Binary Patterns (LBP) of the high-and low-density regions; and d) visualizing them in color. We have evaluated our method on nine high-resolution lung biopsies. We have tested the LBP features of high-and low-density regions with the kNN algorithm and obtained a classification accuracy of 94.4%, which is the highest one reported in the literature for this type of data.","Microscopy;Biopsy;Lung;Image color analysis;Image resolution;Feature extraction;Diseases;Airway-centered Interstitial Fibrosis, high resolution lung biopsy, image analysis, quantitative assessment of microscopic images, interstitial fibrosis diagnosis",INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE 32nd International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),10.1109/CBMS.2019.00118
A Real-time Fusion System for Multi-focus Microscopic Images Based on Mobile Platform,"With the rapid development of mobile platform performance, mobile devices are becoming more competent for complex tasks. In order to expand application scenarios of multi-focus microscopic image fusion technology, in this work, a real-time fusion system for multi-focus microscopic images based on mobile platform is proposed. The system, first of all, corrects the slight rotation, translation and zoom effect between multi-focus microscopy images for better efficiency and quality, using a speeded up robust features (SURF) -based registration algorithm. Then, an image Laplacian pyramid is constructed and contrast-enhanced fusion is performed in the corresponding frequency band, in the purpose of preserving more image detail information. A fused image is generated through inverse transformation and pyramid reconstruction. Extensive experiments of slice samples in different magnification and resolution scenarios illustrate that this proposed system results in high efficiency and excellent contrast of fused images.",Microscopy;Laplace equations;Image fusion;Transforms;Image reconstruction;Optical microscopy;Optical imaging;Microscopic;depth of field;multi-focus;image fusion;Laplacian pyramid,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE 8th Joint International Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC),10.1109/ITAIC.2019.8785591
Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning Applied to Charcoal Image Classification,"This paper proposes the evaluation of data augmentation impact in the process of microscopic charcoal image classification.

AUTOMATED GRADING OF PROSTATE CANCER USING ARCHITECTURAL AND TEXTURAL IMAGE FEATURES,"The current method of grading prostate cancer on histology uses the Gleason system, which describes five increasingly malignant stages of cancer according to qualitative analysis of tissue architecture. The Gleason grading system has been shown to suffer from inter- and intra-observer variability. In this paper we present a new method for automated and quantitative grading of prostate biopsy specimens. A total of 102 graph-based, morphological, and textural features are extracted from each tissue patch in order to quantify the arrangement of nuclei and glandular structures within digitized images of histological prostate tissue specimens. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the digitized histology slides into one of four different tissue classes: benign epithelium, benign stroma, Gleason grade 3 adenocarcinoma, and Gleason grade 4 adenocarcinoma. The SVM classifier was able to distinguish between all four types of tissue patterns, achieving an accuracy of 92.8% when distinguishing between Gleason grade 3 and stroma, 92.4% between epithelium and stroma, and 76.9% between Gleason grades 3 and 4. Both textural and graph-based features were found to be important in discriminating between different tissue classes. This work suggests that the current Gleason grading scheme can be improved by utilizing quantitative image analysis to aid pathologists in producing an accurate and reproducible diagnosis",Prostate cancer;Glands;Biopsy;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Biomedical engineering;Feature extraction;Image analysis;Protocols;Shape,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2007.357094
NOVEL CELL SEGMENTATION AND ONLINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR CELL PHASE IDENTIFICATION IN AUTOMATED TIME-LAPSE MICROSCOPY,"Automated identification of cell cycle phases captured via fluorescent microscopy technique is very important for cell cycle understanding and drug discovery. In this paper, we propose a novel cell detection method that utilizes both the intensity and shape information of cell to improve the segmentation quality. In contrast to conventional off-line learning algorithms for classification, our study necessitates the on-line adaptivity to accommodate the ever-changing experimental conditions. An online support vector classifier (OSVC) is thus proposed, which features the removal of support vectors from the old model and assigning the new training examples with different weights according to their importance.

PHASE-BASED SEGMENTATION OF CELLS FROM BRIGHTFIELD MICROSCOPY,"Segmentation of transparent cells in brightfield microscopy images could facilitate the quantitative analysis of corresponding fluorescence images. However, this presents a challenge due to irregular morphology and weak intensity variation, particularly in ultra-thin regions. A boundary detection technique is applied to a series of variable focus images whereby a level set contour is initialised on a defocused image with improved intensity contrast, and subsequently evolved towards the correct boundary using images of improving focus. Local phase coherence is used to identify features within the images, driving contour evolution particularly in near-focus images which lack intensity contrast.

MULTI-RESOLUTION IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING THE 2-POINT CORRELATION FUNCTIONS,"Recently, the 2-point correlation functions (2-pcfs) were employed in building feature vectors for histological image segmentation. The 2-pcfs serve as estimators of material distributions with respect to the component packing in a multi-phase sample. The multi-phase properties estimated by the 2-pcfs were represented in a tensor structure and a HOSVD-based classification algorithm was developed. In this paper, we employ a multi-resolution framework in the image and the 2-pcfs feature scale-space, in order to achieve significant savings in computational costs. We also propose a new formulation of the HOSVD classifier that learns the relative skew in the feature space. The classifier helps in improving the segmentation accuracy.

MULTISCALE INTENSITY ESTIMATION FOR MULTI-PHOTON MICROSCOPY,"Multi-photon laser scanning microscopy is a cutting-edge tool for high-resolution imaging of living tissue and organisms used to study biological processes such as cellular dynamics. The result of this powerful technique is a series of photons emissions resulting from fluorescence events occurring at each raster scan location. Each observed photon is detected along with auxiliary information such as its characteristic emission spectrum. The small number of photons collected, however, can limit the quality of the reconstructions. This paper proposes a novel reconstruction method which effectively uses the auxiliary information available in multi-photon microscopy to improve the overall reconstruction quality. The multiscale analysis framework underlying the proposed estimator results in reconstructions with accurate estimates of intensities without smoothed edges or boundaries.

SEGMENTATION OF MAMMOSPHERE STRUCTURES FROM VOLUMETRIC DATA,"3D cell culture assays have emerged as the basis of an improved model system for evaluating therapeutic agents, molecular probes, and exogenous stimuli. However, there is a gap in robust computational techniques for segmentation of image data that are collected through confocal or deconvolution microscopy. The main issue is the volume of data, overlapping subcellular compartments, and variation in scale and size of subcompartments of interest. A geometric technique has been developed to bound the solution of the problem by first localizing centers of mass for each cell and then partitioning clumps of cells along minimal intersecting surfaces. An approximate solution to the center of mass is realized through iterative spatial voting, which is tolerant to variation in shape morphologies and overlapping compartments and is shown to have an excellent noise immunity. These approximate estimates to centers of mass are then used to partition a clump of cells along minimal intersecting surfaces that are estimated by Radon transform. Examples on real data and performance of the system over a large population of data are evaluated. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed methodology is extensible in terms of its application to protein localization studies",Image segmentation;Surface morphology;Probes;Robustness;Deconvolution;Microscopy;Voting;Shape;Noise shaping;Proteins,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,10.1109/ISBI.2007.356904
AUTOMATED 3-D QUANTIFICATION OF BRAIN TISSUE AT THE CELLULAR SCALE FROM MULTI-PARAMETER CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY IMAGES,"Brain tissue is the most complex tissue in the mammalian anatomy.

It is also complex in terms of molecular constituents, and their relationship to the structural constituents. There is a need for technologies to map normal and injured brain tissue and compute appropriate quantitative measurements in support of a large number of investigations. We present a systematic methodology named FARSIGHT (fluorescence association rules for image-based insight), combining multi-parameter immuno-histochemical labeling, three-dimensional confocal microscopy, linear unmixing, segmentation, and associative morphometry to map and quantify diverse aspects of brain tissue. In addition to morphometric measurements of individual structures from individual imaging channels, we propose the use of distance maps, distance-weighted integrals, and distributions as an efficient basis for computing a versatile set of such associative measurements.

"Predicting Tumor Malignancies using Combined Computational Intelligence, Bioinformatics and Laboratory Molecular Biology Approaches","Predicting tumor malignancies is an important but difficult task. For many tumors, especially neural and endocrine tumors, traditional pathological and histological analyses often can not effectively distinguish benign from malignant tumors. Developing synergistic bioinformatics and computational intelligence system is effective, because deterministic cancer markers do not always exist in individual patients. We proposed a parallel paradigm of cancer and use a number of ensemble methods including boosting, bagging and consensus networking, and have designed a novel classification scheme that advantageously combines several computational intelligence algorithms such as the variants of self-organizing feature map (SOFM) algorithms and the maximum contrast tree (RMCT) algorithms. Boosting and bagging have been advantageously combined. When all of the above are integrated into one synergistic intelligent medical decision system, the prediction power for the task has been significantly boosted. The system and features are validated by diagnosing new patients and by a number of laboratory molecular biology measurements. The outcomes of the research have improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning, and may lead to diagnose microscopic diseases and better understanding of human genome mechanisms relating to malignant transformation",Neoplasms;Computational intelligence;Bioinformatics;Laboratories;Computational biology;Cancer;Boosting;Bagging;Endocrine system;Pathology;Computational Intelligence;Bioinformatics;Parallel Paradigm of Cancr;Benign;Maliganant Transformation,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,10.1109/CIBCB.2007.4221203
Symbol-Based Machine Learning Approach for Supervised Segmentation of Follicular Lymphoma Images,"Lymphoma is a broad term encompassing a variety of cancers of the lymphatic system.

Our work was focused on the identification of lymphomas by finding follicles in microscopy images provided by the Laboratory of Pathology in the University Hospital of Tenerife, Spain. Roughly we can divide our work in two stages: in the first stage we did image pre-processing and feature extraction, and in the second stage we used different rough set approaches for pixel classification.

Biomechanical Study on Elastic and Viscoelastic Properties of Osteoblasts Using Atomic Force Microscopy,"Exploration of cellular biomechanics properties has important pathophysiologic relevance since cellular response to external mechanical load play an significant role in the development of multitudinous clinical issues including cancer metastasis and diabetes. The qualification of cellular mechanical properties is of tremendous interest in biology and medicine. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is widely used as a quantitative nanoscale biometric tool for the characterization of cell morphology and mechanical properties. However, extraction of cellular mechanical properties from the measurements in the nanoscale remains quite complex due to challenges to analyze data according to proper theoretical model. In this paper, the cellular elastic and viscoelastic properties were characterized using AFM on murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells as a prototypical biomechanical system. The Young's modulus at different subcellular regions labelled at nucleus, cytoplasm and edge of osteoblasts was analyzed according to Hertz model with sphere indenter. The morphology of single cell grown on fibronectin coated plastic petri dishes display a polygonal shape in cobblestone appearance with cytoskeleton arrangement along the long axis. The lowest Young's modulus is observed at the cell nucleus, followed by the cytoplasm and the edge. The time dependent cellular mechanical behavior was also investigated for strain creep at constant external forces. The viscoelastic mechanical response at nuclear region is more notable than the perinuclear region.

Multimodal Representation Learning for Recommendation in Internet of Things,"The recommender system has recently drawn a lot of attention to the communities of information services and mobile applications. Many deep learning-based recommendation models have been proposed to learn the feature representations from items. However, in Internet of Things (IoT), items' description information are typically heterogeneous and multimodal, posing a challenge to items' representation learning of recommendation models. To address this challenge and to improve the recommendation effectiveness in IoT, a novel multimodal representation learning-based model (MRLM) has been proposed. In MRLM, two closely related modules were trained simultaneously; they are global feature representation learning and multimodal feature representation learning. The former was designed to learn to accurately represent the global features of items and users through simultaneous training on three tasks: 1) triplet metric learning; 2) softmax classification; and 3) microscopic verification. The latter was proposed to refine items' global features and to generate the final multimodal features by using items' multimodal description information. After MRLM converged, items' multimodal features and users' global features could be used to calculate users' preferences on items via cosine similarity. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, MRLM remarkably improved the recommendation effectiveness in IoT.",Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Data models;Training;Task analysis;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);multimodal representation;multitask optimization;recommender system,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2019.2940709
Classification of Japanese Fagaceae Wood Based on Microscopic Image Analysis,"This paper presents wood identification method on microscopic image of Japanese Fagaceae wood by applying Daubechies Wavelet (DW) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithms. The main idea for this identification is to extract as much as possible the characteristics of wood to improve accuracy. The color intensity of microscopic wood image can be one of the characteristics of wood. Therefore, before extracting features with DW and LBP, we add color extraction to separate the color intensity in the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels from the image. In addition, we compared several values of the LBP parameter for kernel type original, var, uniform, and ror to find the optimal value. The results of this work performed the accuracy of wood identification on microscopic image of Japanese Fagaceae wood with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is obtained 95.2% by setting P and R parameters at 8 and 2.

Correlative Multimodal Approach Based on Optical Near-Field and Topographic Imaging to Characterize the Morphology of ESKAPE Pathogen Bacteria at Nanoscale,"Microscopy techniques such as confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), multiphoton excitation microscopy (MPM) or coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy (CARS), are nowadays extensively utilized to study biological species and represent the ""backbone"" of many important imaging applications in biology and medicine. However, the resolution of these far-field techniques is limited by diffraction to half the wavelength of the excitation light which impedes an accurate understanding of important structures and processes taking place at nanoscale. Super-resolution techniques overcome this limitation via different ingenious concepts and strategies, and techniques such as fluorescence-Photoactivation Localization Microscopy (f-PALM), Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), or Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy are now capable to routinely achieve optical resolutions of ~50 nm, but they rely on fluorescence labelling which results in various limitations. Apertureless scattering near-field optical microscopy (ASNOM) can resolve in a label-free manner optical details <10 nm, and the underlying architecture of techniques in this family allows the simultaneous acquisition of atomic force microscopy (AFM) datasets, which is useful for placing nanoscale optical data into a registered topographic context. However, most of the studies that have been carried out until now with ASNOM were targeted on the characterization of basic and advanced materials, and due to the limited body of work targeting biological samples, ASNOM images acquired in such experiments are in most cases difficult to interpret. Moreover, although ASNOM and AFM images are usually displayed side by side in studies that involve these two techniques, an exact model to explain how the information extracted with these two distinct modalities are correlated is still not available at the time being. In this paper, we contribute to this field, by proposing a model for correlated multimodal imaging (CMI) that combines ASNOM data collected on multiple harmonics (amplitudes and phases) with AFM topography data, to create a composite image that allows a to better characterize the morphology of bacterial cells. A complete and detailed characterization of bacterial species plays a fundamental role in many biomedical studies, related to bacterial infection diagnosis and treatment. In particular, we consider pathogens of the ESKAPE group, that are involved in hospital- and community-associated infections, with a high capability to resist to different antibiotics.",Optical scattering;Optical imaging;Optical diffraction;Biomedical optical imaging;Stimulated emission;Optical microscopy;Integrated optics,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 21st International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON),10.1109/ICTON.2019.8840036
Hyperspectral Target Detection With Macro-Micro Feature Extracted by 3-D Residual Autoencoder,"Unsupervised autoencoders (AEs) have been demonstrated effectively to achieve robust performance in hyperspectral feature extraction. However, one-dimension inputs of AE cannot get precise detection due to spatial information loss. And the improved convolutional AEs (CAEs) perform outstandingly in microscopic spatial-spectral details learning, but lack macroscopic contextual information, which can provide meaningful sizes and shapes for target detection. To address this issue, a three-dimensional (3-D) macro-micro convolutional AE network is proposed to preserve both macro and micro information in this article. Furthermore, to make it easier to optimize, residual learning is induced for refining the network, and forming a novel 3-D macro-micro residual AE (3-D-MMRAE). For feature extraction, 3-D-MMRAE aggregates features from a macro branch and a micro branch, capturing discriminative and valuable structures. In addition, a promising loss combined with similarity measurement and distance constraint is proposed to improve the discriminative capacity and refine the reconstruction process. At last, the extracted features are fed to a novel hierarchical radial basis function (hRBF) detector for target preservation and background suppression.

A Reaction-Based Approach to Information Cascade Analysis,"Online social media provides massive open-ended platforms for users of a wide variety of backgrounds, interests, and beliefs to interact and debate, facilitating countless information cascades across many subjects. With numerous unique voices being lent to the ever-growing information stream, it is essential to consider the question: how do the many types of conversations within an information cascade characterize the process as a whole? In this paper we analyze the underlying features of the dynamics of communication, and use those features to explain the inherent properties of the encompassing information cascade. Utilizing ""microscopic"" trends to describe ""macroscopic"" phenomena, we set a paradigm for analyzing information dissemination through the individual user interactions that sprout from a source topic, instead of trying to interpret the emergent patterns themselves. This paradigm yields a set of unique tools for a myriad of application in the field of information cascade analysis: from topic classification of sources to time-series forecasting. We use these tools in a 88-million-row dataset for Reddit to show their conceptual effectiveness and accuracy when compared to the ground truth.",Feature extraction;Aggregates;Motion pictures;Twitter;Visualization;Tagging,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 28th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),10.1109/ICCCN.2019.8847096
Double Transfer Learning for Breast Cancer Histopathologic Image Classification,"This work proposes a classification approach for breast cancer histopathologic images (HI) that uses transfer learning to extract features from HI using an Inception-v3 CNN pre-trained with ImageNet dataset. We also use transfer learning on training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on a tissue labeled colorectal cancer dataset aiming to filter the patches from a breast cancer HI and remove the irrelevant ones. We show that removing irrelevant patches before training a second SVM classifier, improves the accuracy for classifying malign and benign tumors on breast cancer images. We are able to improve the classification accuracy in 3.7% using the feature extraction transfer learning and an additional 0.7% using the irrelevant patch elimination. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in three out of the four magnification factors of the breast cancer dataset.",Breast cancer;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Tumors;Training;Biopsy;histopathologic images;transfer learning;SVM;breast cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852092
A Structural Design and Interaction Algorithm of Smart Microscope Embedded on Virtual and Real Fusion Technologies,"The microscope is an important teaching tool in secondary school biology. This important equipment needs to be understood and mastered through biological experiments. However, in actual experimental teaching in China, microscope samples are difficult to produce, preserve and share, and the implementation status is not ideal. These conditions seriously affect student enthusiasm and require additional participant labor. Moreover, they hinder teachers' evaluation of experimental learning. Thus, this paper constructs a smart microscope physical interaction kit for secondary school biology experiments. First, the main components of the traditional microscope are replaced by a variety of different sensing elements, which are 3D printed. Then, a novel multichannel information integration strategy based on visual, auditory and tactile information is proposed to manage different channels of information, to understand the user's operational intent and to organize reasonable interactions (including the display of real-time adjustment effects). Then, we propose a navigational interaction paradigm based on multimodal intent understanding, aiming at reminding users of invalid behavior and providing necessary operational guidance for users, thus achieving the purpose of intelligent interaction and intelligent experimental teaching. The experimental results show that the proposed microscope kit, multichannel integration strategy and navigation interaction algorithm not only imbue microscopy experiments with the characteristics of intelligent interaction but also stimulate student enthusiasm and help the evaluation of experimental learning. We find that these capabilities are well received by users.",Education;Optical microscopy;Electron microscopy;Tools;Biology;Pathology;Intelligent microscope;user intention understanding;multichannel integration;intelligent interaction;navigation interaction,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945330
Atherosclerotic plaque mechanical characterization coupled with vector Doppler imaging in atherosclerotic carotid arteries in-vivo,"Methods used in clinical practice to diagnose and monitor atherosclerosis present limitations. Imaging the mechanical properties of the arterial wall has demonstrated the potential evaluate plaque vulnerability and assess the risk for stroke. Adaptive Pulse Wave Imaging (PWI) is a non-invasive ultrasound imaging technique, which automatically detects points of spatial mechanical inhomogeneity along the imaged artery and provides piecewise stiffness characterization. The aims of the present study are to: 1) demonstrate the initial feasibility of adaptive PWI to image the mechanical properties of an atherosclerotic plaque 2) demonstrate the feasibility to combine adaptive PWI with vector Doppler in a single imaging modality in order to simultaneously obtain information plaque mechanical properties and plaque hemodynamics. The common carotid arteries of 1 healthy subject and 2 carotid artery disease patients were scanned in vivo. One of the patients underwent carotid endarterectomy and a plaque sample was retrieved. In this patient, a higher compliance value of the stenotic segment was estimated by Adaptive PWI as compared with the adjacent arterial wall, and the healthy carotid artery. This was corroborated by histological staining of the plaque sample, which revealed the presence of a large necrotic core and a thrombus, characteristics associated with reduced stiffness. Moreover, the same sequence demonstrated the feasibility to obtain both stiffness maps and vector flow information, showing promise in atherosclerosis diagnosis and patient care.",Atherosclerosis;Doppler effect;Imaging;Carotid arteries;Image segmentation;Mechanical factors;Pulse wave velocity;arterial stiffness;arterial stiffness inhomogeneity;stiffness mapping;atherosclerosis;vector Doppler,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857609
An Improved Object Detection Method for Mitosis Detection,"Breast cancer grading is important for patient prognosis, and the mitosis count is one of the most important indicators for breast cancer grading. Traditional methods use handcraft features and deep learning based methods to detect mitosis in a classified model. These methods are time-consuming and difficult for practical clinical practice application. For this reason, this paper proposes an improved object detection method for automatic mitosis detection from histological images. First, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract mitosis features. Then, we use the region proposed network (RPN) to locate a set of class-agnostic mitosis proposals. Finally, we use the improved R-CNN subnet to screen for mitosis from these proposals. Our approach achieved the best results in the ICPR2012 mitosis detection competition test dataset.

Breast Cancer Image Classification via Multi-level Dual-network Features and Sparse Multi-Relation Regularized Learning,"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Recently, the computer-aided diagnosis and detection technique has been developed for the early diagnosis of breast cancer, but the diagnostic efficiency has still been a challenging issue. For this reason, we aim to improve the breast cancer diagnostic accuracy and reduce the workload of doctors in this paper by devising a deep learning framework based on histological image. Therefore, we develop a model of multi-level feature of dual-network combined with sparse multi-relation regularized learning method, which enhances the classification performance and robustness. Specifically, first, we preprocess the histological images using scale transformation and color enhancement methods. Second, the multi-level features are extracted from preprocessed images using InceptionV3-ML and ResNet-50 networks. Third, the feature selection method via sparse multi-relation regularization is further developed for performance boosting and overfitting reduction.

Automatic Identification of Mixed Retinal Cells in Time-Lapse Fluorescent Microscopy Images using High-Dimensional DBSCAN,"Despite providing high spatial resolution, functional imaging remains largely unsuitable for high-throughput experiments because current practices require cells to be manually identified in a time-consuming procedure. Against this backdrop, we seek to integrate such high-resolution technique in high-throughput workflow by automating the process of cell identification. As a step forward, we attempt to identify mixed retinal cells in time-lapse fluorescent microscopy images. Unfortunately, usual 2D image segmentation as well as other existing methods do not adequately distinguish between time courses of different spatial locations. Here, the task gets further complicated due to the inherent heterogeneity of cell morphology. To overcome such challenge, we propose to use a high-dimensional (HiD) version of DBSCAN (density based spatial clustering of applications with noise) algorithm, where difference in such time courses are appropriately accounted. Significantly, outcome of the proposed method matches manually identified cells with over 80% accuracy, marking more than 50% improvement compared to a reference 2D method.",Two dimensional displays;Clustering algorithms;Retina;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Neurons,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857375
Scribbles for Metric Learning in Histological Image Segmentation,"Segmentation is a fundamental process in biomedical image analysis that enables various types of analysis. Segmenting organs in histological microscopy images is problematic because the boundaries between regions are ambiguous, the images have various appearances, and the amount of training data is limited. To address these difficulties, supervised learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural networking (CNN)) are insufficient to predict regions accurately because they usually require a large amount of training data to learn the various appearances. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic segmentation method that effectively uses scribble annotations for metric learning. Deep discriminative metric learning re-trains the representation of the feature space so that the distances between the samples with the same class labels are reduced, while those between ones with different class labels are enlarged. It makes pixel classification easy. Evaluation of the proposed method in a heart region segmentation task demonstrated that it performed better than three other methods.",Image segmentation;Measurement;Three-dimensional displays;Heart;Heating systems;Training data;Training,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856465
Creating Visual Vocabularies for The Retrieval And Classification of Histopathology Images,"State-of-the-art technologies in the fields of computer vision and machine learning led the automatic recognition of malignant structures in histopathology images. More than often, such structures are reported to be found in glands, where different morphological characteristics indicate the existence of a variety of adenocarcinomas, including prostate, breast, lung and colon cancer. Classification of images containing glandular representations in different cancer types can be performed in the whole image by the utilization of a combination of local and global features. The proposed methodology involves the exploitation of a notion utilized often in text mining called Bag of Words and employed in the service of Computer Vision with the name of Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) for the development of a retrieval and classification system for pathology images.

Predicting Human Embryos' Implantation Outcome from a Single Blastocyst Image,"Only one-third of embryo transfer cycles via invitro fertilization, the most common fertility treatment, leads to a clinical pregnancy. Identifying embryos with the highest potentials for transfer is an essential step to optimize in-vitro fertilization outcome. However, human embryos are complicated by nature and some of their developmental aspects has still remained a mystery to expert biologists. In this paper, the first-ever attempt is made to estimate probability of implantation using a single blastocyst image. First, a semantic segmentation system is proposed for human blastocyst components in microscopic images. Second, a multi-stream classification model is proposed for the prediction of embryos' implantation outcome. The proposed classification model features an architectural component, Compact-Contextualize-Calibrate (C3) to guide the feature extraction process and a slow-fusion strategy to learn cross-modality features. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method delivers the first-reported implantation outcome prediction via a single blastocyst image to date with a mean accuracy of 70.9%.",Embryo;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Convolution;Semantics;Pregnancy;Image reconstruction,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857002
Multiscale Context-Cascaded Ensemble Framework (MsC2EF): Application to Breast Histopathological Image,"Microscopic analysis of breast cell and tissue is a critical step in the definitive diagnosis of breast cancer. However, it's time-consuming and fatigable for histopathologists to find the diagnostic characteristic of cell and tissue in breast histopathological image through multiple magnification scannings. Many computer-aided studies, including traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, have been conducted to efficiently assist histopathologists in making diagnostic decision. However, precision and complexity of such approaches remain challenging. In this work, we propose and evaluate a new framework, called multiscale context-cascaded ensemble framework (MsC2EF), to classify breast histopathological images. The model based on MsC2EF exhibits a higher precision than traditional machine learning. Meantime, it is more efficient and hardware-independent compared with deep learning approaches. The MsC2EF consists of the input, cascade, and decision layers. The input layer comprises a feature extractor and a spatial pyramid of image to execute feature input from coarse to fine scales. Four ensemble channels are stacked in a parallel manner as the cascade layer to select and transfer contextual feature iteratively and adaptively. For the decision layer, kernel fusion-based method is integrated to perform classification of breast histopathological image by fusing four different feature spaces. Our proposed method has been evaluated on an open dataset. The experimental result shows that MsC2EF obtains a good classification performance (Accuracy at patch level: 0.948±0.016; accuracy at patient level: 0.981±0.016), indicating its potential application to the classification of breast histopathologist images.",Deep learning;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Breast cancer;Kernel;MsC²EF;breast cancer;histopathological image;ensemble learning,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946478
A Multidimensional Choledoch Database and Benchmarks for Cholangiocarcinoma Diagnosis,"Histopathological examination is very important for diseases diagnosis and treatment. With the development of artificial intelligence, more and more pathological databases have been reported for histopathological diagnosis because database is quite crucial for the validation and testing of feature extraction, statistical analysis and deep learning algorithms. However, most of these databases are either gray images or RGB color images of tissue sections contain limited information of samples which limited the performance of most current deep learning algorithms. There are few publicly available pathological databases that include more than two modalities for the same subject. This paper introduces a database for both microscopy hyperspectral and color images of cholangiocarcinoma, including 880 scenes from 174 individuals, among which 689 scenes are samples with part of cancer areas, 49 scenes full of cancer areas, and 142 scenes without cancer areas. In addition, all cancer areas have been precisely labeled by experienced pathologists.

An Automatic Nuclei Cells Counting Approach Using Effective Image Processing Methods,"Manual counting of nuclei cells from histological images is considered tedious process, time-consuming and subjected to human errors. Therefore, automated the process of nuclei cells counting is become important and necessary for effective analyzing of histological images. Current systems and approaches of nuclei cells counting are based on color or grayscale images leading to inaccurate results and have several limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel accurate approach for automatic nuclei cells counting using effective image processing methods. The new techniques are designed based on image thresholding method, morphological image processing operations, and connected component algorithm. The new approach was evaluated experimentally on 37 images of a public data set of 100 histological images. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach achieved a high accuracy up to 89.5% compared with previous works.

Two Schemes for Automated Diagnosis of Lentigo on Confocal Microscopy Images,"Reflectance Confocal Microscopy is an imaging modality increasingly used for diagnosis of skin pathologies in clinical context thanks to specific and rich information they provide. However, few studies apply automatic methods for prediction in this kind of images. In this paper, we investigate in this paper a classification on these images on three categories: Healthy, Benign and Malignant Lentigo. To this end, we implement three feature extraction methods, namely Wavelets, Haralick and CNN through Transfer Learning. Furthermore, we exploit these feature extraction within two approaches: the first one operates on the entire image and the second one operates at patch-level (multiple patches per image) by giving a score to each patch. The scores are merged later to build a final decision for an image. Results show that Transfer learning obtains the best results for the two approaches, particularly with Average pooling.",Feature extraction;Cancer;Pipelines;Pathology;Skin;Standards;Training;dermatology;classification;lentigo;Reflectance Confocal Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE 4th International Conference on Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP),10.1109/SIPROCESS.2019.8868595

Multiscale Vascular Enhancement Filter Applied to In Vivo Morphologic and Functional Photoacoustic Imaging of Rat Ocular Vasculature,"Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is used for in vivo imaging of a variety of albino and pigmented eyes taking advantages of requiring no exogenous dye, performing high-resolution imaging, and achieving morphologic and functional imaging at the same time. However, to accurately diagnose the ophthalmic disease in the OR-PAM images, vascular enhancement algorithms are necessary for extracting vessels and quantifying them correctly. Vascular enhancement algorithms developed for other imaging technologies, are not suitable to be used for OR-PAM, because of the underlying differences in the physics of the formation of images. In this study, a new vascular enhancement algorithm called photoacoustic imaging vasculature enhancement filter (PAIVEF) is proposed, which not only enhances vasculature including micro-vessels signals, suppresses noise signals effectively, but also achieves highly sensitive and accurate enhancement of the vasculature within a large depth range in and out of the system's depth of focus (DOF). Using the PAIVEF, the morphologic and functional 3D images of the whole rat's ocular anterior vasculature segment was displayed simultaneously for a depth range of ~0.6 mm, which was ~7 times of the system's DOF.

Robust Nucleus Detection With Partially Labeled Exemplars,"Quantitative analysis of cell nuclei in microscopic images is an essential yet challenging source of biological and pathological information. The major challenge is accurate detection and segmentation of densely packed nuclei in images acquired under a variety of conditions. Mask R-CNN-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art nucleus segmentation. However, the current pipeline requires fully annotated training images, which are time consuming to create and sometimes noisy. Importantly, nuclei often appear similar within the same image. This similarity could be utilized to segment nuclei with only partially labeled training examples. We propose a simple yet effective region-proposal module for the current Mask R-CNN pipeline to perform few-exemplar learning. To capture the similarities between unlabeled regions and labeled nuclei, we apply decomposed self-attention to learned features. On the self-attention map, we observe strong activation at the centers and edges of all nuclei, including unlabeled nuclei. On this basis, our region-proposal module propagates partial annotations to the whole image and proposes effective bounding boxes for the bounding box-regression and binary mask-generation modules. Our method effectively learns from unlabeled regions thereby improving detection performance. We test our method with various nuclear images. When trained with only 1/4 of the nuclei annotated, our approach retains a detection accuracy comparable to that from training with fully annotated data. Moreover, our method can serve as a bootstrapping step to create full annotations of datasets, iteratively generating and correcting annotations until a predetermined coverage and accuracy are reached.

After that we have converted the image to proper format (YCbCr) for segmentation. For segmenting, we have used the combination of Gaussian Distribution, Otsu Adaptive Thresholding and for clustering we have used K-Means method.

White Blood Cell Segmentation via Sparsity and Geometry Constraints,"Digital pathology and microscopic image analysis play an important role in cell morphology research. In particular, the effective segmentation of White Blood Cells (WBCs) remains a challenging problem due to the blurring boundaries of WBCs under rapid staining, as well as the adhesion between leukocytes and other cells. In this paper, we propose a novel WBC (including nuclei and cells) segmentation algorithm based on both sparsity and geometry constraints. Specifically, we first construct a sparse image representation via combining the HSL color space and the RGB color channels, followed by the use of a sparsity constraint to only preserve useful information from the nuclei features. In addition, we introduce a robust model fitting strategy (i.e., the geometry constraint) to detect cells. Our model fitting strategy is able to significantly improve the robustness of the proposed segmentation algorithm against outliers that could seriously contaminate WBCs. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm presents clear advantages over the state-of-the-art WBC segmentation algorithms in terms of accuracy.",Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Geometry;Feature extraction;Image representation;Computer architecture;Blood;Geometry constraint;sparsity constraint;white blood cell segmentation,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2954457
Superpixel Segmentation of Breast Cancer Pathology Images Based on Features Extracted from the Autoencoder,"In order to identify the breast cancer region, it is necessary to discriminate the pathological image of breast cancer pixel by pixel.

The most popular method that has been used by researcher is direct microscopic. However, this method still has high potential to cause some flaws related to diagnosis accuracy and fungal sensitization. Therefore, an image processing is approach to overcome the problem. In this paper, a combination of image enhancement and segmentation techniques is proposed. An image thresholding, mathematical morphological, active region based segmentation and image fusion is employed to improve the quality of particular area which gives the most important information of fungi. The image is segmented with three different conditions which are single masking for single subject, single masking for multiple subjects and double masking for multiple subjects in order to determine the effectiveness of proposed method. Experimental evaluation based on quality of image shows that the single masking for multiple subjects has better performance with 25.3235531 dB of PSNR.

A Novel Approach for Efficient Implementation of Nucleus Detection and Segmentation Using Correlated Dual Color Space,"This paper presents a novel algorithm that achieves high performance in leukocytes detection and segmentation in microscopic blood sample images. To the best of our knowledge, this algorithm is the first that exploits the correlation between two CMYK and RGB color models. Our proposed algorithm uses the upper and lower limits of the pixel intensity in the Magenta component from the CMYK color space to adjust the image contrast in the Green component of the RGB image to segment the nuclei without any pre-processing steps. The proposed algorithm was tested using a series of 30 blood sample images with different color tones, image resolutions, magnifications, and surrounding conditions. The segmented nuclei are virtually congruent to the nuclei in the original image, in term of shape and area, regardless of the type of nucleus. The overall segmentation accuracy achieved by the proposed algorithm is 98.99%, with a consistent performance for the same image resolution regardless of the number of nucleus in the blood smear image.

Automatic Live and Dead Cell Classification via Hyperspectral Imaging,"Classification of live and dead human ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3) is an important task in biomedicine research. Fluorescence is the most common technique to distinguish live and dead cells. However, it requires physical contact to the cells, which affects the appearance of the cells and their features to a certain degree. There is an urgent need to develop a novel non-invasive technology for this application. This paper proposes the first hyperspectral image (HSI) based system to address this issue. A microscopic hyperspectral imaging system is built to capture cell images. Then morphological methods are employed to extract spectral-spatial features for an SVM classifier that is capable of automatically distinguishing live and dead SKOV3 cells. We show that tensor morphology profile (TMP) leads to the best discriminative capability when compared to other features. At the same time, our work also shows that HSI works better than RGB images for this novel application thanks to its fine spectral information.",Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Cameras;Tensile stress;Morphology;Color;hyperspectral imaging;cell classification;mathematical morphology;tensor modelling,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 10th Workshop on Hyperspectral Imaging and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS),10.1109/WHISPERS.2019.8921136
Wear Particle Texture Analysis,"Wear particle analysis is used for health monitoring of a machine to identify possible failure modes resulting from various machine components. One of the initial phases of analysis typically involves a microscopic examination of particles extracted from the lubrication system. Experts in the field (Tribologists) utilize this important information from these examinations to monitor the operation of the machine and ensure efficiency, safety, and economy of the operation. This extracted information has been characterized by six morphological features of particle shape, edge curvature, size, color, thickness ratio, and surface texture. These features are the building blocks in the creation of image analysis systems to supplement the wear judgments made by experts who use traditional methods of diagnostics. The paper investigates one of the six morphological features related to the surface texture classification of wear particles.

Prostate Gleason Score Detection and Cancer Treatment Through Real-Time Formal Verification,"Currently, there are 3.1 million American men affected by prostate cancer. Early detection represents the only way to safe lives. To evaluate a prostate cancer, the most widespread rank is the so-called Gleason score, based on the microscopic cancer appearance. Once assigned to the diagnosed prostate cancer its relative Gleason score, the correct therapy to be adopted must be promptly defined. To support pathologists and radiologists in timely diagnosis, in this paper we propose a method aimed to infer the Gleason score and the prostate cancer therapy exploiting formal methods. We consider a set of radiomic features directly obtained from magnetic resonance images. For this reason the proposed method is non invasive, since it does not require a biopsy. We model magnetic resonance images of patients as timed automata networks and we assign the Gleason score and the relative treatment, exploiting a set of temporal logic properties. In the experimental analysis, the properties are verified on 36 different patients, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method with a sensitivity and a specificity equal to 1 for all the evaluated cases in Gleason score inference, and a sensitivity equal to 0.94 and a specificity equal to 1 in treatment prediction.",Radiomics;Automata;Prostate cancer;Medical treatment;Biomedical imaging;Model checking;formal methods;prostate;cancer;timed automata,ARTICLE,2019,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961754
Segmentation of Plasmodium using Saturation Channel of HSV Color Space,"Malaria is a vector-borne disease that is spread throughout all regions, especially in the tropical countries. Early malaria detection is necessary to reduce the mortality rate. Microscopic imaging technique is still considered as gold standard for diagnosing malaria. However, due to numerous number of patients with limited parasitological experts, it is necessary to have such an automated system for diagnosing malaria. To obtain more accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have an accurate segmentation of Plasmodium. This study aims to develop a scheme to segment Plasmodium in digital thin blood smear images with different characteristics. There are three main steps consisting of preprocessing, grouping of image characteristics and segmenting Plasmodium. Saturation channel is extracted from HSV in the preprocessing. Difference of image standard deviation is keys for grouping the image characteristics. There are three groups of image that is segmented in different ways. Otsu thresholding combined with morphological image processing is used to segment Plasmodium. The data used contains 124 cropped images. The evaluation results achieve 97.99%, 82.23% and 99.33% of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively. These high evaluation values indicate that the proposed method is suitable to support the development of CAD in malaria diagnosing.",Diseases;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Standards;Blood;Image color analysis;Histograms;HSV;Plasmodium;Malaria;Segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT),10.1109/ICOIACT46704.2019.8938471

Invited Speech 1: A New Model To Classify The Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of cancer which attacks blood cells and spinal cord. A patient needs to conduct early detection to avoid more severe conditions. In this research, we proposed a new model to detect acute lymphoblastic leukemia by microscopic images. We divide fives stages to classify acute lymphoblastic leukemia, i.e. An image enhancement, an image segmentation, noise removal, feature extraction, and classification. Firstly, we enhanced the green channel before the segmentation process. Secondly, we employed the entropy method to obtain the best threshold value. However, the segmentation results have delivered small regions besides the main object. Thirdly, we have to remove the small objects before feature extraction. In addition, We extract the main object using energy, entropy, shanon entropy, and the object circularity. Lastly, we modified a learning vector quantization. The proposed algorithm synchronized the weight value, which has the maximum probability. We have evaluated our proposed algorithm using the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2). Our proposed method has delivered 96.15% maximum accuracy.

Robust Histopathology Image Analysis: To Label or to Synthesize?,"Detection, segmentation and classification of nuclei are fundamental analysis operations in digital pathology. Existing state-of-the-art approaches demand extensive amount of supervised training data from pathologists and may still perform poorly in images from unseen tissue types. We propose an unsupervised approach for histopathology image segmentation that synthesizes heterogeneous sets of training image patches, of every tissue type. Although our synthetic patches are not always of high quality, we harness the motley crew of generated samples through a generally applicable importance sampling method. This proposed approach, for the first time, re-weighs the training loss over synthetic data so that the ideal (unbiased) generalization loss over the true data distribution is minimized. This enables us to use a random polygon generator to synthesize approximate cellular structures (i.e., nuclear masks) for which no real examples are given in many tissue types, and hence, GAN-based methods are not suited. In addition, we propose a hybrid synthesis pipeline that utilizes textures in real histopathology patches and GAN models, to tackle heterogeneity in tissue textures. Compared with existing state-of-the-art supervised models, our approach generalizes significantly better on cancer types without training data. Even in cancer types with training data, our approach achieves the same performance without supervision cost. We release code and segmentation results on over 5000 Whole Slide Images (WSI) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository, a dataset that would be orders of magnitude larger than what is available today.",Training;Image segmentation;Monte Carlo methods;Histopathology;Pipelines;Training data;Minimization;Medical;Biological and Cell Microscopy;Segmentation;Grouping and Shape; Vision Applications and Systems,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),10.1109/CVPR.2019.00873

Optimal Fuzzy Clustering by Improved Biogeography-based Optimization for Leukocytes Segmentation,Automated leukocytes segmentation is a difficult process in case of histopathological images due to the presence of various morphological structures in the images. This paper proposes a new fuzzy clustering method using improved biogeography-based optimization method which segments the leukocytes in the histopathological images of inflamed rat skins. The proposed method uses the ratio of compactness and separation as an objective function for getting the better cluster quality.

FDive: Learning Relevance Models Using Pattern-based Similarity Measures,"The detection of interesting patterns in large high-dimensional datasets is difficult because of their dimensionality and pattern complexity. Therefore, analysts require automated support for the extraction of relevant patterns. In this paper, we present FDive, a visual active learning system that helps to create visually explorable relevance models, assisted by learning a pattern-based similarity. We use a small set of user-provided labels to rank similarity measures, consisting of feature descriptor and distance function combinations, by their ability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant data. Based on the best-ranked similarity measure, the system calculates an interactive Self-Organizing Map-based relevance model, which classifies data according to the cluster affiliation. It also automatically prompts further relevance feedback to improve its accuracy. Uncertain areas, especially near the decision boundaries, are highlighted and can be refined by the user. We evaluate our approach by comparison to state-of-the-art feature selection techniques and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by a case study classifying electron microscopy images of brain cells. The results show that FDive enhances both the quality and understanding of relevance models and can thus lead to new insights for brain research.",Data models;Visualization;Adaptation models;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Analytical models;Self-organizing feature maps;Visual analytics;similarity measure selection;relevance feedback;active learning;self-organizing maps,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST),10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986940

Multi-Stage Pathological Image Classification Using Semantic Segmentation,"Histopathological image analysis is an essential process for the discovery of diseases such as cancer. However, it is challenging to train CNN on whole slide images (WSIs) of gigapixel resolution considering the available memory capacity. Most of the previous works divide high resolution WSIs into small image patches and separately input them into the model to classify it as a tumor or a normal tissue. However, patch-based classification uses only patch-scale local information but ignores the relationship between neighboring patches. If we consider the relationship of neighboring patches and global features, we can improve the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a new model structure combining the patch-based classification model and whole slide-scale segmentation model in order to improve the prediction performance of automatic pathological diagnosis. We extract patch features from the classification model and input them into the segmentation model to obtain a whole slide tumor probability heatmap. The classification model considers patch-scale local features, and the segmentation model can take global information into account. We also propose a new optimization method that retains gradient information and trains the model partially for end-to-end learning with limited GPU memory capacity. We apply our method to the tumor/normal prediction on WSIs and the classification performance is improved compared with the conventional patch-based method.",Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Pathology;Memory management;Predictive models;Semantics;Image analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV),10.1109/ICCV.2019.01080
Pollen Grain Classification using Geometrical and Textural Features,"This study presents an image analysis framework coupled with machine learning algorithms for the classification of microscopy pollen grain images. Pollen grain classification has received notable attention concerning a wide range of applications such as paleontology and honey certification, forecasting of allergies caused of airborne pollen and food technology. It requires an extensive qualitative process that is mostly performed manually by an expert. Although manual classification shows satisfactory performance, it may suffer from intra and inter-observer variability and it is time consuming. This study benefits from the advances of image processing and machine learning and proposes a fully-automated analysis pipeline aiming to: A) calculate morphological characteristics from the images using a cost-effective microscope, and b) classify images into 6 pollen classes. A private dataset from the Department of Agriculture of the Hellenic Mediterranean University in Crete containing 564 images was used in this study. A Random Forest (RF) classifier was utilized to classify images. A repeated nested cross-validation (nested-CV) schema was used to estimate the generalization performance and prevent overfitting.

Raman Spectroscopy for Biomedical Applications: From Label-free Cancer Cell Sorting to Imaging,"This work presents the use of a Raman-based device and its integration/correlation with ultrasensitive microscopies (surface-enhanced Raman microscopy and confocal microscopy) for the molecular imaging and classification of normal lymphocytic B-cell and different leukemia cells from peripheral blood samples. The label-free Raman approach allowed for categorization of leukocytes into their respective lineage based on the biochemical information provided by Raman spectra. Furthermore, the single-point Raman analysis permitted the accurate discrimination of normal B-cells and leukemia-transformed cell lines (RS4;11, REH, MN60 cells), and more significantly, between leukemia cells in different differentiation/maturation stages. Raman imaging successfully and without cell destruction provided non-destructively information on the cell morphology, similarly to the standard May Grünwald-Giemsa histochemical staining protocol, but without the requirements for sample preparation. Finally, the specific analysis of the leukemic cell membrane by surface enhanced Raman scattering is shown.

Red Blood Cell and Sickle Cell Detection from Microscopic Blood Images of Sickle Cell Anemic Patient,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a type of haemolytic anemia which is the most commonly inherited blood disorder. Detection of red blood cell and sickle cell from sickle cell anemic person is a very challenging task. Besides traditional visual inspection of microscopic images, various methods have been developed which are based on image processing technique for faster and more accurate diagnosis of SCA. In this paper normal and abnormal red blood cells have been detected using Niblack's thresholding technique from microscopic blood images of sickle cell anemic patient. The process involves preprocessing of microscopic blood smear and segmenting the preprocessed image using Niblack's thresholding algorithm.

Comparative Study on Different Local Adaptive Thresholding Techniques for Detection of Sickle Cell Anaemia from Microscopic Blood Images,"Modern image processing techniques are playing an important role in the detection and diagnosis of several medical abnormalities nowadays. In the process of analysis of any image, thresholding is a significant stage. Various researchers have developed different tools for image thresholding depending on the type of applications. Adaptive thresholding is a powerful tool in processing medical images for diagnosis of various diseases. In this work several adaptive image thresholding techniques are being used in processing the blood images of patients suffering from Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The Sickle cell anaemia is a disorder of inherited type where defective haemoglobin distorts the shape of the red blood cell. It is essential to accurately identify the distorted red blood cells (RBCs) for faster diagnosis of this disease.

Nasopharyngeal Cell Spreading and Migration Characteristics on Microengineered Gratings,"Physical phenotypic behaviors of cancer cells such as spreading and migration are critical in tumor formation and expanding. On the other hand, these phenotypic behaviors are well proven to be determined by the cell environment. In this work, we adopt microengineered grating structure with ridge widths of 5 μm, 18 μm and a common depth of 15 μm to examine the corresponding migration and spreading of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Areas of cell spreading on the micro-grating substrates are quantified by an imaging technique based on interference reflection microscopy (IRM). The cell migration is characterized by recording cell positions over time, in order to derive migration speed and trajectory of every cell. Further, we investigate correlations between the spreading and migration characteristics. In short, our microengineered grating platform can be further applied in more detailed analyses on cell mechanobiology as well as the mechanotransduction-related mechanistic studies.",Gratings;Substrates;Microscopy;Reflection;Silicon;Interference;Trajectory;nasopharyngeal;cancer;spreading;migration;microstructure,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 13th International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST),10.1109/ICST46873.2019.9047681
Partially-Independent Framework for Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification,"The automated classification of histopathology images relives pathologists workload and, hence utilizing the resources to focus more on the most suspicious cases. More recently, inspired by the success of deep learning methods in computer vision application, such frameworks have also been applied in various medical image analysis applications. However, existing approaches showed less interest in exploring multi-layer features for improving the classification. We propose the integration of multi-layer features from a ResNet model for breast cancer histopathology image classification. Specifically, this work focuses on making a framework which considers both independent nature of layers as well as some partial dependency among them. Knowing that, not all the layers learn discriminative features, consideration of layers which learn to negative features will deteriorate the accuracy. Hence, we select the optimal subset of the layers based on an information-theoretic measure (ITS). Various experiments are performed on publicly available BreaKHis dataset, and demonstrate that the proposed multi-layer feature fusion yields better performance than the traditional way of using the highest layer features. This indicates that mid-and low-level features also carry useful discriminative information when explicitly considered. We also demonstrate improved performance, in most cases, over various state-of-the-art methods.",Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Computer architecture;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Biopsy,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW),10.1109/CVPRW.2019.00146
Identification of Abnormal Red Blood Cells and Diagnosing Specific Types of Anemia Using Image Processing and Support Vector Machine,"Blood is an important liquid that supports performs important functions for human. The general components of human blood are RBCs, WBCs, plasma, and platelets. Whereas, RBCs occupies the largest volume in blood. RBCs can be healthy or unhealthy. An unhealthy or abnormal red blood cells indicates blood related disorders, such as Anemia. RBCs can be determined by variations in size, shape, and color. The method in evaluating RBC is through conventional microscopy which leads to misreport results and experts are given hefty workload. A proposed system is aimed to support medical technicians, hematologist, and pathologist in identifying RBC by creating a device using Raspberry Pi that can measure the different parameter of the RBC such as area, perimeter, diameter, shape geometric factor (SGF), and detecting the central pallor and target flag. Related studies were already conducted using different approach one study uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in classifying RBC with an accuracy 90.54%.

With the proposed system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier it acquired an accuracy of 93.33% in identifying 7 different red blood cells such as normal, echinocytes, elliptocytes, dacrocytes, spherocytes, target cell, stomatocytes, and identifying unknown cells. The classification of RBC helps in diagnosing different types of anemia such as iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, and myelophthisic anemia.

Automatic Detection of Tuberculosis Bacilli in Sputum Smear Scans Based on Subgraph Classification,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic respiratory disease with high infectivity and mortality. Early diagnosis is important for curing TB and epidemic prevention. Clinically, sputum smear microscopy examination is a widely used method for TB examination. But it requires doctors to detect and count TB bacilli manually, which is laborious and error prone. Even though many semi-automatic or automatic methods have been proposed to detect TB bacilli, there are still some problems: a) Sputum smear microscopic images are shot by choosing field of view manually, b) Images have low resolution, c) Labeling TB bacilli is a huge workload. In our experiment, we adopted sputum smears images scanned by the high-resolution slide scanning system. Considering the characteristics of the images, we proposed a dataset construction strategy based on non-overlapping subgraph partition. To evaluate this method, we used three well-known convolutional neural network models (Inception v3, ResNet, DenseNet) on a dataset of 2,630 sputum smear microscopic images. The experiment results got best performances on Inception v3 with all indicators were above 98%. Then we stitched predicted results of subgraphs for display. The results reached the WHO criteria that sputum slide reading diagnosis error rate should less than 5%.

Generative and discriminative model-based approaches to microscopic image restoration and segmentation,"Image processing is one of the most important applications of recent machine learning (ML) technologies. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a popular deep learning-based ML architecture, have been developed for image processing applications. However, the application of ML to microscopic images is limited as microscopic images are often 3D/4D, that is, the image sizes can be very large, and the images may suffer from serious noise generated due to optics. In this review, three types of feature reconstruction applications to microscopic images are discussed, which fully utilize the recent advancements in ML technologies. First, multi-frame super-resolution is introduced, based on the formulation of statistical generative model-based techniques such as Bayesian inference. Second, data-driven image restoration is introduced, based on supervised discriminative model-based ML technique. In this application, CNNs are demonstrated to exhibit preferable restoration performance. Third, image segmentation based on data-driven CNNs is introduced. Image segmentation has become immensely popular in object segmentation based on electron microscopy (EM); therefore, we focus on EM image processing.",image processing;image super-resolution;Bayesian estimation;maximum likelihood estimation;deep learning;image segmentation,ARTICLE,2019,Microscopy,10.1093/jmicro/dfaa007

Robust Microscope Image Stitching Using Multiple Zooming Levels,"Microscopes usually have limited field of view so it is necessary to stitch the raw microscopy images into a virtual micorscopy image which combines the advantages of high details resolution brought by high magnification and a large field of view which gives the experience of the full image of the entire region of interests. Compared with regular panorama stitching or scanning stitching, two significant differences of microscope stitching is the amount of images need to be stitched is much larger and the features of microscopy images are quite different from landscape or texts so it is hard to make use of existing distortion correction methods. Advanced microscopes use motor platform to manipulate the subject to capture a grid structure layouts image set with their positions, and then use these data in the stitching progress to get a seamless stitched image of the region of interests. Compared with existing microscopy image stitching methods relying on motor platform, we introduce a multi-zooming-level microscope stitching method to stitch images captured through portable microscopes which does not require the position information of each images. Instead of using high zooming rate images only, we capture enough low zooming rate images of the same area and stitch them into a texture skeleton. For each high zooming rate image, we match it with all the low zooming rate image to find its rough position to use in the later stitching progress. In this way, the computational complexity is reduced significantly and the texture skeleton also helps deal with the distortion caused by accumulating errors.",Microscopy;Lenses;Cameras;Optical microscopy;Image resolution;Distortion;Computational complexity;Stitching;multilevel zooming;portable microscope,INPROCEEDINGS,2019,2019 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Visualization (ICVRV),10.1109/ICVRV47840.2019.00014
Staged Detection–Identification Framework for Cell Nuclei in Histopathology Images,"Histopathology image is an important basis for pathologists to evaluate disease at the cellular level and colon cancer tissue sections usually contain many different types of nuclei, which should be automatically detected and identified. However, the detection and the identification of cell nuclei are challenging tasks due to the complex tissue structure and the diversity of nuclear morphology. In this paper, a staged detection–identification framework is proposed for cell nuclei in colon cancer histopathology images. First, nuclei positions are detected by a position of interest network, which encodes context-aware representation on input image and decodes features on proximity map. Meanwhile, a cascade residual fusion block is presented to enhance the detection performance during the decoding process. Second, a multicropping network is developed to identify the detected cell nuclei. For reducing the impact of uncertainty, a multicropping module is designed for effectively capturing contextual feature contents around the center of a nucleus. The proposed detection–identification framework is evaluated on an available colorectal adenocarcinoma images data set, which has 100 images including more than 20 000 marked nuclei. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach demonstrates excellent performance with better prediction scores.",Feature extraction;Detectors;Cancer;Morphology;Sensitivity;Convolution;Shape;Deep convolutional neural network;histopathology image;nucleus detection;pattern recognition,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2019.2894044
Toward Accurate Quality Estimation of Screen Content Pictures With Very Sparse Reference Information,"The screen content (SC) pictures, such as webpages, serve as a visible and convenient medium to well-represent the Internet information, and therefore, the visual quality of SC pictures is highly significant and has attained a growing amount of attention. Accurate quality evaluation of SC pictures not only provides the fidelity of the conveyed information, but also contributes to the improvement of the user experience. In practical applications, a reliable estimation of SC pictures plays a considerably critical role for the optimization of the processing systems as the guidance. Based on these motivations, this paper proposes a novel method for precisely assessing the quality of SC pictures using very sparse reference information. Specifically, the proposed quality method separately extracts the macroscopic and microscopic structures, followed by comparing the differences of macroscopic and microscopic features between a pristine SC picture and its corrupted version to infer the overall quality score. By studying the feature histogram for dimensionality reduction, the proposed method merely requires two features as the reference information that can be exactly embedded in the file header with very few bits. Experiments manifest the superiority of our algorithm as compared with state-of-the-art relevant quality metrics when applied to the visual quality evaluation of SC pictures.",Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Visualization;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Distortion measurement;Estimation;Macroscopic/microscopic structure;quality estimation;screen content (SC) picture;sparse reference,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,10.1109/TIE.2019.2905831
Integrative Analysis of Pathological Images and Multi-Dimensional Genomic Data for Early-Stage Cancer Prognosis,"The integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data has received increasing attention for studying the complex mechanisms of driving cancers. However, most image-genomic studies have been restricted to combining histopathological images with the single modality of genomic data (e.g., mRNA transcription or genetic mutation), and thus neglect the fact that the molecular architecture of cancer is manifested at multiple levels, including genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional events. To address this issue, we propose a novel ordinal multi-modal feature selection (OMMFS) framework that can simultaneously identify important features from both pathological images and multi-modal genomic data (i.e., mRNA transcription, copy number variation, and DNA methylation data) for the prognosis of cancer patients. Our model is based on a generalized sparse canonical correlation analysis framework, by which we also take advantage of the ordinal survival information among different patients for survival outcome prediction. We evaluate our method on three early-stage cancer datasets derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and the experimental results demonstrated that both the selected image and multi-modal genomic markers are strongly correlated with survival enabling effective stratification of patients with distinct survival than the comparing methods, which is often difficult for early-stage cancer patients.",Feature extraction;Cancer;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Prognostics and health management;DNA;Histopathological images;multi-modal genomic data;survival analysis;early-stage cancer;ordinal multi-model feature selection,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2019.2920608
Analysis–Synthesis Learning With Shared Features: Algorithms for Histology Image Classification,"Objective: The diversity of tissue structure in histopathological images makes feature extraction for classification a challenging task. Dictionary learning within a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) framework has been shown to be successful for feature discovery. However, there exist stiff practical challenges: 1) computational complexity of SRC can be onerous in the decision stage since it involves solving a sparsity constrained optimization problem and often over a large number of image patches; and 2) images from distinct classes continue to share several geometric features. We propose a novel analysis-synthesis model learning with shared features algorithm (ALSF) for classifying such images more effectively. Methods: In the ALSF, a joint analysis and synthesis learning model is introduced to learn the classifier and the feature extractor at the same time. Unlike SRC, no explicit optimization is needed in the inference phase leading to much reduced computation. Crucially, we introduce the learning of a low-rank shared dictionary and a shared analysis operator, which more accurately represents both similarities and differences in histopathological images from distinct classes. We also develop an extension of ALSF with a sparsity constraint, whose presence or absence facilitates a cost-performance tradeoff. Results: The ALSF is evaluated on three challenging and well-known datasets: 1) spleen tissue images; 2) brain tumor images; and 3) breast cancer tissue dataset, provided by different organizations. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate both complexity and performance benefits of the ALSF over state-of-the-art alternatives. Significance: Modeling shared features with appropriate quantitative constraints lead to significantly improved classification in histopathology.",Feature extraction;Analytical models;Dictionaries;Optimization;Cancer;Deep learning;Histopathological image classification;analysis and synthesis learning model;shared features learning,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2019.2928997
Facetto: Combining Unsupervised and Supervised Learning for Hierarchical Phenotype Analysis in Multi-Channel Image Data,"Facetto is a scalable visual analytics application that is used to discover single-cell phenotypes in high-dimensional multi-channel microscopy images of human tumors and tissues. Such images represent the cutting edge of digital histology and promise to revolutionize how diseases such as cancer are studied, diagnosed, and treated. Highly multiplexed tissue images are complex, comprising 109 or more pixels, 60-plus channels, and millions of individual cells. This makes manual analysis challenging and error-prone. Existing automated approaches are also inadequate, in large part, because they are unable to effectively exploit the deep knowledge of human tissue biology available to anatomic pathologists. To overcome these challenges, Facetto enables a semi-automated analysis of cell types and states. It integrates unsupervised and supervised learning into the image and feature exploration process and offers tools for analytical provenance. Experts can cluster the data to discover new types of cancer and immune cells and use clustering results to train a convolutional neural network that classifies new cells accordingly. Likewise, the output of classifiers can be clustered to discover aggregate patterns and phenotype subsets. We also introduce a new hierarchical approach to keep track of analysis steps and data subsets created by users; this assists in the identification of cell types. Users can build phenotype trees and interact with the resulting hierarchical structures of both high-dimensional feature and image spaces. We report on use-cases in which domain scientists explore various large-scale fluorescence imaging datasets. We demonstrate how Facetto assists users in steering the clustering and classification process, inspecting analysis results, and gaining new scientific insights into cancer biology.",Cancer;Tools;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics);Biomedical imaging;Multiplexing;Clustering;Classification;Visual Analysis;Multiplex Tissue Imaging;Digital Pathology;Cancer Systems Biology,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934547
Computerized Classification of Prostate Cancer Gleason Scores from Whole Slide Images,"Histological Gleason grading of tumor patterns is one of the most powerful prognostic predictors in prostate cancer. However, manual analysis and grading performed by pathologists are typically subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we present an automatic technique for Gleason grading of prostate cancer from H&E stained whole slide pathology images using a set of novel completed and statistical local binary pattern (CSLBP) descriptors. First, the technique divides the whole slide image (WSI) into a set of small image tiles, where salient tumor tiles with high nuclei densities are selected for analysis. The CSLBP texture features that encode pixel intensity variations from circularly surrounding neighborhoods are extracted from salient image tiles to characterize different Gleason patterns. Finally, the CSLBP texture features computed from all tiles are integrated and utilized by the multi-class support vector machine (SVM) that assigns patient slides with different Gleason scores such as 6, 7, or $\geq$≥ 8. Experiments have been performed on 312 different patient cases selected from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and have achieved superior performances over state-of-the-art texture descriptors and baseline methods including deep learning models for prostate cancer Gleason grading.",Tumors;Prostate cancer;Pathology;Feature extraction;Glands;Image segmentation;Prostate cancer;medical image analysis;texture features;image classification,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2019.2941195
Reconstruction of Image Sequences From Ungated and Scanning-Aberrated Laser Scanning Microscopy Images of the Beating Heart,"Fluorescence laser-scanning microscopy is a wellestablished imaging technique in biology, available in many imaging facilities to investigate structures within live animal embryos such as zebrafish. Laser scanning microscopes (LSM) are limited when used to study dynamic heart morphology or function. Despite their ability to resolve static cardiac structures, the fast motion of the beating heart introduces severe artifacts in the scanned images and gating the acquisitions to the heartbeat is difficult to implement on traditional microscopes. Furthermore, although alternative high-speed imaging instruments exist, they are not widely available (due to cost or hardware complications), putting dynamic cardio-vascular imaging off-limits for many researchers. Here, we propose a method that allows imaging the beating heart on conventional LSMs. Our approach takes a set of images containing scanning aberrations, each triggered at an arbitrary time in the cardiac cycle, and assembles an image sequence that covers a single cardiac heartbeat. The steps are: (i) frame sorting by solving a traveling salesman problem; (ii) heartbeat duration estimation; and (iii) scan-delay compensation via space-time resampling. We characterize the performance of our method on synthetic data under several light intensities and scanning speeds. We further illustrate our method's applicability on experimental images acquired in live zebrafish larvae, and show that the reconstruction quality approaches that of fast, state-of-the-art microscopes. Our technique opens the possibility of using LSMs to carry out studies of cardiac dynamics, without the need for prospective gating or fast microscopes.",Microscopy;Image reconstruction;Heart beat;Optical microscopy;Sorting;Computational microscopy;laser scanning microscopy (LSM);confocal microscopy;fast microscopy;scanning aberration compensation;combinatorial optimization;traveling salesman problem;image and video sampling;cardiac imaging;zebrafish imaging,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging,10.1109/TCI.2019.2948772
Multi-Constrained Joint Non-Negative Matrix Factorization With Application to Imaging Genomic Study of Lung Metastasis in Soft Tissue Sarcomas,"Objective: The study of pathogenic mechanism at the genetic level by imaging genetics methods enables to effectively reveal the association of histopathology and genetics. However, there is a lack of effective and accurate tools to establish association models from macroscopic to microscopic. Methods: The multi-constrained joint non-negative matrix factorization (MCJNMF) was developed for simultaneous integration of genomic data and image data to identify common modules related to disease. Two types of data matrices were projected onto a common feature space, in which heterogeneous variables with large coefficients in the same projected direction form a common module. Meanwhile, the correlation between original data features was integrated by using regularization constraints to improve the biological relevance. Sparsity constraints and orthogonal constraints were performed on decomposition factors to minimize the redundancy between different bases and to reduce algorithm complexity. Results: This algorithm was successfully performed on the module identification of lung metastasis in soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) by integrating FDG-PET image and DNA methylation data features. Multilevel analysis on the top extracted modules revealed that these modules were closely related to the lung metastasis. Particularly, several genes with diagnostic potential for lung metastasis can be discovered from high score modules. Conclusion: This method not only can be applied for the accurate identification of patterns related to pathogenic mechanism of diseases, but also has a significant implication for discovering protein biomarkers. Significance: This method provides avenues for further studies of identifying complex association patterns of diseases according to different types of biological data.",Metastasis;Lung;Matrix decomposition;DNA;Biological tissues;Correlation;Imaging genetics;multiple constrains;non-negative matrix factorization;lung metastasis;soft tissue sarcomas,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2019.2954989
Centering of a Miniature Rotation Robot for Multi-Directional Imaging Under Microscopy,"Viewing a particular region of an object with high magnification is essentially significant in both fundamental research and practical applications, however, imaging the sample from multi-direction is still very challenging for current microscopes. Herein, a centered miniature rotation robot under microscopy is presented to achieve multi-directional imaging of small objects. First, the miniature rotatable robot is constructed by three nano motors, including one rotational and two linear-motors. Then, a new centering strategy of neighborhood-window difference is proposed to center the micro/nano sample onto the rotation axis of the robot (error less than 20 pixels). In experiments, the sample is tested to be imaged from multi-direction (360°) by rotating the robot continuously. To highlight the versatility of this system, we demonstrate the multi-directional imaging under both optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Compared with current techniques, this system is able to provide richer morphology information at small scale benefiting from the multi-directional imaging, which is expected to have long-term impacts on microscopy observation, micro defect inspection, nanomaterial characterization and other related fields.",Robots;Scanning electron microscopy;Three-dimensional displays;Optical microscopy;Atomic force microscopy;Micro/nano manipulation;Nanorobotic system;Microscopy imaging,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology,10.1109/TNANO.2019.2954896
Chip-Scale Angle-Selective Imager for In Vivo Microscopic Cancer Detection,"We present an image sensor incorporating angle-selective gratings for resolution enhancement in contact imaging applications. Optical structures designed in the CMOS metal layers above each photodiode form the angle-selective gratings that limit the sensor angle of view to ±18°, rejecting background light and deblurring the image. The imager is based on a high-gain capacitive transimpedance amplifier pixel using a custom 11fF MOM capacitor, achieving 8.2 V s-1pW-1 sensitivity. The pixel includes a leakage current minimization circuit to remove signal-dependent reset switch leakage and the corresponding dark current is 14 aA/μm2. The resulting 4.7 mm by 2.25 mm sensor (80 by 36 pixels) is designed specifically for intraoperative cancer imaging in order to solve the pervasive challenge of identifying microscopic residual cancer foci in vivo, where they can be removed. We demonstrate imaging and detection of foci containing less than 200 cancer cells labeled with fluorescent biomarkers in 50 ms with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 15 dB and the detection of microscopic residual tumor in mice models.

UNet++: Redesigning Skip Connections to Exploit Multiscale Features in Image Segmentation,"The state-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation are variants of U-Net and fully convolutional networks (FCN). Despite their success, these models have two limitations: (1) their optimal depth is apriori unknown, requiring extensive architecture search or inefficient ensemble of models of varying depths; and (2) their skip connections impose an unnecessarily restrictive fusion scheme, forcing aggregation only at the same-scale feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks. To overcome these two limitations, we propose UNet++, a new neural architecture for semantic and instance segmentation, by (1) alleviating the unknown network depth with an efficient ensemble of U-Nets of varying depths, which partially share an encoder and co-learn simultaneously using deep supervision; (2) redesigning skip connections to aggregate features of varying semantic scales at the decoder sub-networks, leading to a highly flexible feature fusion scheme; and (3) devising a pruning scheme to accelerate the inference speed of UNet++. We have evaluated UNet++ using six different medical image segmentation datasets, covering multiple imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electron microscopy (EM), and demonstrating that (1) UNet++ consistently outperforms the baseline models for the task of semantic segmentation across different datasets and backbone architectures; (2) UNet++ enhances segmentation quality of varying-size objects-an improvement over the fixed-depth U-Net; (3) Mask RCNN++ (Mask R-CNN with UNet++ design) outperforms the original Mask R-CNN for the task of instance segmentation; and (4) pruned UNet++ models achieve significant speedup while showing only modest performance degradation.

Mitochondria Segmentation From EM Images via Hierarchical Structured Contextual Forest,"Delineation of mitochondria from electron microscopy (EM) images is crucial to investigate its morphology and distribution, which are directly linked to neural dysfunction. However, it is a challenging task due to the varied appearances, sizes and shapes of mitochondria, and complicated surrounding structures. Exploiting sufficient contextual information about interactions in extended neighborhood is crucial to address the challenges. To this end, we introduce a novel class of contextual features, namely local patch pattern (LPP), to eliminate the ambiguity of local appearance and texture features. To achieve accurate segmentation, we propose an automatic method by iterative learning of hierarchical structured contextual forest. With a novel median fusion strategy, the probability predictions from long history iterations are augmented to encode spatial and temporal contexts and suppress false detections. Moreover, the LPP features are extracted on both images and history predictions, resulting in a hierarchy of contextual features with increasing receptive fields. Other than using computationally demanding graph based methods, we perform joint label prediction using structured random forest. In addition to direct 3D segmentation of EM volumes, we introduce a 2D variant without sacrificing accuracy using a novel hierarchical multi-view fusion strategy. We evaluated our proposed methods on public EPFL Hippocampus benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 90.9% in Dice. Quantitative comparison showed the effectiveness of the proposed features and strategies.",Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Random forests;Shape;History;Labeling;Segmentation;electron microscopy image;contextual features;hierarchical learning;multi-view fusion,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2961792
Breast Cancer Detection With Low-Dimensional Ordered Orthogonal Projection in Terahertz Imaging,"This article proposes a new dimension reduction algorithm based on low-dimensional ordered orthogonal projection, which is used for cancer detection with terahertz (THz) images of freshly excised human breast cancer tissues. A THz image can be represented by a data cube with each pixel containing a high-dimensional spectrum vector covering several THz frequencies, where each frequency represents a different dimension in the vector. The proposed algorithm projects the high-dimensional spectrum vector of each pixel within the THz image into a lowdimensional subspace that contains the majority of the unique features embedded in the image. The low-dimensional subspace is constructed by sequentially identifying its orthonormal basis vectors, such that each newly chosen basis vector represents the most unique information not contained by existing basis vectors. A multivariate Gaussian mixture model is used to represent the statistical distributions of the low-dimensional feature vectors obtained from the proposed dimension reduction algorithm. The model parameters are iteratively learned by using unsupervised learning methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or expectation maximization, and the results are used to classify the various regions within a tumor sample. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves apparent performance improvement in human breast cancer tissue over existing approaches such as one-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo. The results confirm that the dimension reduction algorithm presented in this article is a promising technique for breast cancer detection with THz images, and the classification results present a good correlation with respect to the histopathology results of the analyzed samples.",Breast cancer;Imaging;Feature extraction;Dimensionality reduction;Unsupervised learning;Frequency-domain analysis;Breast cancer;expectation maximization (EM);Gaussian mixture model (GMM);Gibbs sampling;low-dimensional ordered orthogonal projection (LOOP);terahertz (THz),ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology,10.1109/TTHZ.2019.2962116
Sequence Image Registration for Large Depth of Microscopic Focus Stacking,"The large depth of images for microscopic measurement can be achieved by using focus stacking techniques with a small depth of field of objective lens. It is implemented by fusing the image sequences of short depth images. However, the non-linear movement of the objective imaging system or the measured object caused by the moving stage straightness error brings the misalignment of the image sequences, such as transversal translation, rotation, and tilting. All of these interferences, as well as the image brightness variation must be corrected by image registration before fusing the image sequences. In this paper, a fast-automatic registration method based on the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) is proposed. It is achieved by firstly segmenting the focal regions of the image sequences through fast edge detection. Then the image features are extracted within the small segmented focal areas. It greatly reduces the computational cost of feature extraction and the following steps of image correction, and alignment. In the process, the random sampling consistency (RANSAC) algorithm is also used to remove the mistake features. The Laplacian pyramid method is adopted for the large depth of image fusion. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more efficient than the traditional SIFT algorithm. Its registration efficiency is improved by about 60%. This method facilitates the high-precision and real-time imaging of a monocular three-dimensional focus stacking.",Stacking;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Image registration;Three-dimensional displays;Image sequences;Focus stacking;microscopic measurement;sequence image registration;focus segmentation;scale invariant feature transform,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963633
Breast Cancer Image Classification via Multi-Network Features and Dual-Network Orthogonal Low-Rank Learning,"Histopathological image analysis is an important technique for early diagnosis and detection of breast cancer in clinical practice. However, it has limited efficiency and thus the detection of breast cancer is still an open issue in medical image analysis. To improve the early diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer and reduce the workload of doctors, we devise a classification framework based on histology images by combining deep learning with machine learning methodologies in this paper. Specifically, we devise a multi-network feature extraction model by using pre-trained deep convolution neural networks (DCNNs), develop an effective feature dimension reduction method and train an ensemble support vector machine (E-SVM). First, we preprocess the histological images via scale transformation and color enhancement methods. Second, the multi-network features are extracted by using four pre-trained DCNNs (e.g., DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, multi-level InceptionV3, and multi-level VGG-16). Third, a feature selection method via dual-network orthogonal low-rank learning (DOLL) is further developed for performance boosting and overfitting alleviation. Finally, an E-SVM is trained via fused features and voting strategy to perform the classification task, which classifies the images into four classes (i.e., benign, in situ carcinomas, invasive carcinomas, and normal). We evaluate the proposed method on the public ICIAR 2018 Challenge dataset of histology images of breast cancer and achieve a high classification accuracy of 97.70%. Experimental results show that our method can achieve quite promising performance and outperform state-of-the-art methods.",Breast cancer;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Image analysis;Convolution;Breast cancer image classification;deep convolutional neural network;multi-network features;low-rank learning;ensemble support vector machine,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964276
Color Space Transformation and Multi-Class Weighted Loss for Adhesive White Blood Cell Segmentation,"White blood cells (WBCs) are the cells of immune system, protecting against infective diseases and invasion of viruses and bacteria. Their aberrant number, both abnormal increase and decrease, is a sign of an ongoing pathology, a precise evaluation of their number is of the utmost importance as the first step of assessing a potential disease. In blood cell microscopic images, since red blood cells and platelets are similar in color with WBCs, and WBCs are partially adhesive, WBC segmentation for counting is often not resulting in a good performance. Therefore, in this work, a color space transformation is proposed to filter out red blood cells and platelets, which is transforming the blood cell microscopic images of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from RGB color space to HSV to detect and extract WBCs. For precisely segmenting adhesive WBCs in extraction results, we set cell border to the third class, in addition to foreground and background. A weighted cross-entropy loss function based on class weight and distance transformation weight enhanced U-Net to learn cell border features. Our results showed that the method proposed in this paper for WBC segmentation using the data set ALL_IDB1 could achieve an accuracy of 97.92%.",Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Colored noise;Red blood cells;Blood platelets;Interference;Color space transformation;multi-class segmentation;white blood cell segmentation;weighted loss function,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970485
A Comparative Evaluation of Texture Features for Semantic Segmentation of Breast Histopathological Images,"Breast histopathological image analysis helps in understanding the structure and distribution of the nucleus, thereby assisting in the detection of breast cancer. But analysis of histopathological image is challenging due to various reasons such as heterogeneity of nucleus structure, overlapping nuclei, clustered nuclei, variations in illumination, presence of noise etc. Limited availability of breast histopathological image dataset with fine annotations for detection of nucleus has restricted the analysis of histopathological images at the pixel-level. This paper presents fine annotations for nucleus segmentation of breast histopathological image datasets. Various textures such as Filter Banks, Gray Level Co-occurrence matrix and Local Binary Patterns are studied along with colour features for semantic segmentation of nuclei from histopathological images.

Cross-Stained Segmentation from Renal Biopsy Images Using Multi-Level Adversarial Learning,"Segmentation from renal pathological images is a key step in automatic analyzing the renal histological characteristics. However, the performance of models varies significantly in different types of stained datasets due to the appearance variations. In this paper, we design a robust and flexible model for cross-stained segmentation. It is a novel multi-level deep adversarial network architecture that consists of three sub-networks: (i) a segmentation network; (ii) a pair of multi-level mirrored discriminators for guiding the segmentation network to extract domain-invariant features; (iii) a shape discriminator that is utilized to further identify the output of the segmentation network and the ground truth. Experimental results on glomeruli segmentation from renal biopsy images indicate that our network is able to improve segmentation performance on target type of stained images and use unlabeled data to achieve similar accuracy to labeled data. In addition, this method can be easily applied to other tasks.",Image segmentation;Biopsy;Network architecture;Signal processing;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Speech processing;Segmentation;domain adaptation;multilevel adversarial network;domain-invariant feature,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,"ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9054505
A Novel Attribute-Based Symmetric Multiple Instance Learning for Histopathological Image Analysis,"Histopathological image analysis is a challenging task due to a diverse histology feature set as well as due to the presence of large non-informative regions in whole slide images. In this paper, we propose a multiple-instance learning (MIL) method for image-level classification as well as for annotating relevant regions in the image. In MIL, a common assumption is that negative bags contain only negative instances while positive bags contain one or more positive instances. This asymmetric assumption may be inappropriate for some application scenarios where negative bags also contain representative negative instances. We introduce a novel symmetric MIL framework associating each instance in a bag with an attribute which can be either negative, positive, or irrelevant. We extend the notion of relevance by introducing control over the number of relevant instances. We develop a probabilistic graphical model that incorporates the aforementioned paradigm and a corresponding computationally efficient inference for learning the model parameters and obtaining an instance level attribute-learning classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on available histopathology datasets with promising results.",Cancer;Image analysis;Training;Task analysis;Support vector machines;Image segmentation;Computational modeling;Histopathological image analysis;multiple instance learning;symmetric setting;attribute learning;cardinality constraints;dynamic programming,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2020.2987796
Renal Cell Cancer Nuclei Segmentation from Histopathology Image Using Synthetic Data,"Renal cell cancer nuclei segmentation from histopathology image is an important step in cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, an automatic cell nuclei segmentation in medical application is a difficult task. Particularly a large amount of annotated data is required for deep learning network. In this work, synthetic but annotate renal cell nuclei data are generated based on non-synthetic data reference. Furthermore, background texture is created according to reference image. The Random shapes of nuclei polygon are created where polygon regions are filled up with foreground nuclei color. The synthetic cell nuclei patches are refined with speeded-up robust feature selection algorithm. The non-synthetic reference patches are considered to assign a score for each synthetic patch where synthetic patches with highest scores are collected. The synthetic patches with corresponding masks are utilized to train U-net segmentation network, which provides better performance than existing methods. In this approach, manual data annotation does not require, which is time-consuming and expensive. The renal cell cancer histopathology data has been collected from Cancer Image Archive, USA which is used to produce non-synthetic reference patches. The proposed framework is validated with Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) datasets. We have achieved average 0.923 cell nuclei segmentation accuracy from histopathology patches where accuracy provides better segmentation result than other existing methods.",Image segmentation;Cancer;Shape;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Learning systems;Computer architecture;nuclei segmentation;renal cell cancer;synthetic nuclei data;U-net segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 16th IEEE International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications (CSPA),10.1109/CSPA48992.2020.9068701
Mathematical Modeling of Morphometric Parameters of Thyroid Gland Structure,"A comprehensive analysis of thyroid morphological parameters in various forms of thyroid pathology by mathematical modeling methods is performed. Histological methods have been used to study the thyroid gland samples in 199 patients of both sexes aged 21 to 74 years who underwent surgical treatment. The experimental data were studied by factor and discriminant analysis methods. Investigating 60 experimental parameters by the factor analysis, 14 main factors were identified, indicating 14 likely trends in the dynamics of the thyroid gland structure due to an increase in the severity of pathological processes. The discriminant analysis showed that when examining only quantitative indicators of the thyroid gland structure, cases of erroneous variant attribution in theoretical groups are possible, however, when examining the totality of indicators, a 100% correct distribution of cases by pathology groups was observed. As a result of the factor analysis, the initial system of 60 morphological indicators of the thyroid gland with various forms of pathology was minimized to 14 new non-correlating parameters (main factors), reflecting the main patterns in morphology changes in organ pathology. As a result of the discriminant analysis of the thyroid morphological parameters with various types of pathology, the importance of semi-quantitative parameters of the thyroid structure is revealed.",Surgery;Pathology;Mathematical model;Cancer;Thyroid;Medical diagnosis;Biological tissues;Discriminant analysis;factor analysis;morphometry;thyroid gland,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 Moscow Workshop on Electronic and Networking Technologies (MWENT),10.1109/MWENT47943.2020.9067485
Histopathological Image Analysis for Breast Cancer Detection Using Cubic SVM,"taking into consideration of world cancer report given by the World Health Organization (WHO) among women, breast cancer is the disease with the highest mortality rate worldwide. In Cancer disease, total of 25.2% of patients falls under the category of breast cancer. One of the main reasons behind the failure of saving cancer patients is due to latedetection and lacks of objective diagnosis in the type and level of cancer. Early detection of cancer has been improved due to evolutions in expert system and machine learning techniques with higher detection competence, for Computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper, histopathology-based feature has been taken into consideration for breast cancer detection and classification. The experimental analysis of the proposed approach has been done on publicly available dataset BreakHis. For experimental purpose we have tested K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Random forest, and about six flavors of (SVM) Support Vector classification algorithms. The experimental result shows that proposed approach for detection and classification rate of breast cancer has been achieved maximum 92.3%accuracy with a cubic SVM classifier. The analysis of the results is verified with the help of classifier goodness parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, specificity, confusion matrix and ROC curve.",Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Support vector machines;Training;Biomedical imaging;Breast Cancer;Histopathological Image;Support Vector Machine;Feature Extraction;Classifier;ROC Curve,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN),10.1109/SPIN48934.2020.9071218
A Robust Method for Nuclei Segmentation of H&E Stained Histopathology Images,"Segmentation of histopathology images is an initial and vital step for image understanding. To increase the throughput and to maintain high accuracy, we have to go for an automatic image segmentation method. Here, a robust method for segmentation of cell nuclei in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histopathology images is proposed. The proposed segmentation step consists of an initial pre-processing step containing adaptive colour de-convolution and a succession of morphological operations, followed by multilevel thresholding and post-processing steps. Minimum region size is the one parameter which is necessary for this method and set according to the resolution of histopathology image. The proposed nuclei segmentation method does not require any assumptions or prior information about cell morphology. Hence, proposed method applies to the analysis of a wide range of tissues such as liver, kidney, breast, gastric mucosa, and bone marrow and H&E stained liver histopathology images from the Hospital. Results yield that proposed nuclei segmentation provides better results in terms of quantitatively and qualitatively on two datasets.",Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Cancer;Deconvolution;Image reconstruction;Morphological operations;Signal processing algorithms;Histopathology Image;Multilevel thresholding;Nuclei Segmentation.,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN),10.1109/SPIN48934.2020.9070874
A Survey on Automated Detection of Breast Cancer based Histopathology Images,"The increasing mortality rate in the women population is mainly due to breast cancer. Diagnosing breast cancer in its early stages will always remain crucial. Hence identifying and treating the disease at the earliest will increase the possibilities of survival. Recently, by using ultrasound images a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is being developed to help radiologists to attain higher accuracy for identification. Normally, a CAD system comprises of different phases such as pre-processing, segmentation for regions of interest, feature selection & extraction, and last phase is to do classification. This paper illustrates the various methods used to deploy an automated CAD system development for the early identification of cancer disease. In this paper, various approaches used are abridged and their pros and cons are compared. The performance evaluation of the CAD system is also depicted as well. The dataset of breast cancer histology images (BACH) is made available to participate in a grand challenge aimed at the classification of microscopy and whole slide images, whereas it is made publicly available for the challenge to promote further improvements for developing an intelligent classification system in digital pathology.

Counting and Classification of Malarial Parasite From Giemsa-Stained Thin Film Images,"Malaria is a life-threatening disease causing by an infection of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium. Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest and most common human infected parasites hosted by anopheles mosquito vector. To cure a malaria infected patient and prevent further spreading, malaria diagnosis using microscopy to visualize Giemsa-stained parasites is commonly done. The microscopy diagnosis is somewhat time consuming and requires well-trained malaria experts to interpret what they see under the microscope. To address this limitation, an automated malaria infected diagnosis is needed. This work proposed a computer-aided automated diagnosis system that can perform remote field diagnosis with high accuracy while requiring less computational demands. The proposed framework consists of two main parts that are red blood cell counting and parasite life-cycle stage classification. The counting process is performed by computer vision techniques, namely Hough transform. Different machine learning techniques, i.e., Multilayer Perceptron, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, and Weighted Similarity Extreme Learning Machine, are employed in the classification task. We also demonstrated that combining hand-crafted and deep-learned features can enhance the overall performance of the framework. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods could correctly count and classify at 97.94% and 98.12% accuracy, respectively. The overall proposal system can achieve at 96.18% accuracy. This is achieved by WELM in conjunction with deep-learned (AlexNet_FC7) and the hand-crafted (color) features.",Diseases;Blood;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Machine learning;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Combining features;Giemsa-stained thin film;malaria,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990497
Research on Medical Image Classification Based on Machine Learning,"In this paper, we propose a new method for CT pathological image analysis of brain and chest to extract image features and classify images. Because the deep neural network needs a large number of labeled samples to complete the training, and the cost of medical image labeling is very high, the training samples needed to train the deep neural network are insufficient. In this paper, a semi supervised learning based image classification method is proposed, which uses a small amount of labeled pathological image data to train the network model, and then integrates the features extracted by the network to classify the image. The results show that the classification effect of the neural network is better than convolution neural network and other traditional image classification models. To some extent, it can reduce the dependence of neural network on a large number of training samples, and effectively reduce the over fitting phenomenon of the network. Through the analysis of the overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient of different classification methods under different sample numbers, it is found that the overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient are increasing with the increasing number of training samples. Especially in the case of a small number of training samples, compared with other deep neural networks and traditional classification methods, the classification accuracy of the counter neural network is about 10% higher than that of other neural networks and traditional classification methods, and the advantages are more obvious.",Feature extraction;Biological neural networks;Training;Medical diagnostic imaging;Convolution;Generators;Generative adversarial network;deep learning;feature extraction;image classification,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993887
Fast Target Detection via Template Matching in Compressive Phase Retrieval,"Template matching (TM) is a common methodology for target detection (TD) which allows detecting a target based on cross-correlation analysis between a reference pattern and the scene. State-of-the-art TD approaches do not consider the optical phase of the target as a discriminant in the detection process, because to recover the phase involves solving a computationally demanding inverse problem known as phase retrieval (PR). However, in applications such as microscopy and optical imaging, the optical phase contains valuable information that describes the shape and depth of the object. This work proposes a method for fast TD via TM, which considers the optical phase of the object in the reference pattern as a discriminant in a setup that records coded phaseless measurements (CPM). Specifically, the proposed TD methodology is established for far-field imaging. This approach consists of two steps: (i) fast approximation of the optical field from CPM based on compressive PR, including its optical phase information; (ii) cross-correlation analysis to detect the target using its optical phase. The approximation of the optical field considering its phase is performed by low-pass-filtering the leading eigenvector of a designed matrix, overcoming traditional approaches in terms of relative error. Since no explicit TD methodology that includes the optical phase as a discriminant exists in the literature, the proposed approach is compared to a method that reconstructs the optical field and then performs the detection step. Numerical results suggest that the proposed methodology detects a target under noisy scenarios using up to 75% fewer measurements in the tested datasets. Also, the proposed TD using the filtered spectral method reduces the detection time in up to 79% in the tested datasets, compared to a methodology that requires the reconstruction of the phase.",Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Optical variables measurement;Optical diffraction;Adaptive optics;Apertures;Biomedical optical imaging;Target detection;template matching (TM);phase retrieval;optical phase,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging,10.1109/TCI.2020.2995999
Signet Ring Cells Detection in Histology Images with Similarity Learning,"The detection of signet ring cells in histology images is of great value in clinical practice. However, several reasons such as appearance variations and lack of well-labelled data make it a challenging task. Considering the intrinsic characteristics of signet ring cell images, a dedicated similarity learning network is designed in this paper to help the discovery of distinctive feature representations for ring cells. Specifically, we adapt the region proposal network and add an embedding layer to enable similarity learning for training the model. Experimental results show that similarity learning can strengthen the performance of the state-of-the-art and makes our approach competent for the task of signet ring cell detection.",Detectors;Head;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Training;Image color analysis;Network architecture;Signet Ring Cell;Object Detection;Similarity Learning;Deep Learning;Computational Pathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI45749.2020.9098547
Three Dimensional Nuclei Segmentation and Classification of Fluorescence Microscopy Images,"Segmentation and classification of cell nuclei in fluorescence 3D microscopy image volumes are fundamental steps for image analysis. However, accurate cell nuclei segmentation and detection in microscopy image volumes are hampered by poor image quality, crowding of nuclei, and large variation in nuclei size and shape. In this paper, we present an unsupervised volume to volume translation approach adapted from the Recycle-GAN using modified Hausdorff distance loss for synthetically generating nuclei with better shapes. A 3D CNN with a regularization term is used for nuclei segmentation and classification followed by nuclei boundary refinement.

SU-Net and DU-Net Fusion for Tumour Segmentation in Histopathology Images,"In this work, a fusion framework[1] is proposed for automatic cancer detection and segmentation in whole-slide histopathology images [2], [3]. The framework includes two parts of fusion, multi-scale fusion, and sub-datasets fusion. For a particular type of cancer, histopathological images often demonstrate large morphological variances, the performance of an individual trained network is usually limited. We develop a fusion model that integrates two types of U-net structures: Shallow U-net (SU-net) and Deep U-net (DU-net), trained with a variety of multiple re-scaled images and different subsets of images, and finally ensemble a unified output. Smoothing and noise elimination are conducted using convolutional Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)[4]. The proposed model is validated on Automatic Cancer Detection and Classification in Whole-slide Lung Histopathology (ACDC@LungHP) challenge in ISBI2019 and Digestive-System Pathological Detection and Segmentation Challenge 2019(DigestPath 2019) in MICCAI2019.

Segmentation-Based Method Combined with Dynamic Programming for Brain Midline Delineation,"The midline related pathological image features are crucial for evaluating the severity of brain compression caused by stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). The automated midline delineation not only improves the assessment and clinical decision making for patients with stroke symptoms or head trauma but also reduces the time of diagnosis. Nevertheless, most of the previous methods model the midline by localizing the anatomical points, which are hard to detect or even missing in severe cases. In this paper, we formulate the brain midline delineation as a segmentation task and propose a three-stage framework. The proposed framework firstly aligns an input CT image into the standard space. Then, the aligned image is processed by a midline detection network (MD-Net) integrated with the CoordConv Layer and Cascade AtrousCconv Module to obtain the probability map. Finally, we formulate the optimal midline selection as a pathfinding problem to solve the problem of the discontinuity of midline delineation. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can achieve superior performance on one in-house dataset and one public dataset.",Image segmentation;Computed tomography;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Standards;Semantics;Biomedical imaging;Brain midline delineation;Computer-aided diagnosis;Segmentation;Dynamic programming,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI45749.2020.9098314
Label-Free Identification of Early Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors via Biomedical Multiphoton Microscopy and Automatic Image Analysis,"At present, early diagnosis and treatment is the most effective way to treat early gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors. Therefore, we attempted to carry out multiphoton imaging of early neuroendocrine tumors because of its ability to label-free image tissue microstructure at the cellular level. Imaging results show that this imaging technique can quickly identify the histopathological changes in mucosa and submucosa caused by tumor invasion. Furthermore, we performed automatic image analysis on SHG images and extracted two optical diagnostic features—collagen density and average intensity, and also found obvious differences in the density as well as average intensity of collagen fibers in tumor microenvironment using a series of quantitative analysis. These findings may further facilitate the development of multiphoton microscopic imaging technique for clinical use.",Tumors;Gastrointestinal tract;Microscopy;Optical imaging;Biomedical optical imaging;Multiphoton imaging;image analysis;gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3000289
Implementation of Efficient Segmentation Method for Histopathological Images,"In biomedical research domain, it is always very crucial to examine the tissue affected by disease under a microscope and determine the severity of the disease with the process called histopathology, where the labs can produce tissue slides for viewing images digitally. These histopathological images has now become fully digitized. Digitizing these slides, allows pathologist to view them on a computer rather than viewing them on the microscope. Hence cell nuclei recognition and classification plays a crucial role in early detection of cancer. This task becomes even more challenging due to its heavy noise, and small-variant sizes of cell nuclei in histopathological images. To address this issue, an optimization based super pixel clustering algorithm was employed for automatic nuclei cell segmentation. Initially, the histopathological images dataset is acquired from suitable database. And then, normalization technique is applied to remove the noise from images. After denoising, segmentation is applied by using an optimized clustering algorithm to separate the non-nuclei and nuclei cells. The main aim of the proposed method is to implement an efficient segmentation method to overcome the issues of overlapping cells by Segmenting the histopathological images of lung/breast/liver/brain cancer, the proposed work has attained good performance to further help in the early detection of cancer by extracting the relevant features for classifying the given images as benign and malignant.",Image segmentation;Histopathology;Microscopy;Noise reduction;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Normalization;segmentation;gray wolf optimizer;particle swarm optimizer;Otsu thresholding,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT),10.1109/ICICT48043.2020.9112386

Poorly Differentiated Colorectal Gland Segmentation Approach Based on Internal and External Stress in Histology Images,"Histological assessment of glands is one of the key factors in colon cancer grading. We propose an approach for segmentation of glands in colon cancer histopathology images, which bases on the characteristics of lumens and rough gland boundary. First, we present a U-net for stain separation of H& E image to obtain the H-stain, E-stain, and background stain intensity maps. Subsequently, the epithelial nuclei was identified on the H stain intensity map, and the lumen segmentation was performed on the background intensity map. Then, we employ the axis of least inertia and chain to establish a connection between the lumen and the epithelial nuclei. In the light of connection of the lumen and the epithelial nuclei, more accurately gland segmentation is performed based on the rough gland boundary. The proposed stain separation approach is unsupervised, and the stain separation makes the information contained in the H& E image more independent and easy to identify, so as to deal with the uneven stain intensity and the inconspicuous stain difference. We compare our results on a publicly available data set. The results show that the segmentation approach combining the characteristics of lumens and rough gland boundary has improved the segmentation accuracy.",Glands;Image segmentation;Colon;Cancer;Feature extraction;Electrical engineering;Image analysis;stain separation;deep learning;colorectal gland segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 5th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS),10.1109/ICCCS49078.2020.9118488
Automated Semantic Segmentation of Red Blood Cells for Sickle Cell Disease,"Red blood cell (RBC) segmentation and classification from microscopic images is a crucial step for the diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD). In this work, we adopt a deep learning based semantic segmentation framework to solve the RBC classification task. A major challenge for robust segmentation and classification is the large variations on the size, shape and viewpoint of the cells, combining with the low image quality caused by noise and artifacts. To address these challenges, we apply deformable convolution layers to the classic U-Net structure and implement the deformable U-Net (dU-Net). U-Net architecture has been shown to offer accurate localization for image semantic segmentation. Moreover, deformable convolution enables free-form deformation of the feature learning process, thus making the network more robust to various cell morphologies and image settings. dU-Net is tested on microscopic red blood cell images from patients with sickle cell disease. Results show that dU-Net can achieve highest accuracy for both binary segmentation and multi-class semantic segmentation tasks, comparing with both unsupervised and state-of-the-art deep learning based supervised segmentation methods. Through detailed investigation of the segmentation results, we further conclude that the performance improvement is mainly caused by the deformable convolution layer, which has better ability to separate the touching cells, discriminate the background noise and predict correct cell shapes without any shape priors.",Image segmentation;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Convolution;Semantics;Shape;Biomedical imaging;Automated semantic segmentation;deformable convolution;RBC;sickle cell disease;U-Net,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2020.3000484
Unsupervised Mitochondria Segmentation in EM Images via Domain Adaptive Multi-Task Learning,"Semantic segmentation of mitochondria is essential for electron microscopy image analysis. Despite the great success achieved using supervised learning, it requires a large amount of expensive per-pixel annotations. Recent studies have proposed to exploit similar but annotated domains by domain adaptation, but the possible severe domain shift poses a challenge for the model transfer. In this study, we develop an unsupervised domain adaptation method to adapt the model trained on an labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Specifically, we achieve cross-domain segmentation by integrating geometrical cues provided by the annotated labels and the visual cues latent in images of both domains in a framework of adversarial domain adaptive multi-task learning. Rather than enforcing manually-defined shape priors, we propose to learn geometrical cues from the source domain through adversarial learning. Domain-invariant and discriminative features are learned through joint adaptation. Extensive ablations, parameter analysis and comparisons have been conducted on three benchmarks under various settings. The experiments show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods both in segmentation accuracy and visual quality.",Image segmentation;Adversarial machine learning;Electron microscopy;Image reconstruction;Training;Adversarial learning;electron microscopy;mitochondria segmentation;unsupervised domain adaptation,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing,10.1109/JSTSP.2020.3005317
Research on Imbalanced Microscopic Image Classification of Harmful Algae,"Image analysis based on biological morphological differences is an important development direction for classification and determination of planktonic algae. However, it has some shortages, such as high degree of sample imbalance and difficult to have formalized description of local physiological features. To overcome these shortages, this study decomposed recognition of harmful algae microscopic images into sample supplementation, accurate segmentation, feature extraction and classification and identification. Firstly, sample imbalance is solved by Kernel-ADASYN method to generate enough samples. Target cells are separated through integration of multi-directional projections. Refined segmentation between the spine and cingulum detail regions is further realized. Later, effective feature extraction and description of global and local features were performed one by one by matching physiological features of algae with machine recognition features. Finally, the SVM model was applied for multi-class recognition. Results demonstrated that the proposed method can reduce imbalance rate of sample size and realize multi-class recognition of microscopic images of 15 categories of algae cells.",Algae;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Image recognition;Shape;Imbalanced classification;microscopic image recognition;multi-level features extraction,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007646

An effective way of diagnosis, grading and classification of endometrium adenocarcinoma is structural analysis of the tissue sample. The effectiveness of computer assisted diagnosis, grading and classification depends on glandular structure and detection of individual nuclei cell. Hematoxylin channel from H&E stained image is extracted using color deconvolution algorithm.

Analysis of Features for Breast Cancer Recognition in Different Magnifications of Histopathological Images,"Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in women in the world. There are various imaging techniques employed in the diagnosis. The histological image analysis supported by computational systems has proved to be quite effective in diagnosing the disease. In this paper, we present an approach to quantify and classify tissue samples of the breast based on features extracted from the intensity histogram, co-occurrence matrix and the Shannon, Renyi, Tsallis and Kapoor entropies. The attribute set was employed to obtain the feature vectors which were evaluated as inputs to the random forest and sequential minimal optimization algorithms with the 10-fold cross-validation technique. In this study, we investigated the proposed approach with images obtained in four levels of magnification of the publicly available Breast Cancer Histopathological Database. In the feature selection stage, we investigated the correlation-Based feature selection, ReliefF, information gain, gain ratio, one-R and symmetrical uncertainty algorithms for evaluating the performance of the proposed approach. The proposed approach achieved significant results of AUC and accuracy for all cases analyzed. The proposed approach obtained 0.997 for AUC and 97.6% for the accuracy metric.

Virus Classification by Using a Fusion of Texture Analysis Methods,"Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is one of the most important tools for virus detection and identification. It enables researchers to study the characteristics of a virus in order to classify it into groups and families. From morphological characteristics of viruses in TEM images, this paper proposes a computer vision approach for virus classification. For this purpose, we compared ten texture descriptors methods and fused them in order to obtain a higher discriminative signature. We compared this signature to other works that addressed the same virus classification problem. The result achieved by our proposed fusion approach (87.27%) surpassed the highest accuracies of previous papers, thus proving to be very effective for discriminating virus in TEM images.

AFM Tip Localization on Large Range Sample Using Particle Filter for MEMS Inspection,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful instrument that has the ability to characterize sample topography on nanoscale resolution. AFM is widely used in different fields, such as nanotechnology, semiconductor, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), bioscience. In the case of obtaining 3D topography of a large range sample, we need to know the relative position of the AFM probe to the sample. The scanning range of an AFM generally is much smaller than the sample size. Therefore, it is hard to localize the AFM tip position without other auxiliary microscopes such as optical microscope. Moreover, the AFM scanned images on a MEMS sample typically involve only simple geometries with sparse features which usually leads to the difficulty of localization. Besides, the system uncertainties including piezoelectric scanner hysteresis, thermal drift, and coarse dual stage would affect positioning accuracy. In this paper, we propose an AFM tip localization method using particle filter referring to macro robot Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We take the AFM scanned image as the unique sensor and the sample layout as the map. The sensor model of the particle filter is based on a feature extraction algorithm. To verify the efficacy of the proposed methods, both simulations and experiments are conducted, and the proposed tip localization method is highly promising.",Particle filters;Micromechanical devices;Feature extraction;Robot sensing systems;Microscopy;Layout;Mathematical model,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 American Control Conference (ACC),10.23919/ACC45564.2020.9147562
Content-based Propagation of User Markings for Interactive Segmentation of Patterned Images,"Efficient and easy segmentation of images and volumes is of great practical importance. Segmentation problems that motivate our approach originate from microscopy imaging commonly used in materials science, medicine, and biology. We formulate image segmentation as a probabilistic pixel classification problem, and we apply segmentation as a step towards characterising image content. Our method allows the user to define structures of interest by interactively marking a subset of pixels. Thanks to the real-time feedback, the user can place new markings strategically, depending on the current outcome. The final pixel classification may be obtained from a very modest user input. An important ingredient of our method is a graph that encodes image content. This graph is built in an unsupervised manner during initialisation and is based on clustering of image features. Since we combine a limited amount of userlabelled data with the clustering information obtained from the unlabelled parts of the image, our method fits in the general framework of semi-supervised learning. We demonstrate how this can be a very efficient approach to segmentation through pixel classification.",Image segmentation;Dictionaries;Neural networks;Labeling;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Training,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW),10.1109/CVPRW50498.2020.00505
Multi-object Graph-based Segmentation with Non-overlapping Surfaces,"For 3D images, segmentation via fitting surface meshes to object boundaries provides an efficient way to handle large images and enforce geometric prior knowledge. Furthermore, fitting such meshes with graph cuts has proven to be a versatile and robust framework. However, when segmenting multiple distinct objects in one image, current methods do not allow the natural constraint that objects should not overlap. In this paper, we present an extension to graph cut based methods which can provide a globally optimal segmentation of thousands of objects while guaranteeing no overlap. Our method works by separating objects with planes whose positions are determined as part of the graph cut. To demonstrate the general applicability of our method, we apply it to several 3D microscopy data sets from both biology and materials science. Our results show both quantitative and qualitative improvements.",Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Shape;Image edge detection;Optimization,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW),10.1109/CVPRW50498.2020.00496
C-Algl Net: Pathological Images Generate Diagnostic Results,"The lack of a clear correspondence between feature of lesion areas and corresponding pathological characteristics and the scarcity of high-quality histopathological image sets pose a great challenge to the establishment of interpretable computer-aided diagnostic systems. Therefore, we propose a new deep learning-based model, named as C-ALGL model (CNN-AttendLSTM-GenerateLSTM), which is able to generate visual image results with diagnostic descriptions from input histopathological images in one pass.

Channel based Threshold Segmentation of Multi-Class Cervical Cancer using Mean and Standard Deviation on Pap Smear Images,"Cervical cancer is the second most dangerous metastatic tumor where grows in a woman's cervix. Pap smear is the simplest screening test for the detection of cancer at the starting stage. Cervical cancer has two types of Normality and abnormality cancer which contains the cell and cytoplasm in the same structure. It is difficult to identify a cancerous nucleus in the cell. In Image processing, various algorithms are used to segment the nucleus alone in microscopic images. The primary scope of this paper is focusing on Pre-processing, Segmentation and Feature Extraction with six levels of Pap images. The performance evaluation has been calculated based on the segmentation results. In the first phase, pre-processing used mean filters to remove noise and enhanced with CLAHE. In the second phase, Segmentation used threshold value by taking the sum of three channels with the proposed methodology in mean and standard deviation. In the third phase, Properties of image regions, Shapes, Textures and some statistical features are extracted after segmentation. To evaluate performance measure used SSIM for each type of cancerous segmentation that is compared with K-means and Fuzzy C-means algorithm. Thus, the proposed work of separation and addition of RGB channel based segmentation gives the best results for nucleus segmentation in Pap smear images. The accuracy level 94.60 % has been obtained by using SVM and KNN classification for 182 Pap smear images with a class of six labels. Matlab R2016a is used as a programming tool.",Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Cervical cancer;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Standards;Cervical Cancer;Pap smear;RGB Channel;Cytoplasm;Cell Nucleus,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 International Conference on Electronics and Sustainable Communication Systems (ICESC),10.1109/ICESC48915.2020.9156020
Unsupervised Instance Segmentation in Microscopy Images via Panoptic Domain Adaptation and Task Re-Weighting,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for nuclei instance segmentation is important for digital pathology, as it alleviates the burden of labor-intensive annotation and domain shift across datasets. In this work, we propose a Cycle Consistency Panoptic Domain Adaptive Mask R-CNN (CyC-PDAM) architecture for unsupervised nuclei segmentation in histopathology images, by learning from fluorescence microscopy images. More specifically, we first propose a nuclei inpainting mechanism to remove the auxiliary generated objects in the synthesized images. Secondly, a semantic branch with a domain discriminator is designed to achieve panoptic-level domain adaptation. Thirdly, in order to avoid the influence of the source-biased features, we propose a task re-weighting mechanism to dynamically add trade-off weights for the task-specific loss functions. Experimental results on three datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods significantly, and demonstrates a similar performance as fully supervised methods.",Image segmentation;Task analysis;Semantics;Microscopy;Adaptation models;Object detection;Training,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00430
Lung Cancer Analysis and Diagnosis by Coalition of Photo Metric and Quality Metric Parameters,"Lung cancer still seems to be a very common cause of death among the people all over the world. This paper proposes a method which is a coalition of two statistical methods Photo Metric and Quality Metric enacted for lung cancer analysis and diagnosis. Suggested methodology is established on the basis of identified statistical and mathematical parameters exploring the light variation and quality features of the lung image to carry out the evaluation for cancerous and non-cancerous types. The distinguishing Photo Metric parameters are Brightness, Luminance, Contrast and LC index, whereas the Quality Metric parameters are VIF, MSE, VSNR and PSNR. These eight identified parameters are applied one by one on the cancerous and noncancerous lung images using image processing technique using MATLAB to get an individual parameter statistical range through number of iterations in real time. If the test image falls in the particular calculated statistical range for cancerous lung images, then the test image is infected or else normal. But practically some of the values of the statistical range for cancerous and noncancerous lungs overlaps due to which the final decision is taken by an image classifier. The ANN is used as an image classifier to sort out this problem resulting in an efficient lung cancer diagnosis. The microscopic lung images are used to implement the proposed methodology. The performance analysis of each identified parameter is the heart of this paper. The authentication of the proposed methods is tested successfully using Standard Diagnostic Test.",Lung;Cancer;Measurement;Brightness;Standards;Indexes;Statistical analysis;Lung Cancer;Photo Metric parameters;Quality Metric parameters;ANN;Standard Diagnostic Test,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 International Conference on Emerging Smart Computing and Informatics (ESCI),10.1109/ESCI48226.2020.9167532
Point-Based Registration for Multi-stained Histology Images,"Image registration is a basic task in biological image processing. Different stained histology images contain different clinical information, which could assist pathologists to diagnose a certain disease. It is necessary to improve the accuracy of image registration. In this paper, we present a robust registration method that consists of three steps: 1) extracting match points; 2) a pre-alignment consisting of a rigid transformation and an affine transformation on the coarse level; 3) an accurate non-rigid registration optimized by the extracted points. The existing methods use the features of the image pair to initial alignment. We proposed a new metric for the non-rigid transformation which adding the part of optimizing extracting points into the original metric. We evaluate our method on the dataset from the ANHIR Registration Challenge and use MrTRE (median relative target registration error) to measure the performance on the training data. The test result illustrates that the presented method is accurate and robust.",Feature extraction;Measurement;Image registration;Robustness;Splines (mathematics);Optimization;Strain;image registration;computer-aided diagnosis;histology image,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,"2020 IEEE 5th International Conference on Image, Vision and Computing (ICIVC)",10.1109/ICIVC50857.2020.9177486
A Weak Supervision-based Framework for Automatic Lung Cancer Classification on Whole Slide Image,"Classification of normal lung tissue, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) by pathological images is significant for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Due to the large scale of pathological images and the absence of definitive morphological features between LUAD and LUSC, it is time-consuming, laborious and challenging for pathologists to analyze the microscopic histopathology slides by visual observation. In this paper, a pixel-level annotation-free framework was proposed to classify normal tissue, LUAD and LUSC slides. This framework can be divided into two stages: tumor classification and localization, and subtype classification. In the first stage, EM-CNN was utilized to distinguish tumor slides from normal tissue slides and locate the discriminative regions for subsequent analysis with only image-level labels provided. In the second stage, a multi-scale network was proposed to improve the accuracy of subtype classification. This method achieved an AUC of 0.9978 for tumor classification and an AUC of 0.9684 for subtype classification, showing its superiority in lung pathological image classification compared with other methods.",Tumors;Lung;Cancer;Pathology;Training;Computer architecture;Heating systems,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176620
A Novel Pathological Images and Genomic Data Fusion Framework for Breast Cancer Survival Prediction,"Survival analysis is a valid solution for cancer treatments and outcome evaluations. Due to the wide application of medical imaging and genome technology, computer-aided survival analysis has become a popular and promising area, from which we can get relatively satisfactory results. Although there are already some impressive technologies in this field, most of them make some recommendations using single-source medical data and have not combined multi-level and multi-source data efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel pathological images and gene expression data fusion framework to perform the survival prediction. Different from previous methods, our framework can extract correlated multi-scale deep features from whole slide images (WSIs) and dimensionality reduced gene expression data respectively for jointly survival analysis. The experiment results demonstrate that the integrated multi-level image and genome features can achieve higher prediction accuracy compared with single-source features.",Feature extraction;Tumors;Gene expression;Correlation;Cancer;Genomics;Bioinformatics,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176360
Single-axon level automatic segmentation and feature extraction from immuhistochemical images of peripheral nerves,"Quantitative descriptions of the morphology and structure of peripheral nerves is central in the development of bioelectronic devices interfacing the nerves. While histological procedures and microscopy techniques yield high-resolution detailed images of individual axons, automated methods to extract relevant information at the single-axon level are not widely available. We implemented a segmentation algorithm that allows for subsequent feature extraction in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images of peripheral nerves at the single fiber scale. These features include short and long cross-sectional diameters, area, perimeter, thickness of surrounding myelin and polar coordinates of single axons within a nerve or nerve fascicle. We evaluated the performance of our algorithm using manually annotated IHC images of 27 fascicles of the swine cervical vagus; the accuracy of single-axon detection was 82%, and of the classification of fiber myelination was 89%.",Axons;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Shape;Classification algorithms;Optical fiber testing;Myelin,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175974
Recognizing Magnification Levels in Microscopic Snapshots,"Recent advances in digital imaging has transformed computer vision and machine learning to new tools for analyzing pathology images. This trend could automate some of the tasks in the diagnostic pathology and elevate the pathologist workload. The final step of any cancer diagnosis procedure is performed by the expert pathologist. These experts use microscopes with high level of optical magnification to observe minute characteristics of the tissue acquired through biopsy and fixed on glass slides. Switching between different magnifications, and finding the magnification level at which they identify the presence or absence of malignant tissues is important. As the majority of pathologists still use light microscopy, compared to digital scanners, in many instance a mounted camera on the microscope is used to capture snapshots from significant field- of-views. Repositories of such snapshots usually do not contain the magnification information. In this paper, we extract deep features of the images available on TCGA dataset with known magnification to train a classifier for magnification recognition. We compared the results with LBP, a well-known handcrafted feature extraction method. The proposed approach achieved a mean accuracy of 96% when a multi-layer perceptron was trained as a classifier.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Cancer;Radio frequency;Neurons;Pathology;Task analysis;Microscope;pathology;magnification;deep learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175653
A novel approach to segment cortical neurons in histological images of the near-term fetal sheep brain model,"Oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) and reduced blood supply (ischemia) can occur before, during or shortly after birth and can result in death, brain damage and long-term disability. Assessing neuronal survival after hypoxia-ischemia in the near-term fetal sheep brain model is essential for the development of novel treatment strategies. As manual quantification of neurons in histological images varies between different assessors and is extremely time-consuming, automation of the process is needed and has not been currently achieved. To achieve automation, successfully segmenting the neurons from the background is very important. Due to presence of densely populated overlapping cells and with no prior information of shapes and sizes, the segmentation of neurons from the image is complex. Initially, we segmented the RGB images by using K-means clustering to primarily segment the neurons from the background based on their colour value, a distance transform for seed detection and watershed method for separating overlapping objects. However, this resulted in unsatisfactory sensitivity and performance due to over-segmentation if we use the RGB image directly. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated modified approach to segment neurons that tackles the over-segmentation issue that we encountered. Initially, we separated the red, green and blue colour channel information from the RGB image. We determined that by applying the same segmentation method first to the blue channel image, then by performing segmentation on the green channel for the neurons that remain unsegmented from the blue channel segmentation and finally by performing segmentation on red channel for neurons that were still unsegmented from the green channel segmentation, improved performance results could be achieved. The modified approach increased performance for the healthy and ischemic animal images from 89.7% to 98.08% and from 94.36% to 98.06% respectively as compared to using RGB image directly.",Image segmentation;Neurons;Image color analysis;Sensitivity;Animals;Transforms;Clustering algorithms,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176734
Automated Analysis of Brain Microvasculature: From Segmentation to Anatomical Modeling,"Two-photon microscopy (TPM) can provide a detailed microscopic information of cerebrovascular structures. Extracting anatomical vascular models from TPM angiograms remains a tedious task due to image degeneration associated with TPM acquisitions and the complexity of microvascular networks. Here, we propose a fully automated pipeline capable of providing useful anatomical models of vascular structures captured with TPM. In the proposed method, we segment blood vessels using a fully convolutional neural network and employ the resulting binary labels to create an initial geometric graph enclosed within vessels boundaries. The initial geometry is then decimated and refined to form graphed curve skeletons that can retain both the vascular shape and its topology. We validate the proposed method on 3D realistic TPM angiographies and compare our results with that obtained through manual annotations.",Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Image segmentation;Pipelines;Geometry;Microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176322
A Fast and Accurate Algorithm for Nuclei Instance Segmentation in Microscopy Images,"Nuclei instance segmentation within microscopy images is a fundamental task in the pathology work-flow, based on that the meaningful nuclear features can be extracted and multiple biological related analysis can be performed. However, this task is still challenging because of the large variability among different types of nuclei. Although deep learning(DL) based methods have achieved state-of-the-art results in nuclei instance segmentation tasks, these methods are usually focus on improving the accuracy and require support of powerful computing resources. In this paper, we joint the detection and segmentation simultaneously, and propose a fast and accurate box-based nuclei instance segmentation method. Mainly, we employ a fusion module based on the feature pyramid network(FPN) to combine the complementary information of the shallow layers with deep layers for detection the nuclear location by bounding boxes. Subsequently, we crop the feature maps according to the bounding boxes and feed the cropped patches into an U-net architecture as a guide to separate clustered nuclei. The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, not only on accuracy but also on speed.

Automatic Breast Cancer Classification from Histopathological Images,"Breast cancer (BC) is a common health problem of major significance, as it is the most widely kind of cancer among women which leads to morbidity and mortality. Pathological diagnosis is considered as the golden standard of BC detection. However, the investigation of histopathology images is a challenging task. Automatic diagnosis of BC could lower the death rate by constructing a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system capable of accurately diagnosing BC and reducing the time consumed by pathologists during examinations. This paper presents a CAD system to classify BC to benign and malignant. The proposed CAD method consists of 4 stages; image pre-processing, feature extraction and fusion, feature reduction, and classification. The CAD is based on fusion features extracted with ResNet Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) with features of wavelets packet decomposition (WPD) and histograms of oriented gradient (HOG). Next, the feature data were reduced by utilizing principle component analysis (PCA). Finally, the reduced features are used to train different individual classifiers. Results show that the highest accuracy of 97.1% is achieved. The results were compared with recent related CAD systems. The comparison showed that the proposed CAD system is capable of accurately classifying BC to benign and malignant compared to other work.

Adaptive-Optics Polarization-Sensitive Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy,"An accurate visualization of structures containing collagen is essential for early detection and correct diagnosis of possible diseases. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy is a non-invasive multiphoton technique allowing high-resolution imaging of collagen-based structures. However, this technique is limited by optical aberrations. Adaptive optics (AO) procedures are often used to compensate for optical aberrations and to improve multiphoton imaging. Moreover, since polarization modulates SHG signal, the acquired images show different features depending on the incident polarization state. In this work we demonstrate a multiphoton microscope combining AO and polarization-control for SHG imaging. Results show that polarization adds extra benefits to AO in terms of image quality enhancement. Although the performance depends on each particular sample and depth imaging location, results show up to a 3× improvement in SHG signal.",Microscopy;Frequency conversion;Optical microscopy;Adaptive optics;Cornea;Optimized production technology;Second harmonic generation;adaptive optics;polarization,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 22nd International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON),10.1109/ICTON51198.2020.9203107
Count cells by weighted random forest,"Cell counting is always playing an important role in microscopy and many methods have been published to make the counting task automatic with high accuracy. Random forest (RF) is an effective ensemble model to implement the task. However, due to the random selection of samples and features, the base learners may differ much. The base learners with low accuracy will affect the final prediction. In this paper, a weighted averaging random forest is proposed to mitigate the problem. According to the evaluations on all training images, each base learner will be assigned a weight factor. It makes the base learners with high accuracy contribute more. The proposed weighted random forest is a linear combination of base learners with different weights and performs more robustly with accuracy on the standard VGG cells dataset.",Radio frequency;Training;Vegetation;Forestry;Image segmentation;Transforms;Robustness;cell count;random forest;weighted average,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 12th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC),10.1109/IHMSC49165.2020.00011
Multiplex Cellular Communities in Multi-Gigapixel Colorectal Cancer Histology Images for Tissue Phenotyping,"In computational pathology, automated tissue phenotyping in cancer histology images is a fundamental tool for profiling tumor microenvironments. Current tissue phenotyping methods use features derived from image patches which may not carry biological significance. In this work, we propose a novel multiplex cellular community-based algorithm for tissue phenotyping integrating cell-level features within a graph-based hierarchical framework. We demonstrate that such integration offers better performance compared to prior deep learning and texture-based methods as well as to cellular community based methods using uniplex networks. To this end, we construct cell-level graphs using texture, alpha diversity and multi-resolution deep features. Using these graphs, we compute cellular connectivity features which are then employed for the construction of a patch-level multiplex network. Over this network, we compute multiplex cellular communities using a novel objective function. The proposed objective function computes a low-dimensional subspace from each cellular network and subsequently seeks a common low-dimensional subspace using the Grassmann manifold. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on three publicly available datasets for tissue phenotyping, demonstrating a significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.",Cancer;Multiplexing;Feature extraction;Tumors;Biological tissues;Pathology;Cellular community detection;tissue phenotyping;computational pathology;colon cancer,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2020.3023795
Mosaicing of Dynamic Mesentery Video with Gradient Blending,"In the aspect of medical imaging, it is crucial to obtain certain structures or even cellular features in microscopic resolution. Unfortunately, the field of view is inherently limited by the capability of capturing instruments. Thus, mosaicing of such microstructure is of utmost importance in order to restore original visual information for establishing broad structure morphology. Large panoramic images with microscopic resolution can be rewarding and practical for conducting comprehensive observation and exploration of the object of interest and surrounding biological structure. But mosaicing can be challenging if there are deformable, motion-blurred, textureless, feature-poor frames. Feature-based methods perform poorly in such cases for the lack of distinctive keypoints. Standard single block correlation matching strategies might not provide robust registration due to deformable content. In addition, the panorama suffers if there is motion blur present in a sequence. To handle these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, Deformable Normalized Cross Correlation (DNCC) image matching with RANSAC to establish robust registration. Besides, to produce seamless panorama from motion-blurred frames we present gradient blending method based on image edge information. The DNCC algorithm is applied on Frog Mesentery sequences. Our result is compared with PSS/AutoStitch [1, 2] to establish the efficiency and robustness of the proposed DNCC method.",Correlation;Robustness;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Image edge detection;Image registration;Biomedical;Mesentery;Cross Correlation;Registration;Mosaicing;Gradient blending,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP40778.2020.9191045

Nuclei Segmentation Approach for Digestive Neuroendocrine Tumors Analysis Using optimized Color Space Conversion,"Microscopic examination plays a significant role in the decision making for a reliable diagnosis of digestive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), an immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis should be conducted by pathologists in order to identify cell morphology, tissue structure, and various histological disorders. The visual and manual assessment task, performed by experts, is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to inter-observer variability. Hence, there is an urgent need for developing an automatic nuclei segmentation approach which can provide an accurate number of cancerous histological tissues and overcome the issue of overlapping cells. In the proposed study, a morphological method for microscopic image segmentation is presented, this approach is mainly based on the choice of the appropriate color space, which highlights stained cells nuclei caused by stain variability and insufficient lighting conditions. Stromal cells, that differ from tumor cells in their particular form and small size, should be removed using shape criterion.

Classification and Counting of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis from Sputum Microscopic Image using Fuzzy Logic,"The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is done by detecting and counting the number of mycobacterium tuberculosis in a sputum examination done manually using a microscope. It is considered ineffective because it requires a long time and different diagnostic results. To overcome this problem, this paper implements digital image processing. There are 5 processes used on the system. Preprocessing with the RGB to HSV method is used to clarify the color of the image. Segmentation to separate objects from background images using thresholding. Feature extraction to get the value of area, perimeter, and level of roundness of the object.

Extended ResNet and Label Feature Vector Based Chromosome Classification,"Human chromosome classification is essential to the clinical diagnosis of cytogenetical diseases such as genetic disorders and cancer. This process, however, is time-consuming and requires specialist knowledge. Considerable efforts have been made to automat the process. Recently, methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks achieved state-of-the-art results on the chromosome classification task. Many studies used karyotype images in performance evaluation, few studies have reported the results of human chromosome classification on microscopical images. This paper proposes a novel method to classify single chromosome images into one of 24 types. In the proposed method an extended ResNet was first devised to extract features of single chromosome images. A label feature vector was then extracted for each of 24 chromosome types based on a validation dataset. Hausdorff distance between feature vector of an input image and each of 24 label feature vectors were calculated, and the label feature vector that has minimum hausdorff distance to the feature vector of the input image was selected as the potential label of the input image. To finally allocate the single chromosomes from a same microscopical image into one of 24 types, a Label Redistribution strategy was used to shrink the label space and to increase the efficiency of chromosome classification. Experiments were implemented with 90,624 single chromosome images, 644 of which were randomly picked to form a testing set in advance. The classification accuracy on microscopical images using our proposed method achieved an accuracy of 94.72%.",Biological cells;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Mathematical model;Task analysis;Chromosome classification;ResNet;CNN;Hausdorff distance;microscopical images,ARTICLE,2020,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034684

Texture feature analysis for the liver cancer diseases using statistical based feature extraction technique,"Feature extraction is one of the important steps in image processing because the accuracy of the system would completely depend on this step. Human soft tissues are diagnosed by a diverse set of image scanning techniques namely Sonographer, Tomography and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All these Imaging techniques are applied depending on the nature of the disease and type of organ. Texture analysis of the liver can be used for classifying the liver into normal and diseased. The texture is a fusion of repeated patterns that have regular or irregular frequency [5]. Texture visualization feature helps in the classification of the disease. Different textural analysis techniques have been developed for extracting texture features of the liver for classification such as structure base, statistical-based, model-based, transform-based and further classification is done by using single classifier or combination of classifiers. Here, the Microscopic images of the liver are used to classify it into the normal liver and diseased liver.

Effective Performance of Bins Approach for Classification of Malaria Parasite using Machine Learning,"Malaria is a severe infectious disease transferred through the bite of an infected mosquito caused by a blood parasite of the genus Plasmodium. In the past, conventional microscopy techniques have proven to be time-consuming and had observed a lack of differentiation due to poor accuracy and a few algorithms used. In this paper, our approach primarily focuses on image processing techniques to process and enhance stained thin blood smear images for feature extraction, as well as machine learning techniques for the final classification of feature space. Our emphasis is also to address the drawbacks, as mentioned earlier, by taking input cell images and performing classification using CNN. As an alternate approach, we have also computed color features using a novel Bins Approach Algorithm, statistical features using color moments, and texture features using GLCM, which also equally played a pivotal role in feature extraction for classification. Further, these images are classified into parasitized and uninfected cells by applying machine learning classifiers such as Linear SVM, Random Forest Algorithm (RNN), and KNN over feature space.

Modeling optical properties of plant epicuticular wax,"Wax is found on the leaves almost of all plants. Its physicochemical and protective properties are widely discussed in the scientific literature. In the presented work, the influence of the structure of wax on the optical properties in wheat leaves and needles of blue spruce has been revealed for the first time. Long-period ordering was established. The structural elements are nanotubes up to several microns in length and about 150 nm in diameter. The paper presents the influence of a long-period structure on the optical properties and local characteristics of light waves, including the transmission spectrum, the density of photon states, as well as fluorescence spectra and polarization microscopy.

The Hybrid Optical and Photoacoustic Microscopy: a Novel System to Image Morphological and Photoacoustic Characteristics of Cells,"Optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) can achieve an optical-dependent high lateral resolution (<; 1 μm) and visualize photoacoustic (PA) property at single-cell level. The spatial resolvability of the PA imaging is expected to precisely characterize biological activities of cells such as their interactions with drugs and contrast agents by comparing the acquired PA characteristics with the cell's morphology. However, since the conventional OR-PAM systems only visualize objects that generate PA signals, it was difficult to acquire a PA image and an optical morphological image simultaneously. Here, we report a novel system of the hybrid optical / PA microscopy that can acquire morphological and PA characteristics of cells at the same time. The performance of the developed system was validated by measuring a USAF1951 target and bovine red blood cells.",Visualization;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical microscopy;Microscopy;Cells (biology);Optical imaging;Spatial resolution;Photoacoustic Imaging;High Spatial Resolution;Cell Imaging;Photoacoustic Microscopy;Hybrid Imaging,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),10.1109/IUS46767.2020.9251548
Morpho-Geometrical Feature Extraction of Thin Blood Smear Microphotograph for Malaria Plasmodia Species and Life Stage Determination,"Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that is prevalent in tropical areas. The diagnosis of Malaria infection is conducted manually by examining a thin blood smear, conducted by an expert microscopist. Unfortunately, the manual examination of the blood slide can be time consuming and is prone to human errors. Hence, this research aims to develop an algorithm that is based on a priori knowledge of the experts [1]. In this research, a morpho-geometrical approach of feature extraction coupled with Naive Bayes classification are proposed to measure the infected cell's size and shape from a microscopic image, to do species and life stage differentiation of P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax. This is done with the help of computational geometry, recursive bottleneck detection algorithm, and thresholding with Otsu's algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using real malaria cases and validated with manual microscopy analysis by a microscopist. The results showed a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) score of 77.14%, sensitivity score of 84.37%, and an F1 score of 80.60%, which shows that the proposed feature extraction method is reliable and faithful to the expert's a priori knowledge.",Sensitivity;Shape;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Reliability;Photomicrography;Diseases;Morpho-geometrical feature extraction;Malaria;microphotograph;life-stage;diagnosis,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS),10.1109/ICACSIS51025.2020.9263220
Automated red tide algae recognition by the color microscopic image,"Red tide occurs frequently these years and have become a great threat to marine ecology and human health. Monitoring the abundance of red tide algae is very crucial for forecasting and responding potential red tide outbreak. Now there are lots of imaging techniques can rapidly collect algae images which can be used to estimate the algae concentration by classification and counting, but few technologies are specific to red tide algae. In this study, we construct a high-solution color microscopic image dataset contain nine common species of red tide algae. Based on the dataset, we develop a computer vision- based automated red tide recognition and classification system involving image segmentation, artificial feature extraction and classification based on machine learning algorithm. Image segmentation detect the single algae’s boundaries and acquire its bounding rectangular areas as the subimage from the original images, even where several objects stick together. Feature extraction process is applied to extract specific feature vectors in terms of own artificial features including shape, color and texture features. Considering the uncertainty of the rotation of the red tide algae and the possible influence of environmental light, the features both have rotation and brightness invariance. we use three different algorithms including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to construct classifiers to classify algae images based on extracted features. We also adopt the idea of ensemble learning to achieve better performance than a single algorithm.¬ The system achieves over 95% segmentation efficiency in the and 96% classification accuracy in about 200 test images, making it comparable with a trained biologist can achieve by manual method. The study proves the potential of identifying and classifying red tide algae by color microscopic images, which may provide new ideas for monitoring red tide by imaging techniques.",Feature extraction;Tides;Algae;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Support vector machines;red tide algae classification;image segamentation;artifical feature extraction;machine learning;computer version;ensemble learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,"2020 13th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)",10.1109/CISP-BMEI51763.2020.9263574
Lymphocyte Annotator: CD3+ and CD8+ IHC Stained Patch Image Annotation Tool,"In digital pathology, preliminary step for the development of Computer Aided Diagnostics involves defining and labelling an Object of Interest. Contrary to traditional tiresome method of observation and marking of objects under microscope, digital pathology enables the use of annotation tools to capture localization information and morphology for targeted object(s). However, it is quite difficult to capture this information due to high inter and intra class variance. In this paper, we have addressed these two different problems by developing an easy to use and efficient tool ""Lymphocyte Annotator"" that allows a user to draw bounding box(es) on IHC stained images, and as a result, automatically generates multiple variants of segmentation masks for the targeted object. Lymphocyte Annotator provides multiple options for bounding box selection, with variation in bounding box size and type. The developed tool targets labelling of lymphocytes in histopathological images. This annotator generates five different types of masks by using a) Chan Vese Segmentation Model, b) Morphological Active Contours without Edges Model, c) Morphological Geodesic Active Contours Model, d) Adaptive Thresholding and e) Circular Masks, thus providing user with an opportunity to use a mixture of different types of generated masks. Capturing of lymphocytes' morphology using different models incorporates morphological variance and enables training of robust deep Convolutional Neural Network.

A Classification Method of Breast Pathological Image Based on Residual Learning,"Today, breast cancer has become a globally recognized tumor disease with high incidence and high mortality. The use of advanced convolutional neural network for the auxiliary diagnosis of breast pathological images is the general trend. Due to the complex background of the medical pathology image and more noise, a bilateral filter is used for noise reduction. Aiming at the problem of refinement, complexity and weakening of the morphological texture features of breast pathological images, the idea of using residual network residual units to simplify the learning process and enhance gradient propagation is adopted. The deep residual network is used to divide the image into benign and malignant tumors. For medical images with billions of pixels, the strategy of randomly extracting image patches is employed for data enhancement, and the model is evaluated using summation rules. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the model reaches 96%.",Pathology;Breast;Feature extraction;Filtering;Noise reduction;Training;Data models;breast pathological image;residual learning;bilateral filtering;data augmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,"2020 International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL)",10.1109/CVIDL51233.2020.00033
A Hybrid Approach for Automatic Breast Cancer Detection,"Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to propose an automatic diagnosis of breast cell histopathology (BCH) images to help pathologist in breast cancer detection and diagnosis. In this paper, a hybrid approach for an automatic detection of BCH images is proposed. In preprocessing step, color normalization and histogram stretching are used for image enhancement quality. Local adaptive thresholding, K-means, morphological operations and watershed method using fast radial symmetry transform (FRST) are combined to improve segmentation performance. For the classification, 13 morphological features, 9 intensity features and 25 texture features are extracted and relevant features are selected based on ReliefF algorithm. Finally, the tumor classification is performed using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our method was tested on 58 BCH images and we achieve a segmentation and a classification accuracies of 86.77% and 86.20% respectively.

A Quaternary Classifier for the Clinical Evaluation of Pigmented Skin Lesions,"This study reports results of a pilot study, in which pigmented skin lesions are automatically classified into four classes: benign, dysplastic nevus with mild atypia, dysplastic nevus with severe atypia, and melanoma. The pilot study enrolled subjects from dermatology clinic at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas from June 2016 to August 2017. 30 high-quality dermoscopic images were randomly selected from an image bank of 96 to obtain a statistically balanced dataset. Melanoma samples were histologically verified. A dermoscopy-based automated image analyzer with quaternary classification of pigmented skin lesions was proposed. The image analyzer automatically extracts five lesion features, most used in clinical practise, applying an active contour, and pairwise classification employing six Support Vector Machines. The pairwise accuracy of classifications are reported between 92% and 94% and used to determine the corresponding confidence intervals. Through the pairwise classification results maximum hits and acyclic tree decisions were utilized to reach the final classification of a lesion. Using leave-one-out validation, accuracy of the quaternary dermoscopy-based image analyzer were determined as 90% using the histopathologic diagnoses as the ground truth. This novel, dermoscopy-based image classifier accurately classifies pigmented skin lesions small data-sets into benign, two types of dysplastic nevi, and malignant lesions.

Real-time Traffic Incident Detection Using an Autoencoder Model,"Traffic flow data collected by loop detectors have been widely used for traffic incident detection. As traffic flow data have strong spatial-temporal correlations, this study tries to detect traffic incidents using an unsupervised learning approach. In this paper, a novel automatic incident detection (AID) method based on Autoencoder (AE) is proposed to detect the occurrence time and the location of traffic incidents in both freeway and urban networks.

For this purpose, it is proposed to use empirical mode decomposition and variational mode decomposition methods as a comparison. Initially, the conversion of digital histopathological images from RGB color space to gray level is performed. Then, empirical mode decomposition and variational mode decomposition methods are applied to these images, and the obtained features are classified by using support vector machines which is a kernel-based classifier and random forests which is an ensemble-based classifier.

Stain-Refinement and Boundary-Enhancement Weight Maps for Multi-organ Nuclei Segmentation,"Nuclear detection and segmentation in pathological images is a crucial prerequisite for finding and forecast of numerous ailments. With the advancement of deep learning, high precision automatic segmentation of multi-organ nuclei pathological images is possible. The segmentation results require not only accurate foreground prediction but also careful annotation of every individual object. There are still several remaining challenges in multi-organ nuclei segmentation. Firstly, blurred boundaries and inconsistent staining make pixel-wise segmentation difficult to generate occlusive object masks. Secondly, the background noise will be retained or even enhanced after preprocessing. Thirdly, the differences in size, shape, and intensity of different organs make it harder to separate touching nuclei. Two novel weight maps of loss function are proposed, which make full use of structural information provided by raw image and its corresponding annotations, in order to supervise the network learning more available features. The Stain Refinement Weight Map focuses on the structural difference between Hematoxylin channel and Eosin channel, which has been neglected in existing methods, to highlight potential noise pixels. The Boundary-Enhancement Weight Map leverages the new boundary annotation of each individual object that has emerged in the recent dataset to help the network better divide cell clusters. We test our method on Multi-Organ Nuclei Segmentation Dataset and show that our proposed method has high accuracy in nuclei detection and can separate touching nuclei effectively in the segmentation task.

Implementation of Blood Cell Counting Algorithm using Digital Image Processing Techniques,"Blood is a connective tissue with cellular components like RBC, WBC, and platelets. If the blood cells are below the standard range it leads to varies health diseases and hence proper blood cell counting technique plays importance in the pathology department. The most widely used method for counting blood cells is the microscopic technique which gives better results however, it takes more time to count the number of blood cells. Blood cell count using a digital image processing technique can be considered to automate the microscopic method and minimize the time taken by the conventional method. In this paper, a digital image processing technique is proposed to accurately count all the blood cells in a given slide with maximum accuracy. A method such as morphological operator, texture-based classification method and Circular Hough Transformation (CHT) used to count the RBC which gives accuracy around 90%. Similarly, Morphological Operator, Vegetation method, and Texture Object-Based classification are implemented to count the WBC and Platelet. However, Texture Object-Based classification method gave 100 % accuracy compared to Morphological Operator and Vegetation method. From the results discussed in this paper conclude that for RBC count using Circular Hough Transformation gives better result and WBC, platelets count using the Texture Object-Based classification method gives better results.",Blood;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Blood platelets;Digital images;Digital Image processing;MATLAB;Circular Hough Transformation;Morphological Operation;Edge Base Segmentation;Texture based Classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,"2020 International Conference on Recent Trends on Electronics, Information, Communication & Technology (RTEICT)",10.1109/RTEICT49044.2020.9315603
LR-Net: A Multi-task Model Using Relationship-based Contour Information to Enhance the Semantic Segmentation of Cancer Regions,"The segmentation of cancer regions is a key step in pathological image analysis. Although traditional methods (such as U-Net) have achieved good results in general medical image segmentation, the segmentation performance of the tumor region is still unsatisfactory because the boundary of the tumor is too blurred. Moreover, most tumor region segmentation methods focus on the learning of image content features while ignoring learning relationship among pixels on tumor contours. In this paper, we developed a multi-task learning technique to enhance the importance of contours and increase the weight of pixels relationship learning for the tumor segmentation. Different from the traditional single-decoder network, a parallel contour decoder with LRLM (location relationship learning module) is introduced as an auxiliary decoder to learn the relationship-based features of tumor contours, which forms a two-decoder network. To promote the information fusion of the two tasks, the two decoders share a same encoder with bidirectional skip connections between the auxiliary contour decoder and the main content decoder. Experimental results show that LR-Net is superior to many popular approaches, such as CE-Net and U-Net.",Tumors;Image segmentation;Decoding;Cancer;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Semantics;Pathological Image;Semantic Segmentation;Deep Learning;Pixel Relationship;Contour Decoder,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313420
Unlabeled Data Guided Semi-supervised Histopathology Image Segmentation,"Automatic histopathology image segmentation is crucial to disease analysis. Limited available labeled data hinders the generalizability of trained models under the fully supervised setting. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) based on generative methods has been proven to be effective in utilizing diverse image characteristics. However, it has not been well explored what kinds of generated images would be more useful for model training and how to use such images. In this paper, we propose a new data guided generative method for histopathology image segmentation by leveraging the unlabeled data distributions. First, we design an image generation module. Image content and style are disentangled and embedded in a clustering-friendly space to utilize their distributions. New images are synthesized by sampling and cross-combining contents and styles. Second, we devise an effective data selection policy for judiciously sampling the generated images: (1) to make the generated training set better cover the dataset, the clusters that are underrepresented in the original training set are covered more; (2) to make the training process more effective, we identify and oversample the images of “hard cases” in the data for which annotated training data may be scarce. Our method is evaluated on glands and nuclei datasets. We show that under both the inductive and transductive settings, our SSL method consistently boosts the performance of common segmentation models and attains state-of-the-art results.",Image segmentation;Training;Histopathology;Data models;Interpolation;Image synthesis;Image reconstruction;Image Segmentation;Semi-Supervised Learning;Image Generation,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313428
NiuEM: A Nested-iterative Unsupervised Learning Model for Single-particle Cryo-EM Image Processing,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a mainstream technology for solving spatial structures of biomacromolecules, while the processing of cryo-EM images is a very challenging task. One of the great challenges is the high noise in the images. A common method is to cluster the images with close projecting angles to get mean images, which are used for 3D reconstruction. However, due to the extremely low signal-to-noise-ratio, common clustering methods often fail to obtain high-quality mean images, leading to poorly reconstructed structures. In this study, we present a new unsupervised learning framework, called NiuEM, to discriminate images captured from different angles and yield cluster-mean images. NiuEM first generates pseudo-labels and then exploits both contrastive loss and cross-entropy loss for training convolutional layers to learn feature representations. Moreover, the pseudo-labels are updated iteratively to enhance the reliability of labels. We assess the performance of NiuEM on four data sets via both visualized and quantitative experiments. Especially, two kinds of metrics are adopted to measure the performance, regarding the clustering quality and the resolution of reconstructed 3D models, respectively. The experimental results show that NiuEM achieves very competitive clustering accuracy in the comparison with the state-of-the-art image clustering methods. Moreover, the cluster mean images yielded by NiuEM lead to better initial 3D models compared with the mainstream reconstruction tools.",Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Task analysis;Solid modeling;Electron microscopy;Convolutional neural networks;Cryo-EM;Image processing;Unsupervised learning;Clustering;CNN,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313189
Data-Efficient Histopathology Image Analysis with Deformation Representation Learning,"Histopathological examination of tissue biopsies plays a fundamental role in disease assessment. Automatic histopathology image analysis requires substantial task-specific annotations, which are often expensive and laborious in realworld scenarios. This insufficient annotation of data limits the generalization ability of supervised learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a self-supervised Deformation Representation Learning (DRL) framework to learn semantic features from unlabeled data. As a novel paradigm, our approach utilizes deformation as supervisory signals based on two critical features, i.e., local structure heterogeneity and global context homogeneity. Given an original histopathology image and its deformed counterpart, there exists a moderate difference in local structures. In contrast, due to the transformation-invariance, both images share a similar global context compared with other images. Specifically, an encoder network is trained to distinguish the local inconsistency by measuring the mutual information and maintain the global consistency with noise contrastive estimation. Extensive experiments on public histopathology image datasets show that the learned representations are generalizable for various downstream tasks, such as transfer learning on segmentation and semi-supervised classification. Our approach achieves superior results over other self-supervised methods and the ImageNet pre-trained model, and it reveals the ability as a novel pre-training scheme in histopathology image analysis.",Histopathology;Task analysis;Strain;Biomedical imaging;Image segmentation;Image analysis;Mutual information;Deformation Representation Learning;Global Context Homogeneity;Histopathology Image Analysis;Local Structure Heterogeneity;Self-Supervised Learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313159
Multidimensional and multiscale Higuchi dimension for the analysis of colorectal histological images,"Fracta1 techniques are widely explored to quantity and recognize texture patterns in digital images. Among the different types of fractal techniques, one that stands out is the Higuchi fractal dimension. The Higuchi fractal dimension allows determining how much space is filled in a two-dimensional image through the projection of the image in 1D signals. This property provides the possibility to calculate the Higuchi fractal dimension of specific regions of an image. The main drawback of this technique is that it does not allow the analysis of color images. In this work, a new Higuchi fractal dimension model is presented with the inclusion of multidimensional and multiscale strategies to expand the traditional Higuchi dimension for texture analysis in color images. The multidimensional approach was applied considering each pixel of the color image as an n-dimensional vector. The multiscale strategy was defined using different scales of observation. The proposed model was applied to a set of 151 colorectal histological images to test its ability to quantity and separate the benign and malignant groups from colorectal cancer. The performance of the proposed model was compared with that provided by consolidated fractal dimension techniques. The results obtained are promising and indicate that the proposal contributes significantly to the literature focused on the quantification and recognition of texture patterns with fractal techniques.",Fractals;Color;Cancer;Image color analysis;Pattern recognition;Proposals;Mathematical model;fractal dimension;Higuchi;multidimensional;color image;colorectal cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313575
Identifying patch-level MSI from histological images of Colorectal Cancer by a Knowledge Distillation Model,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is the result of a defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, and its presence occurs in a variety of cancers. The determination of MSI in colorectal cancer (CRC) will have a better prognosis and management of cancer patients. As the routine MSI identification via molecular testing is expensive, time-consuming, and region-restricted, novel methods to detect MSI are of great interest. In this work, we propose a multi-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework to identify MSI status in colorectal cancer patients from histopathological images. A mislabel-aware module is designed to deal with the uncertainty problem in global-local labelling. An auto-grading model is proposed to discriminate patches by the degree of their histopathological correlation with recognizable MSI status, and subsequently aggregate the weights to make slide-level predictions. Our proposed methodology outperforms the existing models in the classification accuracy, and explicitly sorts out patches with representative features. The research outcome has the potential to assist in the interpretation of histopathology as a surrogate for MSI testing and also in the study of recognizable morphology of MSI-H/MSS tumors. Furthermore, this approach can be extended and applied to other cancer types.",Training;Cancer;Tumors;Histopathology;Testing;Predictive models;Neural networks;Microsatellite instability;deep learning;convolutional neural network;distillation,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313141
Diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease by identifying Reed-Sternberg cell nuclei in histopathological images of lymph nodes stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin,"Hodgkin's disease is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. For an accurate diagnosis, a pathologist examines a slide of a sample of lymph node tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin to find a tumoral cell called Reed-Sternberg cell. The diagnosis is subjective and prone to inter/intra-observer variations. Furthermore, it is a time-consuming task. Therefore, there is a necessity to provide an automatic system for better diagnosis and detection. In this paper, a method for identifying Reed-Sternberg cell nuclei in histopathological images of lymph nodes stained with (H&E) is presented. In the preprocessing stage, noise and annoying structures are removed. Then, we identify RS cell nuclei using three different segmentation algorithms based on morphological, color, and textural features. Using the Chan-Vese Active Contour model, we find the exact boundary of the RS cell nuclei in the histopathological image and distinguish them from other objects in the image with high accuracy. The proposed scheme is tested on an actual dataset containing 98 Reed-Sternberg cell images. The experiments' results show a high correlation between the results of the proposed algorithm and the ground-truth described by the pathologists. Moreover, a comparative study with other cell nuclei segmentation methods on histopathological images demonstrates the proposed method's efficiency. It gives the highest average accuracy rate (93.80 %) compared to recent approaches.",Lymph nodes;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Diseases;Feature extraction;Biomedical engineering;Biopsy;Hodgkin Lymphoma;Nuclei Segmentation;Reed Sternberg cell;Histopathological image processing;Active Contours,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 27th National and 5th International Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME),10.1109/ICBME51989.2020.9319460
Childhood Medulloblastoma Classification Using EfficientNets,"In this work, a deep learning methodology for accurate classification of histological images of the patients suffering from childhood medulloblastoma is proposed. Pre trained EfficientNets trained on the ImageNet dataset are considered in this work. Features are extracted from the average pooling layer of EfficienNets and are given to an error correcting output code classifier. Ensemble prediction from the selected pre-trained EfficientNets is employed. For the multi class classification, the proposed approach is able to predict with a mean classification accuracy of 98.78% for 10x level images and 95.67% for the 100x level images for an 80% train and 20% test split. The peak classification accuracy is 100% for both binary and multiclass case at cell level and architectural level. For the binary classification with same split, 100% mean classification accuracy is achieved even without ensemble prediction. The results are compared with an existing work on a similar dataset and the significant improvement is demonstrated with the experimental simulations.",Deep learning;Pediatrics;IEEE Sections;Conferences;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Childhood Medulloblastoma;Classification;Efficientnets;Ensemble Learning;ECOC classifier,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE Bombay Section Signature Conference (IBSSC),10.1109/IBSSC51096.2020.9332175
Noise Robust Learning with Hard Example Aware for Pathological Image classification,"Label noise among the datasets can be memorized by deep neural networks, which degenerates the robustness of the learned model. However, recent studies proposed to deal with label noise are difficult in distinguishing informative hard examples from harmful noise ones, especially for medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a noise robust learning algorithm based on hard example aware and Co-weighting to circumvent label noise. Firstly, we identify and exclude noisy samples according to the statistical features of predictive history, which allows retaining informative hard examples. Secondly, we adopt Co-weighting strategy for robust training, which improves Co-teaching algorithm through weighting samples between peer networks. Compared with extensive state-of-the-art methods, our strategy achieves the best performance on two colon tumor histology image datasets under different ratios of noise.",Training;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Noise robustness;Noise measurement;Tumors;Image classification;Noisy labels;classification;predictive history;hard example;robust training,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),10.1109/ICCC51575.2020.9344937
Microscopic Blood Smear RBC Classification using PCA and SVM based Machine Learning,"The therapeutic analysis f microscopic blood smear begins with recognizing blood cells f various categories as well as estimating cell count in blood sample. The distinctive blood cell grading and counting furnish priceless knowledge to the pathologist about sundry infections. This exercise can be easily concluded if the shapes f blood cells are pinpointed first and using the shapes, we classify the blood cells. In this research work we build and test an automatic microscopic blood smear red blood cell (RBC) classification by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based machine learning. We train and test the statistical data models based n probabilistic pattern recognition to classify the blood smear RBC into Normal Cells, Echinocytes, Elliptocytes and Sickle cells.

Algorithms for Automatic Identification and Analysis of Sri Lankan Anopheles Mosquito Species,"Microscopic digital image processing algorithms are presented here to automatically detect primary morphological features of Sri Lankan anopheline mosquitoes, as an essential step towards the development of automated identification and analysis of various species of anopheline mosquitoes. Mosquitoes that belong to genus Anopheles spread the causative pathogen of malaria. Perfect and speedy species identification is crucial in any surveillance and control strategies. Currently, morphological taxonomic keys are used to identify various species. Two or more primary morphological characteristics, such as a number of dark spots of wings and pale bands of legs, are used in each step of the hierarchical key. To achieve the automatic detection of the primary morphological features, image processing algorithms performed at three levels. At the pre-processing level, methods work with raw, possibly noisy pixel values, with noise reduction and smoothing. In the mid-level, algorithms are utilized pre-processing results for further means with background removing and spots/bands segmentation. At the final level, techniques try to extract the semantics of spots/bands and counting the spots/bands from the information provided. Thirty samples of anopheline mosquitoes' wings and legs microscopic images were analysed with satisfactory results.",Legged locomotion;Machine learning algorithms;Microscopy;Veins;Surveillance;Feature extraction;Data mining;Anopheline mosquito species;image processing algorithms;spots identification;rolling ball algorithm,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 2nd International Conference on Advancements in Computing (ICAC),10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357228
Multi-label Detection and Classification of Red Blood Cells in Microscopic Images,"Cell detection and cell type classification from biomedical images play an important role for high-throughput imaging and various clinical application. While classification of single cell sample can be performed with standard computer vision and machine learning methods, analysis of multi-label samples (region containing congregating cells) is more challenging, as separation of individual cells can be difficult (e.g. touching cells) or even impossible (e.g. overlapping cells). As multi-instance images are common in analyzing Red Blood Cell (RBC) for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) diagnosis, we develop and implement a multi-instance cell detection and classification framework to address this challenge. The framework firstly trains a region proposal model based on Region-based Convolutional Network (RCNN) to obtain bounding-boxes of regions potentially containing single or multiple cells from input microscopic images, which are extracted as image patches. High-level image features are then calculated from image patches through a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with ResNet-50 structure. Using these image features inputs, six networks are then trained to make multi-label prediction of whether a given patch contains cells belonging to a specific cell type. As the six networks are trained with image patches consisting of both individual cells and touching/overlapping cells, they can effectively recognize cell types that are presented in multi-instance image samples. Finally, for the purpose of SCD testing, we train another machine learning classifier to predict whether the given image patch contains abnormal cell type based on outputs from the six networks. Testing result of the proposed framework shows that it can achieve good performance in automatic cell detection and classification.",Red blood cells;Microscopy;Transfer learning;Big Data;Standards;Testing;Diseases;sickle cell disease;multi-instance object detection;cell classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377782
Classification of Osteosarcoma Tumor from Histological Image Using Sequential RCNN,"Osteosarcoma is an osseous tumor that occurs in the metaphyseal area around the knee accounts for roughly 20% of bone cancers mostly affects patients younger than 20 years. Early diagnosis of osteosarcoma cancer can pave the way for an unlimited choice of therapy opportunities. Moreover, pathological estimation of necrosis and tumor cells determines the future intensity of chemotherapy radiation to apply to patient. The biopsy confirms the diagnosis and divulges the grade of the tumor, necrotic, and non-tumor cells. Due to a lack of radiologists in third world countries like Bangladesh, it is extremely difficult to diagnose cancer in the early stage. Moreover, to identify the chemotherapy effect during the chemotherapy period, multiple radiologists are required which is quite expensive for most cancer hospitals. In this paper, a Sequential Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model consisting of CNN and bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) is proposed, which performs exceptionally well with small numbers of histopathological osteosarcoma Haematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) stained images despite having the over-fitting problem, heterogeneity, intra-class variation, inter-class similarity, crowded context, the irregular shape of the nucleus and noisy data. Performance of the is compared with that of AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, LeNet and SVM models with the histopathological image dataset on osteosarcoma.",Chemotherapy;Shape;Computational modeling;Logic gates;Feature extraction;Cancer;Tumors;Bidirectional GRU;Osteosarcoma;RCNN,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,2020 11th International Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (ICECE),10.1109/ICECE51571.2020.9393159
Shape-based Image Classification and Identification System for Digital Holograms of Marine Particles and Plankton,"shape-based image analysis system has been developed for classifying and identifying holographic images of plankton and other microscopic marine organisms. The system consists of two parts: imCLASS and imIDENT. imCLASS enables the user to rapidly prepare training data, and then the prepared data can be used to train imIDENT such that it has the ability to automatically classify and identify new images. In our tests, imCLASS took 65.6 s to process 298 raw images, and then 20.1 s to extract and process the features of the images. The processing time of classification of the training data was roughly 17 min. Afterwards the classified training data were used to train imIDENT. This procedure took 49.0 s.

Hieroglyph: Hierarchical Glia Graph Skeletonization and Matching,"Automatic 3D reconstruction of glia morphology is a powerful tool necessary for investigating the role of microglia in neurological disorders in the central nervous system. Current glia skeleton reconstruction techniques fail to capture an accurate tracing of the processes over time, useful for the study of the microglia motility and morphology in the brain during healthy and diseased states. We propose Hieroglyph, a fully automatic temporal 3D skeleton reconstruction algorithm for glia imaged via 3D multiphoton microscopy. Hieroglyph yielded a 21% performance increase compared to state of the art automatic skeleton reconstruction methods and outperforms the state of the art in different measures of consistency on datasets of 3D images of microglia. The results from this method provide a 3D graph and digital reconstruction of glia useful for a myriad of morphological analyses that could impact studies in brain immunology and disease.",Neurological diseases;Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Microscopy;Morphology;Reconstruction algorithms;Tools;3D skeleton;graph theory;reconstruction,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,"2020 54th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers",10.1109/IEEECONF51394.2020.9443372
Adherent Nuclei Edge Detection Based on Caps-Unet,"Accurate nuclei edge detection is a fundamental task of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. Automated detection of nuclei edges, especially the adherent ones, in histopathological images is crucial for splitting adherent nuclei, which is the key of early diagnosis of diseases. For this end, we propose a model named Caps-Unet aiming at accurately and efficiently detecting adherent nuclei edges in H&E stained histopathological images. The Caps-Unet model replaces the ordinary convolutional layers with proposed Capsule layers (Caps-layers for short) in both contracting pathway and expanding pathway of the U-net model. Each Caps-layer consists of four different-scale convolution units and a concatenated unit incorporating the four resulting feature maps. Evaluated experimental results on four different kinds of diseases in MICCAI2017 nuclei segmentation competition dataset show our model has a better performance than the original U-net model and the state-of-the-art TernausNet model.",Solid modeling;Image segmentation;Design automation;Convolution;Image edge detection;Computational modeling;Task analysis;nuclei edge detection;adherent nuclei splitting;deep learning;histopathological image,INPROCEEDINGS,2020,"2020 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)",10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom51426.2020.00137
3-D Particle Surface Reconstruction From Multiview 2-D Images With Structure From Motion and Shape From Shading (January 2020),"Since wear particles usually contain valuable information about lubricant and wear condition of lubricated components, wear debris analysis is widely used to monitor machine/component wear. Current literature reports about the importance and necessity of 3-D surface characterization of wear particles as opposed to 2-D characterization. It may be borne in mind that traditional 3-D analysis has been a synonym only for local surface morphologies for stationary particles. This results in large errors when irregular particles are under observation. A new 3-D imaging methodology is proposed to reconstruct multiview 3-D surfaces for a moving particle whereby the target particle is passed through a microchannel with rolling motion, and recorded via a digital microscope. The multiple moving particles are tracked based on Kalman filter to obtain different-view images. Sparse and dense reconstruction of the particle surfaces are enabled by these images using Structure from Motion (SfM) and Shape from Shading (SfS) methodologies, respectively. The method was verified using real particles and evaluated by the results of laser scanning confocal microscopy. The proposed method is able to reconstruct wear particles under various perspectives, and the errors from the characterization parameters of the areal are less than 20%.",Three-dimensional displays;Surface morphology;Image reconstruction;Surface reconstruction;Feature extraction;Surface topography;Two dimensional displays;Shape from shading (SfS);structure from motion (SfM);3-D feature extraction;wear debris analysis (WDA),ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,10.1109/TIE.2020.2970681
Pose Sensing and Servo Control of the Compliant Nanopositioners Based on Microscopic Vision,"This article presents new pose sensing and servo control techniques for the compliant nanopositioners (CNPs) based on optical microscopic vision. A visual pose tracking algorithm (VPTA) and a visual servo positioning scheme (VSPS) that both utilize iterative template matching are presented. In the VPTA, to realize pose sensing of the CNPs with high performance, an improved Gaussian- Newton optimization method combined with an adaptive penalty strategy is developed. In the VSPS, to realize robust and flexible control of the CNPs, a velocity controller that directly uses the gray value of the template to control the CNP is designed. Simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that the VPTA can achieve pose tracking of the three-degree-of-freedom (x, y, 0) CNPs at a frame rate of hundred hertz, and the dynamic tracking errors are smaller than 100 nm, 160 nm, and 40 μrad in the x-, y-, and 0-axes, respectively. Moreover, by using the proposed VSPS, task-based nanopositioning can be easily realized without extracting features of the object, and the obtained stable positioning accuracies are better than 30 nm, 33 nm, and 3 μrad in the x-, y-, and 0-axes, respectively.",Microscopy;Sensors;Motion measurement;Nanopositioning;Measurement by laser beam;Machine vision;Optical microscopy;Compliant nanopositioners (CNPs);iterative template matching (ITM);microscopic vision;pose sensing;visual control,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,10.1109/TIE.2020.2977572
Visual Analytics for Hypothesis-Driven Exploration in Computational Pathology,"Recent advances in computational and algorithmic power are evolving the field of medical imaging rapidly. In cancer research, many new directions are sought to characterize patients with additional imaging features derived from radiology and pathology images. The emerging field of Computational Pathology targets the high-throughput extraction and analysis of the spatial distribution of cells from digital histopathology images. The associated morphological and architectural features allow researchers to quantify and characterize new imaging biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. However, while the image feature space grows, exploration and analysis become more difficult and ineffective. There is a need for dedicated interfaces for interactive data manipulation and visual analysis of computational pathology and clinical data. For this purpose, we present IIComPath, a visual analytics approach that enables clinical researchers to formulate hypotheses and create computational pathology pipelines involving cohort construction, spatial analysis of image-derived features, and cohort analysis. We demonstrate our approach through use cases that investigate the prognostic value of current diagnostic features and new computational pathology biomarkers.",Pathology;Tumors;Feature extraction;Cancer;Visual analytics;Biomedical imaging;Biomarkers;Visual analytics;computational pathology;breast cancer;hypothesis-driven exploration,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,10.1109/TVCG.2020.2990336
CoMHisP: A Novel Feature Extractor for Histopathological Image Classification Based on Fuzzy SVM With Within-Class Relative Density,"Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for pattern recognition. Traditional ML algorithms have limited ability to reveal the most sophisticated features of cancer histopathological images, but their robustness and fault tolerance can be enhanced by using fuzzy modeling to capture the uncertainty in image data. Therefore, this article proposes a novel CoMHisP framework based on a fuzzy support vector machine with within-class density information (FSVM-WD). It utilizes a novel feature extraction technique by optimizing the block size to extract image micropatterns and computing center of mass (CoM) for each pixel to extract feature vectors. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a CMTHis dataset comprising histopathological images of canine mammary tumor (CMT), a prevalent neoplastic disease in female dogs, and an established model for human breast cancer. Data analysis reveals that stain normalization and magnification influence the performance of the CoMHisP framework, with the best results achieved at lower magnifications after stain normalization. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 97.25% ($\pm$1.80%) using a FSVM-WD classifier, outperforming both traditional ML and deep FE-VGGNET16-based feature descriptors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a CoM-based feature descriptor has been proposed for histopathological image analysis of CMTs and its performance was evaluated using a fuzzy SVM-based classifier. The proposed method performs well with datasets of limited size and low-magnification images and, therefore, has the potential to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis in low-cost clinical settings.",Feature extraction;Tumors;Support vector machines;Image analysis;Breast cancer;Uncertainty;Canine mammary tumors (CMTs);center of mass (CoM);feature engineering;fuzzy membership;fuzzy support vector machine with relative density;histopathological image classification,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,10.1109/TFUZZ.2020.2995968
Multifractal Alterations in Oral Sub-Epithelial Connective Tissue During Progression of Pre-Cancer and Cancer,"Bright-field microscopy (BFM) encrypts the optical transillumination profile of the transmitted light attenuated by the complex micro-structural tissue convolutions, manifested by the dense and compact regions of the specimen under examination. The connotations of idiosyncratic tissue interaction dynamics with the onset of pre-cancerous activity are encoded in the BFM acquired oral mucosa histopathological images (OMHI). In the present study, our analysis is focused on the sub-epithelium region of the oral mucosa, which has high clinical significance but sparsely explored in the literature from the textural domain. Histopathology being the gold-standard technique till date, we have used the light microscopic histopathology images for tissue characterization. The tissue-index transmission patches (TITP) from the sub-epithelium region are cropped under the guidance of oral onco-pathologists. After that, the TITPs are characterized for its multi-scale spatial-deformation dynamics, while keeping the intrinsic anisotropic geometry, and local contour connectivity within tolerable limits. With recent studies exhibiting multifractal's potency in diverse biological system analysis, here, we exploit the 2D multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (2D-MFDFA) on TITPs for exploring a discriminative set of multifractal signatures for healthy, oral potentially malignant disorders and oral cancer tissue sample. The predictive model's competency is validated on an experimentally collected corpus of TITP samples and substantiated via confirmatory data statistics and analysis, showing its inter-class segregation efficacy. Moreover, the 2D-MFDFA analysis evinces the complex multifractal patterns in TITPs, which is due to the presence of composite long-range correlations in the oral mucosa tissue fabric.",Cancer;Fractals;Microscopy;Biopsy;Connective tissue;Optical microscopy;Lesions;Oral cancer;oral potentially malignant disorders;bright-field microscopy;sub-epithelium;multifractal,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2020.2997875
Neuromuscular Password-Based User Authentication,"In this article, we propose a novel neuromuscular password-based user authentication method. The method consists of two parts: surface electromyogram (sEMG) based finger muscle isometric contraction password (FMICP) and neuromuscular biometrics. FMICP can be entered through isometric contraction of different finger muscles in a prescribed order without actual finger movement, which makes it difficult for observers to obtain the password. In our study, the isometric contraction patterns of different finger muscles were recognized through high-density sEMG signals acquired from the right dorsal hand. Moreover, both time-frequency-space domain features at macroscopic level (interference-pattern EMG) and motor neuron firing rate features at microscopic level (via decomposition) were extracted to represent neuromuscular biometrics, serving as a second defense. The FMICP and macro-micro neuromuscular biometrics together form a neuromuscular password. The proposed neuromuscular password achieved an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0128 when impostors entered a wrong FMICP. Even when impostors entered the correct FMICP, the neuromuscular biometrics, as the second defense, inhibited impostors with an EER of 0.1496. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use individually unique neuromuscular information during unobservable muscle isometric contractions for user authentication, with training and testing data acquired on different days.",Neuromuscular;Password;Biometrics (access control);Authentication;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Biometrics;high-density surface electromyogram (sEMG);machine learning;neuromuscular password;user authentication,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,10.1109/TII.2020.3001612
Deriving Polarimetry Feature Parameters to Characterize Microstructural Features in Histological Sections of Breast Tissues,"Objective: Mueller matrix polarimetry technique has been regarded as a powerful tool for probing the microstructural information of tissues. The multiplying of cells and remodeling of collagen fibers in breast carcinoma tissues have been reported to be related to patient survival and prognosis, and they give rise to observable patterns in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections of typical breast tissues (TBTs) that the pathologist can label as three distinctive pathological features (DPFs)-cell nuclei, aligned collagen, and disorganized collagen. The aim of this paper is to propose a pixel-based extraction approach of polarimetry feature parameters (PFPs) using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. These parameters provide quantitative characterization of the three DPFs in four types of TBTs. Methods: The LDA-based training method learns to find the most simplified linear combination from polarimetry basis parameters (PBPs) constrained under the accuracy remains constant to characterize the specific microstructural feature quantitatively in TBTs. Results: We present results from a cohort of 32 clinical patients with analysis of 224 regions-of-interest. The characterization accuracy for PFPs ranges from 0.82 to 0.91. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the ability of PFPs to quantitatively characterize the DPFs in the H&E pathological sections of TBTs. Significance: This technique paves the way for automatic and quantitative evaluation of specific microstructural features in histopathological digitalization and computer-aided diagnosis.",Breast;Pathology;Polarimetry;Training;Imaging;Cancer;Microstructure;Breast pathological features;LDA classifier;polarimetry feature parameters;quantitative characterization,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2020.3019755
Tracking Neutrophil Migration in Zebrafish Model Using Multi-Channel Feature Learning,"Tracking cells over time is crucial in the fields of computer vision and biomedical science. Studying neutrophils and their migratory profile is the highly topical fields in inflammation research due to determining role of these cells during immune responses. As neutrophils generally are of various shapes and motion, it remains challenging to track and describe their behaviours from multi-dimensional microscopy datasets. In this study, we propose a robust novel multi-channel feature learning (MCFL) model inspired by deep learning to extract the complex behaviour of neutrophils moved in time lapse images. In this model, the convolutional neural networks along with cell relocation distance and orientation channels learn the robust significant spatial and temporal features of an individual neutrophil. Additionally, we also proposed a new cell tracking framework to detect and track neutrophils in the original time-laps microscopy images, entails sampling, observation, and visualisation functions. Our proposed cell tracking-based-multi channel feature learning method has remarkable performance in rectifying common cell tracking problem compared with state-of the-art methods.",Tracking;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Visualization;Biology;Training;Immune cells;multi-channel feature learning;cell tracking;convolutional neural networks;deep learning,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2020.3019271
PDAM: A Panoptic-Level Feature Alignment Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Instance Segmentation in Microscopy Images,"In this work, we present an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method, named Panoptic Domain Adaptive Mask R-CNN (PDAM), for unsupervised instance segmentation in microscopy images. Since there currently lack methods particularly for UDA instance segmentation, we first design a Domain Adaptive Mask R-CNN (DAM) as the baseline, with cross-domain feature alignment at the image and instance levels. In addition to the image- and instance-level domain discrepancy, there also exists domain bias at the semantic level in the contextual information. Next, we, therefore, design a semantic segmentation branch with a domain discriminator to bridge the domain gap at the contextual level. By integrating the semantic- and instance-level feature adaptation, our method aligns the cross-domain features at the panoptic level. Third, we propose a task re-weighting mechanism to assign trade-off weights for the detection and segmentation loss functions. The task re-weighting mechanism solves the domain bias issue by alleviating the task learning for some iterations when the features contain source-specific factors. Furthermore, we design a feature similarity maximization mechanism to facilitate instance-level feature adaptation from the perspective of representational learning. Different from the typical feature alignment methods, our feature similarity maximization mechanism separates the domain-invariant and domain-specific features by enlarging their feature distribution dependency. Experimental results on three UDA instance segmentation scenarios with five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PDAM method, which outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods by a large margin.",Image segmentation;Semantics;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Training;Adaptation models;Unsupervised domain adaptation;instance segmentation;microscopy images,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2020.3023466
Weakly Supervised Histopathology Image Segmentation With Sparse Point Annotations,"Digital histopathology image segmentation can facilitate computer-assisted cancer diagnostics. Given the difficulty of obtaining manual annotations, weak supervision is more suitable for the task than full supervision is. However, most weakly supervised models are not ideal for handling severe intra-class heterogeneity and inter-class homogeneity in histopathology images. Therefore, we propose a novel end-to-end weakly supervised learning framework named WESUP. With only sparse point annotations, it performs accurate segmentation and exhibits good generalizability. The training phase comprises two major parts, hierarchical feature representation and deep dynamic label propagation. The former uses superpixels to capture local details and global context from the convolutional feature maps obtained via transfer learning. The latter recognizes the manifold structure of the hierarchical features and identifies potential targets with the sparse annotations. Moreover, these two parts are trained jointly to improve the performance of the whole framework. To further boost test performance, pixel-wise inference is adopted for finer prediction. As demonstrated by experimental results, WESUP is able to largely resolve the confusion between histological foreground and background. It outperforms several state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on a variety of histopathology datasets with minimal annotation efforts. Trained by very sparse point annotations, WESUP can even beat an advanced fully supervised segmentation network.",Image segmentation;Training;Manifolds;Manuals;Task analysis;Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Convolutional neural networks;histopathology image segmentation;weakly supervised learning;manifold;label propagation,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2020.3024262
DetexNet: Accurately Diagnosing Frequent and Challenging Pediatric Malignant Tumors,"The most frequent extracranial solid tumors of childhood, named peripheral neuroblastic tumors (pNTs), are very challenging to diagnose due to their diversified categories and varying forms. Auxiliary diagnosis methods of such pediatric malignant cancers are highly needed to provide pathologists assistance and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis before treatments. In this paper, inspired by the particularity of microscopic pathology images, we integrate neural networks with the texture energy measure (TEM) and propose a novel network architecture named DetexNet (deep texture network). This method enforces the low-level representation pattern clearer via embedding the expert knowledge as prior, so that the network can seize the key information of a relatively small pathological dataset more smoothly. By applying and finetuning TEM filters in the bottom layer of a network, we greatly improve the performance of the baseline. We further pre-train the model on unlabeled data with an auto-encoder architecture and implement a color space conversion on input images. Two kinds of experiments under different assumptions in the condition of limited training data are performed, and in both of them, the proposed method achieves the best performance compared with other state-of-the-art models and doctor diagnosis.",Feature extraction;Tumors;Pathology;Cancer;Neural networks;Task analysis;Pediatrics;Assistant pathology diagnosis;deep learning;feature filtering;pediatric cancer,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2020.3027547
On the Application Possibility of Thermal Barrier Coatings in Space Practices,"Recently, application of ceramic coatings to space vehicles to generate thermal barriers upon re-entry is being considered as a challenge for research. Conventionally, thermal barrier coatings (TBC) are utilized to increase the gas turbine engine components' thermal and oxidation resistance values in order to get higher power and efficiency values. In this study, various superalloys and stainless steels were thermal barrier coated using the atmospheric plasma spraying method. One goal is to determine the effect of the substrate on the performance of the coating. Coating morphology was determined using microscopy analysis. Various heat exposure procedures were applied to the specimens and the changes in the mechanical properties of the top coat were analyzed using indentation techniques. Durability of the coatings after various periods at 1100degC was examined. Microstructures, coatings and reaction products were characterized by optical microscopy and image analysis. Effects of TBC thickness variations were also analyzed in order to achieve a model for determining the optimum coating thickness.",Coatings;Thermal resistance;Thermal spraying;Optical microscopy;Ceramics;Space vehicles;Turbines;Engines;Oxidation;Steel,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 3rd International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies,10.1109/RAST.2007.4283968
Study of Cellular Adhesion with Scanning Acoustic Microscopy,"A mechanical scanning acoustic reflection microscope was applied to living cells (e.g., osteoblasts) to observe their undisguised shapes and to evaluate their adhesive conditions at a substrate interface. A conditioned medium was collected from a bone-metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and cultured with an immature osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1. To characterize the cellular adhesion, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were cultured with or without MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium for 2 days, then assayed with the scanning acoustic reflection microscope. At 600 MHz the scanning acoustic reflection microscope clearly indicated that MC3T3-E1 cells cultured with MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium had both an abnormal shape and poor adhesion at the substrate interface. The results arc compared with those obtained with laser scanning con- focal microscopy and are supported by a simple multilayer model.",Adhesives;Cells (biology);Breast cancer;Optical microscopy;Metastasis;Acoustic reflection;Shape;Bone tissue;Lesions;Vehicles,ARTICLE,2007,"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control",10.1109/TUFFC.2007.420
Fuzzy temporal random sets with an application to cell biology,"Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) greatly facilitates to imaging the first steps of endocytosis, a process whereby cells traffic cargo from the cell surface to endosomes. Using TIRFM, fluorescent-tagged endocytic proteins are observed as overlapped areas forming random clumps of different sizes, shapes and durations. A common procedure to segment these objects consists of thresholding the original gray-level images to produce binary sequences in which a pixel is covered or not by a given fluorescent-tagged protein. This binary logic is not appropriate because it leaves a free tuning parameter to be set by the user which can influence on the conclusions of the statistical analysis. Instead, we have adopted a more realistic approach, in which segmented binary images are modelled as a fuzzy temporal random set. Here, we propose some measures of spatio-temporal interactions based on the fuzzy counterparts of the pair-correlation function and the Ripley K-function. We used a randomization procedure to test for independence. Our results show that this procedure will permit biologists to examine and quantify the interactions between endocytic proteins robustly.",Fuzzy sets;Biological cells;Fluorescence;Proteins;Image segmentation;Reflection;Microscopy;Shape;Binary sequences;Pixel,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems Conference,10.1109/FUZZY.2007.4295484
A fuzzy rule based approach to identify biomarkers for diagnostic classification of cancers,"An important problem for doctors is to identify a small set of useful biomarkers (not all related genes) that can discriminate between different subgroups of cancers which appear similar in routine histology. Here we propose a method for simultaneous feature/gene selection and rule generation for the same problem. Since the feature selection method is integrated into the rule base tuning, it can account for possible subtle nonlinear interaction between features as well as that between features and the tool, and hence can identify a useful set of features for the task at hand. We applied our method to find biomarkers for a group of four childhood cancers that is collectively known as small round blue cell tumors. For this data set first we have used a neural network to reduce the dimension of the data and then applied our method to find biomarkers and rules. Our system could find only eight genes including a novel gene that can do the diagnostic prediction task with a high accuracy. The system can be extended to non-classification applications also.",Biomarkers;Cancer;Machine learning;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy sets;Neural networks;Knowledge based systems;Humans;Neoplasms;Gene expression;Identification of Biomarkers;Fuzzy rules;Cancer Subgroups;Gene Selection,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems Conference,10.1109/FUZZY.2007.4295533

The device is shown to be capable of individually adjusting the position and the focal length of liquid micro-lenses. Measurements of the focal length as a function of applied voltage are presented.

Investigation of Methodologies for the Segmentation of Squamous Epithelium from Cervical Histological Virtual Slides,"This paper investigates image segmentation methods for the automated identification of Squamous epithelium from cervical virtual slides. Such images can be up to 120Ktimes80K pixels in size. Through investigation a multiresolution segmentation strategy was developed to give the best segmentation results in addition to saving processing time and memory. Squamous epithelium is initially segmented at a low resolution of 2X magnification. The boundaries of segmented Squamous epithelium are further fine tuned at the highest resolution of 40X magnification. Robust texture feature vectors were developed in conjunction with a support vector machine (SVM) to do classification. Finally medical histology rules are applied to remove misclassifications. Results show that with selected texture features, SVM achieved more than 92.1% accuracy in testing.

Recognition of Unstained Live Drosophila Cells in Microscope Images,"In order to localise tagged proteins in living cells, the surrounding cells must be recognised first. Based on previous work regarding cell recognition in bright-field images, we propose an approach to the automated recognition of unstained live Drosophila cells, which are of high biological relevance. In order to achieve this goal, the original methods were extended to enable the additional application of an alternative microscopy technique, since the exclusive usage of bright-field images does not allow for an accurate segmentation of the considered cells. In order to cope with the increased number of parameters to be set, a genetic algorithm is applied. Furthermore, the employed segmentation and classification techniques needed to be adapted to the new cell characteristics. Therefore, a modified active contour approach and an enhanced feature set, allowing for a more detailed description of the obtained segments, are introduced.",Image recognition;Microscopy;Proteins;Fluorescence;Cells (biology);Image segmentation;Genetics;Organisms;Optical attenuators;Optical refraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (IMVIP 2007),10.1109/IMVIP.2007.16
Multifeature Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Gleason Grading of Histological Images,"We present a study of image features for cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading of the histological images of prostate. In diagnosis, the tissue image is classified into the tumor and nontumor classes. In Gleason grading, which characterizes tumor aggressiveness, the image is classified as containing a low- or high-grade tumor. The image sets used in this paper consisted of 367 and 268 color images for the diagnosis and Gleason grading problems, respectively, and were captured from representative areas of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue retrieved from tissue microarray cores or whole sections. The primary contribution of this paper is to aggregate color, texture, and morphometric cues at the global and histological object levels for classification. Features representing different visual cues were combined in a supervised learning framework. We compared the performance of Gaussian, -nearest neighbor, and support vector machine classifiers together with the sequential forward feature selection algorithm. On diagnosis, using a five-fold cross-validation estimate, an accuracy of 96.7% was obtained. On Gleason grading, the achieved accuracy of classification into low- and high-grade classes was 81.0%.",Prostate cancer;Neoplasms;Glands;Laboratories;Color;Image retrieval;Biological tissues;Aggregates;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Computer-aided diagnosis;Gleason grading;prostate cancer;statistical pattern recognition,ARTICLE,2007,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2007.898536
Segmentation of Squamous Epithelium from Ultra-large Cervical Histological Virtual Slides,"Cervical virtual slides are ultra-large, can have size up to 120 K times 80 K pixels. This paper introduces an image segmentation method for the automated identification of Squamous epithelium from such virtual slides. In order to produce the best segmentation results, in addition to saving processing time and memory, a multiresolution segmentation strategy was developed. The Squamous epithelium layer is first segmented at a low resolution (2X magnification). The boundaries of segmented Squamous epithelium are further fine tuned at the highest resolution of 40X magnification, using an iterative boundary expanding-shrinking method. The block- based segmentation method uses robust texture feature vectors in combination with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform classification. Medical histology rules are finally applied to remove misclassifications. Results demonstrate that, with typical virtual slides, classification accuracies of between 94.9% and 96.3% are achieved.",Image segmentation;Cervical cancer;Pixel;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Pathology;Biological tissues;Image resolution;Biomedical imaging;Glass,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352405
Cell-Graph Mining for Breast Tissue Modeling and Classification,"We consider the problem of automated cancer diagnosis in the context of breast tissues. We present graph theoretical techniques that identify and compute quantitative metrics for tissue characterization and classification. We segment digital images of histopathological tissue samples using k-means algorithm. For each segmented image we generate different cell-graphs using positional coordinates of cells and surrounding matrix components. These cell-graphs have 500-2000 cells(nodes) with 1000-10000 links depending on the tissue and the type of cell-graph being used. We calculate a set of global metrics from cell-graphs and use them as the feature set for learning. We compare our technique, hierarchical cell graphs, with other techniques based on intensity values of images, Delaunay triangulation of the cells, the previous technique we proposed for brain tissue images and with the hybrid approach that we introduce in this paper. Among the compared techniques, hierarchical-graph approach gives 81.8% accuracy whereas we obtain 61.0%, 54.1% and 75.9% accuracy with intensity-based features, Delaunay triangulation and our previous technique, respectively.",Breast tissue;Breast neoplasms;Breast cancer;USA Councils;Image segmentation;Lymph nodes;Pixel;Mass spectroscopy;Computer science;Biomedical engineering,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353540
Shape Characterization of Extracted and Simulated Tumor Samples using Topological and Geometric Measures,"The prognosis of cancer patients suffering from solid tumors significantly depends on the developmental stage of the tumor. For cervix carcinoma the prognosis is better for compact shapes than for diffusive shapes since the latter may already indicate invasion, the stage in tumor progression that precedes the formation of metastases. In this paper, we present methods for describing and evaluating tumor objects and their surfaces based on topological and geometric properties. For geometry, statistics of the binary object's distance transform are used to evaluate the tumor's invasion front. In addition, a simple compactness measure is adapted to 3D images and presented to compare different types of tumor samples. As a topological measure, the Betti numbers are calculated of voxelized tumor objects based on a medial axis transform. We further illustrate how these geometric and topological properties can be used for a quantitative comparison of histological material and single-cell-based tumor growth simulations.",Shape measurement;Solid modeling;Neoplasms;Skeleton;Cancer;Computational modeling;Medical treatment;Surface morphology;Geometry;Statistics,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353789
A Color-Based Approach for Automated Segmentation in Tumor Tissue Classification,"This paper presents a new color-based approach for automated segmentation and classification of tumor tissues from microscopic images. The method comprises three stages: (1) color normalization to reduce the quality variation of tissue image within samples from individual subjects or from different subjects; (2) automatic sampling from tissue image to eliminate tedious and time-consuming steps; and (3) principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize color features in accordance with a standard set of training data. We evaluate the algorithm by comparing the performance of the proposed fully-automated method against semi-automated procedures. Experimental studies show consist agreement between the two methods. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides an effective tool for evaluating oral cancer images. It can also be applied to other microscopic images prepared with the same type of tissue staining.",Neoplasms;Cancer;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Image color analysis;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Biomedical imaging;Sun;Image sampling,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353866
A K-Means Segmentation Method for Finding 2-D Object Areas Based on 3-D Image Stacks Obtained by Confocal Microscopy,"A segmentation method for three-dimensional image stacks obtained by confocal microscopy is proposed.

As a case study, the proposed method is applied to 244 image stacks of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Segmentation of Folds in Tissue Section Images,"An automated image analysis method for identifying folds in tissue section images is presented. Tissue folding is a common artifact in histological images. Folding artifacts form when tissue folds over twice or more when placing it on the microscope slide. As analyzing cell nuclei automatically, the existence of these artifacts causes algorithms easily to give false output. Thus, their identification is essential in order to obtain reliable analysis. The proposed multistage algorithm consists of three phases. First, the section image is converted to HSI color-space and the saturation and intensity components are processed in order to enhance the discrimination of the objective pixels. Next, segmentation is performed using k- means clustering and the cluster containing fold pixels is extracted from the others. Finally, unavoidable segmentation errors caused mostly by the nuclei of similar characteristics with folds are corrected based on the size and component values of the faulty segmented objects. The method is tested on different tissue section images and the results are compared with manually obtained ones with promising results.",Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Microscopy;Signal processing algorithms;Image converters;Biological materials;Image analysis;Signal processing;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353626
Segmentation of Cells from 3-D Confocal Images of Live Zebrafish Embryo,"In this paper, we use partial-differential-equation-based segmentation to accurately extract the shapes of membranes and nuclei from time lapse confocal microscopy images, taken throughout early zebrafish embryogenesis. This strategy is a prerequisite for an accurate quantitative analysis of cell shape and morphodynamics during organogenesis and is the basis for an integrated understanding of biological processes. This data will also serve for the measurement of the variability between individuals in a population.

An Investigation into the Feasibility of Detecting Microscopic Disease Using Machine Learning,"The prognosis for many cancers could be improved dramatically if they could be detected while still at the microscopic disease stage. We are investigating the possibility of detecting microscopic disease using machine learning approaches based on features derived from gene expression levels and metabolic profiles. We use immunochemistry and QRT-PCR to measure the gene expression profiles from a number of antigens such as cyclin E, P27KIP1, FHIT, Ki-67, PCNA, Bax, Bcl-2, P53, Fas, FasL and hTERT in several particular types of neuroendocrine tumors such as pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas; and the adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), adenomas (ACA), and hyperplasia (ACH) in Cushing's syndrome. We provide statistical evidence that, higher expression levels of hTERT, PCNA and Ki-67 etc. are associated with a higher risk that the tumors are malignant or borderline, as opposed to benign. We also investigated whether higher expression levels of the P27KIP and FHIT etc. are associated with a decreased risk of adrenomedullary tumors. While no significant difference was found between cell-arrest antigens such as P27KIP1 for malignant, borderline, and benign tumors, there was a significant difference between expression levels of such antigens in normal adrenal medulla samples and in adrenomedullary tumors.",Microscopy;Diseases;Machine learning;Cancer;Bioinformatics;Neoplasms;Biomedical engineering;USA Councils;Humans;Books,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering,10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375535
Trabecular Metal Patella Implanted into Soft-Tissue in a Post-Patellectomized Knee A Case Report,"Clinical performance and microscopic analysis of a porous tantalum patella, retrieved from a 34-year-old male patient eight months after implantation is reported. The patellar component was sectioned and microscopically analyzed to determine the extent and characteristics of the soft tissue ingrowth. The metallic tantalum represented 20 vol.% of the analyzed patellar component. Large and small spherical pores were identified. Only the large pores had tissue ingrowth, where 92% of the pores were filled with tissue. The interconnected characteristic of the large pores apparently aided the tissue ingrowth. Sixty-four percent of the entire volume had tissue ingrowth. Total ingrowth was to the extent of 80%. From the perspective of tissue ingrowth, the study supports the porous tantalum for clinical applications and warrants continued investigation. This is the first report of which the authors are aware that evaluates the extent of soft tissue ingrowth in a human retrieved trabecular metal patella.",Knee;Biological tissues;Microscopy;Humans;Bones;Orthopedic surgery;Implants;Performance analysis;Biological materials;Pain;tantalum;patella;arthroplasty;knee;microscopy;retrieveal analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering,10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375616
A Computer Aided Tool for the Assessment of Human Sperm Morphology,"Sperm morphology has a key role in the determination of fertility in men. Nowadays assessments of sperm morphology are mostly done with subjective criteria. This article discusses details of the stages implemented in a computer aided tool for the objective analysis of human sperm morphology, commonly known as Automated Sperm Morphology Analyzer (ASMA). The first stage described is the detection and extraction of individual spermatozoon of an image containing multiple spermatozoa and biological rests as well. A novel method for segmenting objects in microscopic images into its constituent's parts is proposed. The method called nth-fusion introduced in this paper is the framework of the segmentation algorithm implemented in this computer aided tool, this algorithm has been tested with a 250 spermatozoon images database and the results are quite accurate.

A Study on Real Time Estimation Viability of Cells Based on DIC,"Based on the morphological differences between normal, apoptosis and necrosis cell, a method on real time estimation viability of cells based on DIC(differential interference contrast) microscopy is presented in the paper. The Jurkat cell samples were used for investigation the relationship between morphological parameters and cell viabilities in the paper. According to the scatter charts of Jurkat cell roundness, radius ratio and area, the cell areas were mainly distributed from 40 μm2 to 80 μm2. And the areas of apoptosis and necrosis cell were distributed in other range, i.e. larger areas or fewer areas. Not any chemical medicaments need to add in the samples by the method presented in the paper in order to get the viability of cells. The survival rate of Jurkat cells and the percentages of death cells in different death modes after ALA-PDT was estimated by the method presented in the paper. The experiment results showed that not only the results of survival rate of Jurkat cells estimated by the method presented in the paper were consistent with the results estimated by accepted MTT method, but also the percentages of death cells in different death modes can be got on real time by the method presented in the paper.",Biomedical engineering;Optical scattering;Pathogens;Laboratories;Physics education;Educational technology;Biomedical optical imaging;Interference;Optical microscopy;Chemicals;DIC;morphological parameters;cell viability,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering,10.1109/ICCME.2007.4381908
Segmentation and Detection of Nuclei in Silver Stained Cell Specimens for Early Cancer Diagnosis,"For successful cure, cancer has to be detected as early as possible. Since cancer starts from a single cell, this can best be done using cytopathological methods. One important diagnostically relevant measure is the proliferation rate of the cells, which can be estimated from segmented silver stained nuclei. However, the microscopy images of silver stained specimens vary strongly in intensity and contrast and are furthermore compromised by an overall texture. We show that a precise segmentation of the nuclei is possible using a two-step approach. First, an oversegmentation with the mean shift algorithm is obtained. In a second step, these regions are merged to objects, guided by a suitable shape model, viz an ellipse, but simultaneously allowing deviations from this shape model. The segmentation results are compared to a gold standard of 8617 nuclei from 23 specimens of the thyroid gland, achieving a mean areal segmentation error of DeltaA macrnucleus = 12mum2 per nucleus.",Cancer detection;Silver;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Shape;Clustering algorithms;Biomedical measurements;Nuclear measurements;Glands;Area measurement;silver stain;microscopy images;nuclear segmentation;mean shift algorithm;region grouping,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379518
A Variational Approach to Exploit Prior Information in Object-Background Segregation: Application to Retinal Images,"One of the main challenges in image segmentation is to adapt prior knowledge about the objects/regions that are likely to be present in an image, in order to obtain more precise detection and recognition. Typical applications of such knowledge-based segmentation include partitioning satellite images and microscopy images, where the context is generally well defined. In particular, we present an approach that exploits the knowledge about foreground and background information given in a reference image, in segmenting images containing similar objects or regions. This problem is presented within a variational framework, where cost functions based on pair-wise pixel similarities are minimized. This is perhaps one of the first attempts in using non-shape based prior information within a segmentation framework. We validate the proposed method to segment the outer nuclear layer (ONL) in retinal images. This approach successfully segments the ONL within an image and enables further quantitative analysis.",Retina;Image segmentation;Cost function;Level set;Application software;Object detection;Microscopy;Image analysis;Shape;Pixel;Region-based image segmentation;variational methods;level sets;bioimage analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379521

Carbon Nanotubes Coated Acoustic and Optical VOCs Sensors: Towards the Tailoring of the Sensing Performances,"This work is focused on the room temperature sensitivities and response times analysis against aromatic volatile organic compounds of both silica optical fiber and quartz crystal microbalance sensors, coated by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) Langmuir-Blodgett multilayers as highly sensitive nanomaterials. The fabricated samples have been characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, silica optical fiber, and quartz crystal microbalance transducers have been simultaneously exposed at room temperature to toluene and xylene individual vapors in the ppm range. For each transducer type, a time division multiplexing approach has been exploited, enabling the simultaneous interrogation of up to 8 optical and 6 acoustic probes, respectively. The results obtained indicate that both optical and acoustic sensors provide very high reproducibility and sensitivity either towards toluene or xylene, with a resolution of few hundreds of ppb. Furthermore, sensitivities and response times turned out to be dependent on the particular analytes used for the vapors testing. Both transducer types demonstrate a similar response time, while with regard the recovery time, the optical detection seems to be significantly faster than the electrical counterpart. The effect of the SWCNTs monolayers number on sensors sensitivity and response time has also been investigated, demonstrating the possibility to enhance the performances of the proposed transducers by tailoring the geometric properties of the sensitive nanomaterial.",Optical sensors;Carbon nanotubes;Gas detectors;Acoustic sensors;Delay;Optical microscopy;Temperature sensors;Acoustic transducers;Silicon compounds;Optical fibers;Carbon nanotubes;LB deposition;optical fiber VOC sensor;QCM acoustic VOC sensor;Carbon nanotubes;LB deposition;optical fiber VOC sensor;QCM acoustic VOC sensor,ARTICLE,2007,IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology,10.1109/TNANO.2007.907843
Numerical simulation of continuum generation in a multimode nonlinear waveguide,"Continuum generation in large multimode nonlinear waveguides offers the exciting prospect of a new generation of compact, integrated, and high-power broadband light sources. Recently a novel technique based on scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) has been adopted for the observation of continuum generation in such systems with subwavelength resolution.This revealed several interesting aspects of continuum generation, e.g., that the spectral broadening induced by optical nonlinearity depends not only on the distance of propagation but also on the location across the waveguide. Moreover the spectral broadening along the waveguide is slower than in the case of a single-mode waveguide and the spectral width may even decrease over short distances. We have now developed a multimode numerical simulation for nonlinear pulse propagation in order to explain such features.",Numerical simulation;Optical waveguides;Nonlinear optics;Optical films;Optical pumping;Milling machines;Optical refraction;Optical variables control;Optical microscopy;Optical propagation,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and the International Quantum Electronics Conference,10.1109/CLEOE-IQEC.2007.4386146

3-D axon structure extraction and analysis in confocal fluorescence microscopy images,"In this paper, we propose a highly automated 3D centerline extraction tool to assist 3D microscopy image analysis to extract morphological features of the neuronal structures.

Our approach combines 3D Dynamic Programming (DP) technique and marker controlled watershed algorithm to solve this problem.

Spatial-Spectral Density Peaks-Based Discriminant Analysis for Membranous Nephropathy Classification Using Microscopic Hyperspectral Images,"The traditional differential diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) mainly relies on clinical symptoms, serological examination and optical renal biopsy. However, there is a probability of false positives in the optical inspection results, and it is unable to detect the change of biochemical components, which poses an obstacle to pathogenic mechanism analysis. Microscopic hyperspectral imaging can reveal detailed component information of immune complexes, but the high dimensionality of microscopic hyperspectral image brings difficulties and challenges to image processing and disease diagnosis. In this paper, a novel classification framework, including spatial-spectral density peaks-based discriminant analysis (SSDP), is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of MN using a microscopic hyperspectral pathological dataset. SSDP constructs a set of graphs describing intrinsic structure of MHSI in both spatial and spectral domains by employing density peak clustering. In the process of graph embedding, low-dimensional features with important diagnostic information in the immune complex are obtained by compacting the spatial-spectral local intra-class pixels while separating the spectral inter-class pixels. For the MN recognition task, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify pixels in the low-dimensional space. Experimental validation data employ two types of MN that are difficult to distinguish with optical microscope, including primary MN and hepatitis B virus-associated MN. Experimental results show that the proposed SSDP achieves a sensitivity of 99.36%, which has potential clinical value for automatic diagnosis of MN.",Microscopy;Hyperspectral imaging;Immune system;Germanium;Diseases;Optical microscopy;Classification;dimensionality reduction;membranous nephropathy diagnosis;microscopic hyperspectral imaging,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3050483
Multifractal Texture Analysis of Salivary Fern Pattern for Oral Pre-Cancers and Cancer Assessment,"Saliva has emerged as an efficient screening sample for early stage detection of oral cancer (OC) owing to non-invasiveness coupled with high sensitivity and specificity. Although spectroscopic characterization of saliva in oral potentially malignant disorders OPMDs) and OC is extensively studied, its potential as imaging biomarker is sparsely explored. Further, the literature on crystalline pattern of saliva for other diseases or different physiological conditions is mostly qualitative. This paper proposed multifractal based methodology to quantitatively study alteration of the salivary fern pattern in different OPMDs and OC in relation to normal counterpart. The fern pattern of dried saliva is captured by stereo-zoom microscope in reflective mode and an image dataset is developed. We resort to two dimensional multi-fractal detrended fluctuation analysis (2d MFDFA) to elucidate the complexity and heterogeneity of these micro-structured patterns. Existence of multifractal nature embedded in salivary fern has been validated for the first time. Long range spatial correlation is found to be the origin of multifractality. Variation in multi-scale self-similarity of irregular pattern in different study groups is demonstrated by four features extracted from MFDFA.

Accuracy Improvement in Binary and Multi-Class Classification of Breast Histopathology Images,"Breast cancer is widely common in women. In order to recognize this type of cancer, experienced pathologists must evaluate cell shapes in breast histopathology images in different magnification levels. However, there are few pathologists per population in many countries, and there is always a possibility of human error. This study represents a deep transfer learning-based model that can improve some of the current state-of-the-art results in both binary and multi-class classification. The presented model has been examined in magnification-dependent and magnification-independent modes. As for multi-class classification, the proposed system grants 94-97% accuracy. In binary classification, the proposed system provides up to 99% accuracy. The results show higher accuracies than past studies in the classification of breast histological images in some cases with the same algorithm and setting for all the measurements.",Image recognition;Histopathology;Shape;Conferences;Sociology;Classification algorithms;Statistics;image classification;Transfer learning;Breast Histopathology image;ResNet50;BreakHis Dataset,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2020 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE),10.1109/ICCE48956.2021.9352142
Molecular Multicolor Multiphoton in Vivo Bioimaging Based on a Direct Diode Pumped Ti:sapphire Oscillator,"Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) including two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation (SHG), coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) is an important tool in biology and medicine to explore the dynamics of cells and to investigate tissue structure in living systems and biopsies. However, MPM still suffers from limited applicability due to the integration of highly sophisticated lasers. In this paper, we introduce our triple-modal multicolor MPM platform employing a single direct diode-pumped femtosecond Kerr-lens-mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator and acquire simultaneously intrinsic co-registered multicolor TPEF, TPEF, SHG and CARS signals in the backward direction. The complexity and by that the footprint as well the cost of the laser are considerably reduced by the direct diode-pumping scheme. In combination with an Yb fiber amplifier such a laser is suited for biomedical applications allowing for detailed morphologic and molecular spectroscopic in vivo investigation. The optimized emission wavelengths of our Ti:sapphire laser and Yb fiber amplifier provide simultaneous excitation at 805 nm, 1050 nm and 911 nm for multicontrast information from exogenous and endogenous fluorophores. We perform in vivo imaging of C. elegans and visualize metabolic changes in zebrafish larvae to investigate the tumor microenvironment with spectral focusing CARS and multicolor TPEF of green fluorescent protein.",Laser excitation;Semiconductor lasers;Pump lasers;Laser mode locking;Automobiles;Power lasers;Microscopy;Biomedical microscopy;biomedical optical imaging;fluorescence;laser applications;light sources;mode locked lasers;nonlinear optics;raman scattering,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/JSTQE.2021.3060289
Interpretability-Driven Sample Selection Using Self Supervised Learning for Disease Classification and Segmentation,"In supervised learning for medical image analysis, sample selection methodologies are fundamental to attain optimum system performance promptly and with minimal expert interactions (e.g. label querying in an active learning setup). In this article we propose a novel sample selection methodology based on deep features leveraging information contained in interpretability saliency maps. In the absence of ground truth labels for informative samples, we use a novel self supervised learning based approach for training a classifier that learns to identify the most informative sample in a given batch of images. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, termed Interpretability-Driven Sample Selection (IDEAL), in an active learning setup aimed at lung disease classification and histopathology image segmentation. We analyze three different approaches to determine sample informativeness from interpretability saliency maps: (i) an observational model stemming from findings on previous uncertainty-based sample selection approaches, (ii) a radiomics-based model, and (iii) a novel data-driven self-supervised approach. We compare IDEAL to other baselines using the publicly available NIH chest X-ray dataset for lung disease classification, and a public histopathology segmentation dataset (GLaS), demonstrating the potential of using interpretability information for sample selection in active learning systems. Results show our proposed self supervised approach outperforms other approaches in selecting informative samples leading to state of the art performance with fewer samples.",Uncertainty;Feature extraction;Histograms;Training;Image segmentation;Histopathology;Entropy;Interpretability;Sample Selection;Self-supervised;Lung disease classification;Histopathology segmentation,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2021.3061724
Sintering of conductive inks on plastic substrates by use of microwave furnaces being suitable for largescale production processes,"This work is about the application of large-scale mi-crowave furnaces being suitable for the sintering of conductive structures deposited on standard plastic parts in industrial processes. The conductive structures are consisting of carbon or silver filled conductive inks. The feasibility of microwave sintering is proved by comparing the specific resistance of structures subjected to microwave sintering with conductive paths on reference samples sintered in a convection furnace. Furthermore, optical microscopy has been employed to inspect the surface morphology of conductive paths sintered by both microwave furnace and convection furnace. It turns out that appropriate microwave sintering depends on the specific way the magnetron power is controlled in the furnace and on the temporal evolution of magnetron power during the sintering process.",Optical microscopy;Furnaces;Microwave devices;Ink;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave imaging;Periodic structures;microwave;sintering;specific resistance;conductive ink;electromagnetic simulation;conductivity;GFRP,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 14th International Congress Molded Interconnect Devices (MID),10.1109/MID50463.2021.9361626
"Low-Cost, Continuous Motion Imaging, Computationally Augmented Whole Slide Imager for Digital Pathology","As digital pathology advances, systems for acquiring Whole Slide Images (WSI) need to become affordable and effective. Current research is majorly reported around the low-throughput stop-and-focus imaging systems that are too slow for clinical use. This work reports a system that acquires well focused images at a high throughput. It reduces the imaging time by an order of magnitude via the carefully engineered implementation of a global shutter camera which allows continuous motion imaging. The second challenge of maintaining good focus comes from three sources: the imperfections induced by low-cost optomechanics, smear surface undulations, and irregularity of the slide surface itself. These are minimized via a tiled-scan method supported by focal mapping, which predicts and achieves best focus on-the-fly. Finally, any remnant defocus is compensated for by a post-acquisition image enhancement method which sharpens the image without disturbing the essential features and color tones. Thus, this system delivers a 15 × 15 mm2 scan in about 3 minutes at a resolution of 0.78 μm with a 40x microscopy objective. The bill of material cost is about US $1300 and hence it would be beneficial for telepathology in resource-constrained scenarios. Also, this device can serve as an enabler of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning algorithms to provide fully automated diagnosis.

Research on Application of Classification Model Based on Stack Generalization in Staging of Cervical Tissue Pathological Images,"Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor that threatens women's health and life. Cervical pathology examination, as the gold standard for cervical cancer diagnosis, provides an important basis for the surgical plan and postoperative follow-up strategy for cervical cancer. Cervical biopsy diagnosis includes normal, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). At present, cervical pathology examination still relies on the doctor's personal clinical experience and subjective judgment, which is time-consuming and may cause misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. In addition, the current intelligent classification of cervical pathological images still has disadvantages such as imperfect classification system and low classification accuracy. Therefore, this experiment uses the ResNet50 model of the convolutional neural network as the feature extractor, and selects the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in Machine Learning to perform cervical tissue pathological images Discrimination, the accuracy of the classification results were 85.83%, 80.33%, and 86.67%. In order to further improve the accuracy of the model and enhance the applicability and stability of the model, this experiment proposes the Stacked Generalization (SK) classification model. The first-layer base learner of the SK classification model selects CNN-KNN, CNN-RF, CNN-SVM, and the second-layer classifier selects Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Among them, MLP makes the final result by learning the classification performance of the base learner for label discrimination, the accuracy of the classification model after ensemble learning is 90.00%. In addition, this experiment uses the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm to amplify the training samples, and the amplified data set has a classification accuracy of 89.17% under the training of the SK classification model. The results show that the SK classification model in this experiment has a high classification ability for cervical histopathological images, and has good generalization ability and robustness.",Pathology;Feature extraction;Cervical cancer;Lesions;Training;Classification algorithms;Support vector machines;Cervical pathology image;ResNet50;machine learning;multilayer perceptron;stacked generalization;SMOTE,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064040
Machine learning based Diagnosis and Classification Of Sickle Cell Anemia in Human RBC,"Anemia is a disease which is caused by the deficiency of red blood cells. The shape of red blood cell changes to sickle or crescent shape in sickle cell anemia disease. The manual inspection of microscopic images is very difficult and time-consuming process. In this research image processing and machine learning techniques is used to automate the process of detection of sickle cells in microscopic images then classify the RBC into three shapes: circular, elongated (sickle cell) and other shape. The microscopic image is pre-processed and Otsu thresholding technique is used for segmentation. Then, Watershed segmentation is applied to separate the overlapped cells. The geometrical, statistical and textural features are extracted from the images. The machine learning classifier random forest, logistic regression naïve baye sand support vector machine is used.

Research on the Auxiliary Classification and Diagnosis of Lung Cancer Subtypes Based on Histopathological Images,"Lung cancer (LC) is one of the most serious cancers threatening human health. Histopathological examination is the gold standard for qualitative and clinical staging of lung tumors. However, the process for doctors to examine thousands of histopathological images is very cumbersome, especially for doctors with less experience. Therefore, objective pathological diagnosis results can effectively help doctors choose the most appropriate treatment mode, thereby improving the survival rate of patients. For the current problem of incomplete experimental subjects in the computer-aided diagnosis of lung cancer subtypes, this study included relatively rare lung adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) samples for the first time, and proposed a computer-aided diagnosis method based on histopathological images of ASC, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Firstly, the multidimensional features of 121 LC histopathological images were extracted, and then the relevant features (Relief) algorithm was used for feature selection. The support vector machines (SVMs) classifier was used to classify LC subtypes, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to make it more intuitive evaluate the generalization ability of the classifier. Finally, through a horizontal comparison with a variety of mainstream classification models, experiments show that the classification effect achieved by the Relief-SVM model is the best. The LUSC-ASC classification accuracy was 73.91%, the LUSC-SCLC classification accuracy was 83.91% and the ASC-SCLC classification accuracy was 73.67%.

Detection of Hotspots in Fluorescence Imaging of Yeast Cell Model used in Neuro-Degenerative Research,"Fluorescence (FL) optical imaging modality is an indispensable tool in biomedical research for the discovery of drugs as well as diagnosis. With recent developments in high throughput microscopy hardware platforms, there is an immense need to match and develop automated image processing tools that can aid clinical pathologists and researchers expedite their workflow and analysis. This plays a crucial role when the volume of samples is immense and the workflow is tedious manually. In this report, we successfully demonstrate the ability of our software tool to very specifically detect hotspots in FL images of yeast-based model systems that are employed specifically for the detection of neurodegenerative disorders in systems biology research.

On Microstructure Estimation Using Flatbed Scanners for Paper Surface-Based Authentication,"Paper surfaces under the microscopic view are observed to be formed by intertwisted wood fibers. Such structures of paper surfaces are unique from one location to another and are almost impossible to duplicate. Previous work used microscopic surface normals to characterize such intrinsic structures as a “fingerprint” of paper for security and forensic applications. In this work, we examine several key research questions of feature extraction in both scientific and engineering aspects to facilitate the deployment of paper surface-based authentication when flatbed scanners are used as the acquisition device. We analytically show that, under the unique optical setup of flatbed scanners, the specular reflection does not play a role in norm map estimation. We verify, using a larger dataset than prior work, that the scanner-acquired norm maps, although blurred, are consistent with those measured by confocal microscopes. We confirm that, when choosing an authentication feature, high spatial-frequency subbands of the heightmap are more powerful than the norm map. Finally, we show that it is possible to empirically calculate the physical dimensions of the paper patch needed to achieve a certain authentication performance in equal error rate (EER). We analytically show that log(EER) is decreasing linearly in the edge length of a paper patch.",Authentication;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Feature extraction;Cameras;Servers;Decoding;Authentication;physically unclonable;paper surface;microstructure;norm map;flatbed scanner;specular reflection,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,10.1109/TIFS.2021.3071585

Crossover Structure Separation With Application to Neuron Tracing in Volumetric Images,"Morphology reconstruction of neurons from 3-D microscopic images is essential to neuroscience research. However, many reconstructions may contain errors and ambiguities because of the crossover neuronal fibers. In this article, an automatic algorithm is proposed for the detection and separation of crossover structures and is applied to neuron tracing for improving the neuron reconstruction results. First, a spherical-patches extraction (SPE)-Net is employed to detect the 3-D neuron crossover points and locate the crossover structures in neuron volumetric images. Second, a multiscale upgraded ray-shooting model (MSURS) is proposed to obtain robust results at different scales with high confidence and is employed to extract the crossover neuronal structure features. Then, a crossover structure separation (CSS) method is developed to eliminate the false connections of crossover structures and generate deformed separated neuronal fibers based on the extracted features to replace the original neurites signals. Experiments demonstrate that the SPE-Net for crossover point detection achieves average precision and recall rates of 73.89% and 79.66%, respectively, and demonstrate the proposed CSS method can improve 20.46% the performance of the reconstructions on average. The results confirm that the proposed method can effectively improve the neuron tracing results in volumetric images.",Neurons;Image reconstruction;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Topology;Two dimensional displays;Morphology;Crossover point detection;crossover structure separation (CSS);multiscale upgraded ray-shooting model (MSURS);neuron tracing;topological precision,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2021.3072119
Morphological and Characteristic Analysis of Upper Aero-Digestive Tract Tumour: Revealing Uncovered Facts in Digital Pathology,"Upper Aero Digestive Tract cancer is treated as the primary cancer type compared to other different cancers. Exploring the morphological behaviour and characteristics of biopsy tissue sample is very significant in tumour grade analysis for proper diagnosis. After all, the manual microscopic tissue analysis process is considered as the golden standard. Traditional pathological study is still challenging and tough to overcome the manual tissue analytical barriers. To develop an efficient automated computer aided system for1. cancer tissue analysis, 2. tumour grade classification and3. survival prediction of cancer patients. The combination of different image vision techniques and microscopic image analysis tools are used to develop the state-of-the-art frameworks which will be efficient to extract different morphological features from different UADT tumours. The extracted biopsy tissue morphological features will be taken for automatic tumour grade classification that helps in assisting the pathologists to overcome the manual microscopic cancer grade classification problems. The state-of-the-art automated tissue analysis framework is developed to extract the features from the tissue samples within the short period of time.

Real-Time Multi-Focus Biomedical Microscopic Image Fusion Based on m-SegNet,"Activity level measurement and fusion rules are the two key factors of image fusion. In the fusion method based on neural networks, the activity level measurements are realized by dividing the image into small blocks and predicting the sharpness of each block; then, the global decision graph guiding fusion is generated according to the predicted results. However, these two tasks are serial in nature, which makes it difficult to complete them simultaneously while achieving satisfactory fusion performance. Therefore, a new multi-focus microscopic image fusion method is proposed in this paper to quickly fuse multiple histological microscopic images from different focusing planes to generate full-focus images. The improved SegNet network was used to detect the unfocused regions. Considering that two or more images are needed for fusion, a parallel fusion strategy is proposed herein to generate clear fusion images based on multiple images instead of pairwise decision graphs. Compared with the convolutional neural network, the proposed network has better representation ability and can extract and fuse the most ideal features to provide a more accurate fusion decision. Compared with the traditional Segnet network, it is lightweight, which greatly improves computing speed and achieves real-time fusion.",Microscopy;Licenses;Image fusion;Image segmentation;Cancer;Biomedical imaging;Wavelet transforms;Histological microscopic image;Segnet network;multi-focus microscopic image fusion;parallel fusion strategy,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Photonics Journal,10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3073022
Learning to segment clustered amoeboid cells from brightfield microscopy via multi-task learning with adaptive weight selection,"Detecting and segmenting individual cells from microscopy images is critical to various life science applications. Traditional cell segmentation tools are often ill-suited for applications in brightfield microscopy due to poor contrast and intensity heterogeneity, and only a small subset are applicable to segment cells in a cluster. In this regard, we introduce a novel supervised technique for cell segmentation in a multitask learning paradigm. A combination of a multi-task loss, based on the region and cell boundary detection, is employed for an improved prediction efficiency of the network. The learning problem is posed in a novel min-max framework which enables adaptive estimation of the hyper-parameters in an automatic fashion. The region and cell boundary predictions are combined via morphological operations and active contour model to segment individual cells. The proposed methodology is particularly suited to segment touching cells from brightfield microscopy images without manual interventions. Quantitatively, we observe an overall Dice score of 0.93 on the validation set, which is an improvement of over 15.9% on a recent unsupervised method, and outperforms the popular supervised U-net algorithm by at least 5.8% on average.",Image segmentation;Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Microscopy;Neural networks;Predictive models;Tools,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412641
Classifying Breast Histopathology Images with a Ductal Instance-Oriented Pipeline,"In this study, we propose the Ductal Instance-Oriented Pipeline (DIOP) that contains a duct-level instance segmentation model, a tissue-level semantic segmentation model, and three-levels of features for diagnostic classification. Based on recent advancements in instance segmentation and the Mask R-CNN model, our duct-level segmenter tries to identify each ductal individual inside a microscopic image; then, it extracts tissue-level information from the identified ductal instances. Leveraging three levels of information obtained from these ductal instances and also the histopathology image, the proposed DIOP outperforms previous approaches (both feature-based and CNN-based) in all diagnostic tasks; for the four-way classification task, the DIOP achieves comparable performance to general pathologists in this unique dataset. The proposed DIOP only takes a few seconds to run in the inference time, which could be used interactively on most modern computers.

Attention Based Multi-Instance Thyroid Cytopathological Diagnosis with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion,"In recent years, deep learning has been popular in combining with cytopathology diagnosis. Using the whole slide images (WSI) scanned by electronic scanners at clinics, researchers have developed many algorithms to classify the slide (benign or malignant). However, the key area that support the diagnosis result can be relatively small in a thyroid WSI, and only the global label can be acquired, which make the direct use of the strongly supervised learning framework infeasible. What's more, because the clinical diagnosis of the thyroid cells requires the use of visual features in different scales, a generic feature extraction way may not achieve good performance. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised multi-instance learning framework based on attention mechanism with multi-scale feature fusion (MSF) using convolutional neural network (CNN) for thyroid cytopathological diagnosis. We take each WSI as a bag, each bag contains multiple instances which are the different regions of the WSI, our framework is trained to learn the key area automatically and make the classification. We also propose a feature fusion structure, merge the low-level features into the final feature map and add an instance-level attention module in it, which improves the classification accuracy. Our model is trained and tested on the collected clinical data, reaches the accuracy of 93.2 %, which outperforms the other existing methods. We also tested our model on a public histopathology dataset and achieves better result than the state-of-the-art deep multi-instance method.",Deep learning;Visualization;Histopathology;Supervised learning;Feature extraction;Data models;Pattern recognition,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9413184
Breast Tumor Segmentation using U-NET,"Cancer stands in second leading cause of death worldwide, an average of one in six deaths is due to cancer. The occurrence of breast cancer is more in women compared to men. Breast cancer signs are of a breast lump, differences in the nipples or breasts form or texture etc. Its therapy based on the cancer stages. Early detection of cancer will reduce the death risk for patients. The paper's target is to detect the breast cancer area. To give accurate treatment for the patients, symptoms should be observed properly, and a prediction automatic system is needed that will classify the tumor into benign or malignant. As a general convolutional neural network its role focuses on the classification of images, where input is an image and output are one label, but in biomedical cases, not only does it enable us to discern whether a disease occurs, but also to locate the region of abnormality. U-Net is devoted to solving this problem. This research work has proposed a UNET based architecture for segmentation of tumor region in histopathological images. The network is depending on a fully convolutional network and its design is updated and expanded to operate with less pictures of training and to create more accurate segmentations.

An Efficient Paper Anti-Counterfeiting Method Based on Microstructure Orientation Estimation,"Forgery of paper invoices and certificates negatively causes huge economic loss every year. In the molding process of paper, plant fibres inside will distribute randomly and form the unique microscopic surface. Accordingly, forensic researchers have presented many techniques to build its feature descriptor for paper anti-counterfeiting. Among those methods, normal vector field and reconstructed surface based on multi-view photos captured by mobile camera have indicated incredibly effectiveness and practicality. However, the inefficiency of existing models using mobile camera is the neck in real time detection scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the efficient microstructure orientation estimation of paper surface for authentication. To address this problem, we investigate the reflection characteristics of rough surface and quantify the light attenuation accurately. Then, we model the entire propagation path of light emitted by flash, and exploit single photo captured by mobile camera to reconstruct microscopic inclination based on beam energy loss. Reduction of required pictures significantly enhances forensics efficiency. Through comparison experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method can be used for paper discrimination effectively with speedy feature extraction.",Optical fibers;Surface reconstruction;Optical microscopy;Microscopy;Biological system modeling;Cameras;Surface roughness;Paper anti-counterfeiting;mobile camera;microstructure orientation estimation;light attenuation;forensics efficiency,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,"ICASSP 2021 - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9415114
Weakly Supervised Neuron Reconstruction From Optical Microscopy Images With Morphological Priors,"Manually labeling neurons from high-resolution but noisy and low-contrast optical microscopy (OM) images is tedious. As a result, the lack of annotated data poses a key challenge when applying deep learning techniques for reconstructing neurons from noisy and low-contrast OM images. While traditional tracing methods provide a possible way to efficiently generate labels for supervised network training, the generated pseudo-labels contain many noisy and incorrect labels, which lead to severe performance degradation. On the other hand, the publicly available dataset, BigNeuron, provides a large number of single 3D neurons that are reconstructed using various imaging paradigms and tracing methods. Though the raw OM images are not fully available for these neurons, they convey essential morphological priors for complex 3D neuron structures. In this paper, we propose a new approach to exploit morphological priors from neurons that have been reconstructed for training a deep neural network to extract neuron signals from OM images. We integrate a deep segmentation network in a generative adversarial network (GAN), expecting the segmentation network to be weakly supervised by pseudo-labels at the pixel level while utilizing the supervision of previously reconstructed neurons at the morphology level. In our morphological-prior-guided neuron reconstruction GAN, named MP-NRGAN, the segmentation network extracts neuron signals from raw images, and the discriminator network encourages the extracted neurons to follow the morphology distribution of reconstructed neurons. Comprehensive experiments on the public VISoR-40 dataset and BigNeuron dataset demonstrate that our proposed MP-NRGAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with less training effort.",Neurons;Image reconstruction;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Morphology;Generative adversarial networks;Training;Neuron reconstruction;optical micros-copy;generative adversarial network;weakly supervised,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2021.3080695
Skin Melanoma Detection in Microscopic Images Using HMM-Based Asymmetric Analysis and Expectation Maximization,"Melanoma is one of the deadliest types of skin cancer with increasing incidence. The most definitive diagnosis method is the histopathological examination of the tissue sample. In this paper, a melanoma detection algorithm is proposed based on decision-level fusion and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), whose parameters are optimized using Expectation Maximization (EM) and asymmetric analysis. The texture heterogeneity of the samples is determined using asymmetric analysis. A fusion-based HMM classifier trained using EM is introduced. For this purpose, a novel texture feature is extracted based on two local binary patterns, namely local difference pattern (LDP) and statistical histogram features of the microscopic image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed melanoma detection algorithm yields a total error of less than 0.04%.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Melanoma;Hidden Markov models;Skin;Histograms;Epidermis;Melanoma;Local Binary Pattern;Hidden Markov Model-based EM;Decision-level fusion,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3081185
Automated Segmentation Of Corneal Nerves In Confocal Microscopy Via Contrastive Learning Based Synthesis And Quality Enhancement,"Precise quantification of the corneal nerve plexus morphology is of great importance in diagnosing peripheral diabetic neuropathy and assessing the progression of various eye-related systemic diseases, wherein segmentation of corneal nerves is an essential component. In this paper, we proposed and validated a novel pipeline for corneal nerve segmentation, comprising corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) image synthesis, image quality enhancement and nerve segmentation. Our goal was to address three major problems existing in most CCM datasets, namely inaccurate annotations, non-uniform illumination and contrast variations. In our synthesis and enhancement steps, we employed multilayer and patchwise contrastive learning based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) frameworks, which took full advantage of multi-scale local features. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments on two publicly available CCM datasets, our pipeline has achieved overwhelming enhancement performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the segmentation results showed that models trained on our synthetic images performed much better than those trained on a real CCM dataset, which clearly identified the effectiveness of our synthesis method. Overall, our proposed pipeline can achieve satisfactory segmentation performance for poor-quality CCM images without using any manual labels and can effectively enhance those images.",Image quality;Image segmentation;Image synthesis;Microscopy;Pipelines;Morphology;Lighting;Corneal nerve segmentation;contrastive learning;dataset synthesis;quality enhancement;corneal confocal microscopy.,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9433955
Unsupervised Neural Tracing In Densely Labeled Multispectral Brainbow Images,"Recent advances in imaging technologies for generating large quantities of high-resolution 3D images, especially multispectral labeling technology such as Brainbow, permits unambiguous differentiation of neighboring neurons in a densely labeled brain. This enables, for the first time, the possibility of studying the connectivity between many neurons from a light microscopy image. The lack of reliable automated neuron morphology reconstruction, however, makes data analysis the bottleneck of extracting rich informatics in neuroscience. Supervoxel-based neuron segmentation methods have been proposed to solve this problem, however, previous approaches have been impeded by the large numbers of errors which arise in the final segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised approach to trace neurons from multispectral Brainbow images, which prevents segmentation errors and tracing continuity errors using two innovations: First, we formulate a Gaussian mixture model-based clustering strategy to improve the separation of segmented color channels that provides accurate skeletons for the next steps. Then, a skeleton graph approach is proposed to allow the identification and correction of discontinuities in the neuron tree topology. We find that these innovations allow better performance over current state-of-the-art approaches, which results in more accurate neuron tracing results close to human expert annotation.",Image segmentation;Technological innovation;Three-dimensional displays;Neuroscience;Microscopy;Neurons;Morphology;neuron tracing;neuron segmentation;Brainbow images,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9433932
Automatic Multi Class Organelle Segmentation For Cellular Fib-Sem Images,"Focused Ion Beam milling combined with Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) technique is an electron microscopy imaging method that offers the possibility of acquiring 3D isotropic images of biological structures at the nanometric scale. Automated image segmentation is required for morphological analysis of huge image stacks and to save time consuming manual intervention. Current methods are either specific to data and organelles or lack accuracy. We propose a robust multi-class semantic segmentation method for FIBSEM images, based on deep neural networks.

Fast Whole Slide Image Analysis Of Cervical Cancer Using Weak Annotation,"Cervical cancer is the most common gynecological disease, which seriously endangers women's health. Histopathological diagnosis is the most reliable determinant for cervical cancer prognosis and treatment. However, it is a time-consuming and error-prone task for pathologists to manually analyze the whole slide image(WSI). Automated detection of cancer tissue and histopathological diagnosis are of great signification to reduce the workload for pathologists. So we proposed a method combining deep learning(DL) and traditional machine learning(ML) to realize the rapid analysis of the cervical cancer WSI. Our method first applied a patch-level network to detect the pathological patches and generate a heatmap that can highlight the tumor area. Considering the difficulty of obtaining pixel-level annotations, we designed a weak annotation strategy for training the network and verified the feasibility of this strategy on a public dataset. Besides, we used overlapping heatmap generation strategy(Overlapping HMGS) and feature sharing strategy of fully convolutional neural networks(CNN) to balance the accuracy and speed of tumor region detection. Then features extracted from the heatmaps are fed into a traditional machine learning model for the WSI-level prediction. Our approach not only achieved excellent performance with 97% accuracy on our cervical cancer WSI dataset, but it is also efficient and interpretable.",Heating systems;Training;Annotations;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Reliability;Task analysis;Cervical Cancer;Deep Learning;Weak Annotation;Whole Slide Image,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9433964
Three Dimensional Synthetic Non-Ellipsoidal Nuclei Volume Generation Using Bézier Curves,"Automated segmentation of cell nuclei is used to analyze individual cells to determine the number of nuclei in a 3D volume. Deep learning approaches that segment nuclei require large amounts of annotated (ground truth) microscopy volumes for training. In many cases acquiring large amounts of annotated volumes may not be possible and data augmentation methods must be used. One approach has been the use of synthetic volumes for training. Alternate methods employ spherical and ellipsoidal nuclear models for synthetic ground truth generation, resulting in segmentation that does not accurately match nuclei morphology. In this paper, we present a technique to generate synthetic non-ellipsoidal nuclei microscopy images using Bézier Curves. We test our approach by training a modified 3D U-Net. Our results indicates that our synthetic non-ellipsoidal nuclei approach achieves improved segmentation on volumes with irregularly shaped nuclei.",Training;Deep learning;Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Microscopy;Morphology;Generative adversarial networks;synthetic nuclei generation;generative adversarial network;machine learning;segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434149
Contrastive Representation Learning For Whole Brain Cytoarchitectonic Mapping In Histological Human Brain Sections,"Cytoarchitectonic maps provide microstructural reference parcellations of the brain, describing its organization in terms of the spatial arrangement of neuronal cell bodies as measured from histological tissue sections. Recent work provided the first automatic segmentations of cytoarchitectonic areas in the visual system using Convolutional Neural Networks. We aim to extend this approach to become applicable to a wider range of brain areas, envisioning a solution for mapping the complete human brain. Inspired by recent success in image classification, we propose a contrastive learning objective for encoding microscopic image patches into robust microstructural features, which are efficient for cytoarchitectonic area classification. We show that a model pre-trained using this learning task outperforms a model trained from scratch, as well as a model pre-trained on a recently proposed auxiliary task.

Comparative Study Of Voxel-Based Statistical Analysis Methods For Fluorescently Labelled And Light Sheet Imaged Whole-Brain Samples,"Light sheet microscopy of fluorescently labelled and optically cleared intact organs is a novel approach which enables to visualize structure and function of the brain in 3D. The methodology is gaining popularity in the neuroscience community and dedicated algorithms are being developed for segmenting and quantifying different neurological markers. However, comparisons of marker characteristics between the study groups are conventionally performed by conducting statistical testing for every atlas-defined brain region. While this statistical approach yields viable results, it is biased by the region delineations and does not provide information on the signal properties at a voxel level. In this work, we convert the 3D histological signal from segmented c-Fos + cells into a format suitable for conducting voxel-wise group comparisons and demonstrate the potential of a recent technique, probabilistic threshold-free cluster enhancement method, in a brief comparative study of six different approaches to voxel-based statistical analysis.",Three-dimensional displays;Optical microscopy;Statistical analysis;Shape;Microscopy;Fluorescence;Probabilistic logic;threshold free cluster enhancement;voxel-based;statistics;light sheet fluorescence microscopy;iDISCO,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434015
Self Adversarial Attack as an Augmentation Method for Immunohistochemical Stainings,"It has been shown that unpaired image-to-image translation methods constrained by cycle-consistency hide the information necessary for accurate input reconstruction as imperceptible noise. We demonstrate that, when applied to histopathology data, this hidden noise appears to be related to stain specific features and show that this is the case with two immune-histochemical stainings during translation to Periodic acid-Schiff(PAS), a histochemical staining method commonly applied in renal pathology. Moreover, by perturbing this hidden information, the translation models produce different, plausible outputs. We demonstrate that this property can be used as an augmentation method which, in a case of supervised glomeruli segmentation, leads to improved performance.",Image segmentation;Histopathology;Image reconstruction;Immune system;Biomedical imaging;digital pathology;image-to-image translation;cycle-consistency;self adversarial attack,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9433838
Exploring Genetic-histologic Relationships in Breast Cancer,"The advent of digital pathology presents opportunities for computer vision for fast, accurate, and objective solutions for histopathological images and aid in knowledge discovery. This work uses deep learning to predict genomic biomarkers- TP53 mutation, PlK3CA mutation, ER status, PR status, HER2 status, and intrinsic subtypes, from breast cancer histopathology images. Furthermore, we attempt to understand the underlying morphology as to how these genomic biomarkers manifest in images. Since gene sequencing is expensive, not always available, or even feasible, predicting these biomarkers from images would help in diagnosis, prognosis, and effective treatment planning. We outperform the existing works with a minimum improvement of 0.02 and a maximum of 0.13 AUROC scores across all tasks. We also gain insights that can serve as hypotheses for further experimentations, including the presence of lymphocytes and karyorrhexis.

AURA-net uses transfer learning to accelerate training and Attention mechanisms to help the network focus on relevant image features. In this way, it can be trained efficiently with a very limited amount of annotations. Our network can thus be used to automate the segmentation of datasets that are generally considered too small for deep learning techniques. AURA-net also uses a loss inspired by active contours that is well-adapted to the specificity of phase-contrast images, further improving performance. We show that AURA-net outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in several small (less than 100 images) datasets.",Training;Deep learning;Image segmentation;Annotations;Microscopy;Transfer learning;Interference;Bioimage analysis;segmentation;machine learning;convolutional neural networks;phase-contrast microscopy,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9433993
Astute Segmentation and Classification of leucocytes in blood microscopic smear images using titivated K-means clustering and robust SVM techniques,"The microscopic smear images of blood are the images obtained through blood tests. So, by obtaining these images through blood tests, we can be identifying the number of diseases. As these image samples be will be in a huge number making the manual segmentation process will be more difficult and resulting in error. So here we have giving a solution of automatic segmentation for those huge sample sizes and resulting in the minimization of errors. As we know that the blood consists of three types of blood cells which are RBC that is Red blood cells, WBC means White blood cells and the platelets. So, in this category of blood cells White blood cells (WBC) are the important blood cells as they are the disease defenders and they give us a lot of scope for developing a new variety of technologies for detection and the classification of these types of blood cells i.e., WBC's. So, in our work we are using computer-based methods for the segmentation and classification process. In the line of methodology, the process involved are first the data is to be preprocessed and then the processed data is to be segmented followed by the extraction of features of the data and at the end the data is classified into 5 categories of WBC's that are easonophil, monocyte, nuetrophil, basinophil, lymphocyte.

Detection of Blood Cancer-Leukemia using K-means Algorithm,"Blood cancer (Leukemia) is one of the leading causes of death among humans. The pace of healing depends mainly on early detection and diagnosis of a disease. The main reason behind occurrence of Leukemia is when bone marrow produces a lot of abnormal white blood cells this happens. Microscopic study on images is done by Hematologists who make use of human blood samples, from which it leads to the requirement of following methods, which are microscopic color imaging, image segmentation, clustering and classification which allows easy identification of patients suffering from this disease. Microscopic imaging allows for various methods of detecting blood cancer in visible and immature white blood cells. Identifying Leukemia early and quickly greatly helps practitioners in providing appropriate treatment to patients. Initially to start with, Segmentation stage is achieved by segregating white blood cells from other blood components i.e. erythrocytes and platelets by using Statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation. For diagnosing prediction of Leukemia, geometrical features such as area, perimeter of the white blood cell nucleuses investigated.

A dynamic-thresholding image segmentation algorithm for ceramic images based on Convolutional regression model,"For the microscopic image of multiphase ceramics, the shape and size of the crystal grain in the traditional material electron microscopy images are manually marked by the researcher, its efficiency is poor. Because of the irregular texture on the crystal grain, it will cause large errors due to the large difference between the pixel value and the pixel attribute in the neighborhood by the traditional segmentation method. In this paper, a dynamic-thresholding image segmentation algorithm for multi-phase ceramic micro-images is presented. First of all, based on gradient image, it considers how to select the optimal threshold as the image label. Then, due to the sample is insufficient, it must meet the training requirements of the machine learning model, so it obtains pixel-level training samples from the labeled image, and use the modified convolution regression model to complete dynamic threshold automatic labeling to achieve image segmentation. From the experimental results, the algorithm accurately recognizes the weak edges of the ceramic image, while avoiding excessive noise, and the segmentation effect is significantly better than other algorithms. The accuracy of the model of automatically marking threshold is also higher than the other two models.",Training;Image segmentation;Machine learning algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Image edge detection;Feature extraction;Ceramics;ceramic micro-image;dynamic-thresholding;Convolutional Neural Network;image segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,"2021 International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering (CISCE)",10.1109/CISCE52179.2021.9445994
Style Consistent Image Generation for Nuclei Instance Segmentation,"In medical image analysis, one limitation of the application of machine learning is the insufficient amount of data with detailed annotation, due primarily to high cost. Another impediment is the domain gap observed between images from different organs and different collections. The differences are even more challenging for the nuclei instance segmentation, where images have significant nuclei stain distribution variations and complex pleomorphisms (sizes and shapes). In this work, we generate style consistent histopathology images for nuclei instance segmentation. We set up a novel instance segmentation framework that integrates a generator and discriminator into the segmentation pipeline with adversarial training to generalize nuclei instances and texture patterns. A segmentation net detects and segments both real nuclei and synthetic nuclei and provides feedback so that the generator can synthesize images that can boost the segmentation performance.

An Efficient Breast Cancer Analysis Technique by Using a Combination of HOG and Canny Edge Detection Techniques,"Breast cancer is a common and frequent cancer among women all over the world and one of the major causes of cancer related deaths. Early and timely detection of breast cancer plays a key role for the proper treatment of the disease. Pathological diagnosis of such cancer is a very important part and if applied in an effective manner would save a lot of lives. The diagnosis includes the analysis of histopathological images of the cancer cells and it is a tedious task and requires a certain level of expertise. This paper proposes a machine learning approach to analyse the histopathological images of breast tissues and shows an improved technique for the detection of malignant (cancerous) cells. Feature extraction from images plays the central role in image processing. A combination of Histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) and Canny Edge detection technique is applied for extracting features which are then reduced by applying Principal component analysis. Classification algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Adaboost are used to train the proposed model.

Histological Image Segmentation and Classification Using Entropy-Based Convolutional Module,"As the powerful performance of deep learning has been proven, many computer vision researchers have applied deep learning methods to their works as a breakthrough that could not be achieved with conventional computer vision algorithms. Particularly in pathological image analysis, deep learning plays an important role because some diagnosis requires a considerable cost or much time. In a recent, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning models have shown meaningful results in pathological image analysis, reducing time and cost. However, existing CNN-based segmentation models perform the same convolution operation for all channels of a feature map. It could be an inefficient operation according to information theory. We propose (Shannon) entropy-based convolutional module (ECM) for efficient convolutional operation in terms of a communication system. The fundamental coding manner of a communication system based on information theory is to allocate fewer bits for data showing the high probability of occurrence, and vice versa. Following up this coding manner, a feature is divided into dominant and recessive features according to the channel importance calculated from the channel attention module, and a heavy operation is conducted on the recessive feature and a light operation is conducted on the dominant feature. This operating manner can make a network perform efficient calculations and improve its performance. Furthermore, our proposed module is a portable unit, thus it can be a replacement of any convolution without modification of the whole architecture. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed module is the first trial to mimic the coding manner of information theory. The models equipped with our proposed module outperform the original models achieving 0.855 of F1 score and 0.832 of Jaccard score on colorectal cancer (CRC) image data-set.",Deep learning;Image segmentation;Electronic countermeasures;Convolution;Channel coding;Communication systems;Solid modeling;Segmentation;deep learning;information theory;Shannon entropy;colorectal cancer image,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091578
Evaluation of Histopathological Images Segmentation Techniques for Breast Cancer Detection,"Breast cancer classification and detection using histopathological images is considered a difficult process due to the complexity of the characteristics of histopathology images. This paper presents an automated system for the classification and detection of breast cancer from microscopic histological images where the images are classified into benign, in situ, invasive, and normal. The proposed approach involves several steps which are image preprocessing (Enhancement), image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and finally image classification. The proposed approach utilizes and compares two segmentation methods which are clustering and Global thresholding using Otsu's method. Initially, images are segmented using K-means and Global thresholding methods. Then, features (morphological and texture) are extracted from the images for the two methods. Moreover, feature selection is done by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, K-means and Global thresholding methods are compared in the classification process by using different classifiers.

Prediction of ki-67 expression level based on non-small cell lung cancer,"The tumor immunohistochemical marker ki-67 is an important marker of cell proliferation, and an important prognostic factor for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CT radiomics features can reflect potential histopathological changes without trauma. The lesions are segmented by a radiomics physician, the 3D reconstructions are performed and 107 radiomics features are extracted. The correlation between CT radiomics features based on NSCLC and ki-67 is analyzed and 45 features are selected. Then we perform factor analysis to further select features.

A Polarization-Imaging-Based Machine Learning Framework for Quantitative Pathological Diagnosis of Cervical Precancerous Lesions,"Polarization images encode high resolution microstructural information even at low resolution. We propose a framework combining polarization imaging and traditional microscopy imaging, constructing a dual-modality machine learning framework that is not only accurate but also generalizable and interpretable. We demonstrate the viability of our proposed framework using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grading task, providing a polarimetry feature parameter to quantitatively characterize microstructural variations with lesion progression in hematoxylin-eosin-stained pathological sections of cervical precancerous tissues. By taking advantages of polarization imaging techniques and machine learning methods, the model enables interpretable and quantitative diagnosis of cervical precancerous lesion cases with improved sensitivity and accuracy in a low-resolution and wide-field system. The proposed framework applies routine image-analysis technology to identify the macro-structure and segment the target region in H&E-stained pathological images, and then employs emerging polarization method to extract the micro-structure information of the target region, which intends to expand the boundary of the current image-heavy digital pathology, bringing new possibilities for quantitative medical diagnosis.",Pathology;Imaging;Lesions;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Task analysis;Cervical precancerous tissues;dual-modality machine learning;polarization imaging;quantitative pathological diagnosis,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2021.3097200

A New Subspace Multi-Objective Approach for the Clustering and Selection of Regions of Interests in Histopathological Images,"Histopathology images represent a source of assistance for pathologists when diagnosing Cancer. However, in histopathology or in cancer image analysis, pathologists mostly diagnose the pathology as positive if a small part of it is considered cancer tissue. These small parts are called regions of interest (ROI) or patches. Finding the relevant patches is crucial as it can save computation time and memory. Subspace clustering discovers clusters embedded in multiple, overlapping subspaces of high dimensional data. It is an extension of feature selection, which tries to identify relevant subsets of features that are relevant to the clustering process. However, subspace clustering algorithms provide a partition of the data based on one cluster validity measure, assuming a homogeneous similarity measure over the entire data set makes the algorithms not robust to variations in the data characteristics. Therefore, it is beneficial to optimize multiple validity indices simultaneously to capture different aspects of the datasets. The goal of Multi-Objective clustering methods (MOC) is to derive significant clusters by applying two or more objective functions. This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm for patch selection based on subspace and multi-objective clustering to find the data’s best partitioning and the images’ most relevant patches.",Image analysis;Histopathology;Statistical analysis;Clustering algorithms;Evolutionary computation;Linear programming;Feature extraction;Subspace clustering;Multi-objective clustering;Histopathological images;Patch selection,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC),10.1109/CEC45853.2021.9504811
Feature Fusion Ensemble Architecture With Active Learning For Microscopic Blood Smear Analysis,"The blood smear analysis provides vital information and forms the basis to diagnose most of the diseases. With recent developments, deep learning methods can analyze the microscopic blood sample using image processing and classification tasks with less human effort and increased accuracy. In this work, embarking upon domain-specific feature extraction and active learning, we propose a compact, yet efficient feature fusion ensemble-based architecture for WBC sub-class classification and WBC disease identification which can automate and speed up the process of blood smear analysis with the help of digital image slide scanners.The proposed architecture is a three-stage multi-channel architecture with shallow feature inputs, deep feature extractors, and classification stages, respectively. The trainable parameters are quite less in our architecture when compared to deeper networks like ResNet 152, VGG19, which are the State of the Art (SOTA) methods [1], [2], [3]. However, labeling large medical data sets has been challenging and very costly. To mitigate huge labeling requirements and costs, Active Learning is employed to train this architecture and demonstrated much higher accuracy with quite less labeled data than SOTA. The proposed approach is shown to be quite general and yields better performance in terms of accuracy in WBC classification and Disease identification as well, with much fewer labeled samples for training, when compared with recent approaches employing deeper models.",Training;Optical microscopy;Microscopy;Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Labeling;Task analysis;Blood smear;WBC Classification;Machine Learning;CNNs;Active Learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506535
Nuclear Density Distribution Feature for Improving Cervical Histopathological Images Recognition,"Cervical carcinoma is a common type of cancer in the female reproductive system. Early detection and diagnosis can facilitate immediate treatment and prevent progression of the disease. However, in order to achieve better performance, DL-based algorithms just stack various layers with low interpretability. In this paper, a robust and reliable Nuclear Density Distribution Feature (NDDF) based on priors of the pathologists to promote the Cervical Histopathological Image Classification (CHIC) is proposed. Our proposed method combines the nucleus mask segmented by U-Net with the segmentation grid-lines generated from pathology images utilizing SLIC to obtain the NDDF map, which contains information about the morphology, size, number, and spatial distribution of nuclei. The result shows that the proposed model trained with NDDF maps has better performance and accuracy than that trained on RGB images (patch-level histopathological images). More significantly, the accuracy of the two-stream network trained with RGB images and NDDF maps is steadily improved over the corresponding baselines of different complexity.",Pathology;Image segmentation;Image recognition;Graphical models;Morphology;Feature extraction;Complexity theory;Nuclear Density Distribution;Superpixel;Deep Learning;Histopathological Image Classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506093
Su-Sampling Based Active Learning For Large-Scale Histopathology Image,"Expensive annotation cost has always been a critical obstacle in deep learning systems, in particular for the applications requiring domain experts’ knowledge, such as medical image analysis. Active learning has attracted widespread attention by decreasing the quantity and difficulty in annotation with query strategies. To make a query for labeling, contextual features of candidates’ relation are often considered essential. In this paper, we propose an innovative method that incorporating spatial distribution approximation in the uncertainty sampling for whole-slide histopathology image annotation. The active query selection combines the measure of spatial representativeness and histopathological tissue informativeness. With the assumption that the labeling cost of individual instances is non-biased, we use three independent features, namely loss prediction query, Monte Carlo distribution query, and loss estimation enhanced by spatial information for the active learning task.

Empirically, the proposed method can outperform the other annotation strategies on the histopathology datasets.

Liver Protection Activity of Sunkist Orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) Peels in Cyclophosphamide Induced Male Wistar Rat,"Cyclophosphamide is one of the potential immunosuppressive agents with high efficacy in low doses which has a toxic effect on the liver due to its reactive metabolites. Sunkist (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) peel is a potential natural source that can neutralize liver toxicity from these agents due to the several phytochemicals content. This study was designed to explore the liver protective effect of Sunkist (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) peels against cyclophosphamide. In the experiment, about 15 male Wistar rats grouped into five groups: normal, control, Sunkist-I, Sunkist-II, and Sunkist-III were included. The dose of cyclophosphamide was 200 mg/kg BW; while the dose of Sunkist Ethanol Extract ranged from 200-800 mg/kg BW. Evaluation of the protective effect was carried out using histopathological features as parameters. The experimental results showed that moderate degree of necrosis was found in the control group while the normal group did not show any pathological changes. On the other hand, an increase in the ethanolic extract of the Sunkist peel showed recovery of necrosis in central venous congestion. Overall, the ethanolic extract of Sunkist peels showed an improvement in histology of liver tissue against cyclophosphamide.",Toxicology;Histopathology;Ethanol;Liver;Rats;Feature extraction;Compounds;Sunkist peels;cyclophosphamide;liver;necrosis;congestion,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,"2021 IEEE International Conference on Health, Instrumentation & Measurement, and Natural Sciences (InHeNce)",10.1109/InHeNce52833.2021.9537213
Structural imaging of keratoconic human corneas using polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation microscopy,"Multiphoton microscopy has revolutionized three-dimensional (3D) imaging of biological tissues by offering new modes of contrast even in unstained tissues. Notably, second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy enables the visualization of fibrillar collagen without any labelling and with unequalled sensitivity and specificity [1] . Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals and the main component of connective tissues, such as arteries, skin, bone or cornea. The size and the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of collagen fibrils are key distinctive features of every tissue that are crucial for its functional behaviour, notably its mechanical properties. Any disruption of this 3D structure may result in a pathological dysfunction of the tissue. In this context, polarization-resolved SHG (P-SHG) microscopy has been shown to provide a more accurate characterization of the 3D organization of collagen [2] , [3] because the SHG signal is higher when the excitation electric field is parallel to the dipoles accounting for the nonlinear optical response. The acquisition of a series of SHG images recorded with linear incident polarizations of various orientations thus provides the orientation of collagen fibrils in every pixel, using appropriate data processing based on a tensorial analysis of collagen response. This advanced multiphoton modality has been used in many tissues, including cornea that is composed of thin collagen fibrils aligned within 1–3 µm thick lamellae superimposed along the depth of the cornea, parallel to its surface [2] .",Proteins;Pathology;Three-dimensional displays;Cornea;Biological tissues;Organizations;Sensitivity and specificity,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC52157.2021.9541583
Tailoring spatial entropy in extreme ultraviolet focused beams for multispectral ptychography,"Microscopy with coherent extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and soft-X-ray radiation is a promising diagnostic tool for nanoscience. High-harmonic generation (HHG) sources are becoming a mature table-top source for EUV and soft-X-ray radiation. HHG sources naturally produce broad EUV and soft-X-ray spectra, making them intrinsically suited for spectrally-resolved microscopy. This is particularly interesting because many materials possess unique absorption characteristics in this short-wavelength range. However, focusing and shaping polychromatic EUV radiation for microscopy experiments remains challenging due to the fact that most elements across the periodic table exhibit high absorption and low refractive index contrast, which makes manufacturing good refractive optics such as lenses very difficult. A promising technique capable of simultaneous wavefront sensing and quantitative phase contrast microscopy is ptychography [1] , as the large amount of redundant information available in ptychography allows for polychromatic reconstructions with monochromatic detectors [2] . This is particularly useful for imaging experiments with HHG sources, where polychromatic operation offers largely increased flux. Studies have indicated that a ptychography reconstruction benefits from structured illumination probes [3] - [5] .","Materials, elements, and compounds;Optical microscopy;Absorption;Ultraviolet sources;Microscopy;Refractive index;Tools",INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC52157.2021.9541668

Information Analysis for Quantum Imaging Optimization,"Quantum imaging emerged quite recently as a breakthrough technology of overcoming the diffraction limit in microscopy and enhancement of optical resolution without the necessity to use hard radiation or perform scanning in the near field [1] , [2] . Both, the quantum imaging itself and the more “classical” techniques inspired by it (for example, super-resolution optical fluctuations imaging – SOFI [3] ), rely on detection and analysis of photon (intensity) correlations. Typically, it is believed that the more correlated illuminating light is used and the higher order of the correlations is measured, the larger super-resolution can be achieved. That conclusion is based on efficient narrowing of the point-spread function, which, however, does not necessarily imply better resolution as the ability to reconstruct smaller features of the investigated object successfully.",Optical diffraction;Correlation;Optical microscopy;Microscopy;Superresolution;Optical imaging;Optimization,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC52157.2021.9541952
Graph-Theoretic Post-Processing of Segmentation With Application to Dense Biofilms,"Recent deep learning methods have provided successful initial segmentation results for generalized cell segmentation in microscopy. However, for dense arrangements of small cells with limited ground truth for training, the deep learning methods produce both over-segmentation and under-segmentation errors. Post-processing attempts to balance the trade-off between the global goal of cell counting for instance segmentation, and local fidelity to the morphology of identified cells. The need for post-processing is especially evident for segmenting 3D bacterial cells in densely-packed communities called biofilms. A graph-based recursive clustering approach, m-LCuts, is proposed to automatically detect collinearly structured clusters and applied to post-process unsolved cells in 3D bacterial biofilm segmentation. Construction of outlier-removed graphs to extract the collinearity feature in the data adds additional novelty to m-LCuts. The superiority of m-LCuts is observed by the evaluation in cell counting with over 90% of cells correctly identified, while a lower bound of 0.8 in terms of average single-cell segmentation accuracy is maintained. This proposed method does not need manual specification of the number of cells to be segmented. Furthermore, the broad adaptation for working on various applications, with the presence of data collinearity, also makes m-LCuts stand out from the other approaches.",Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Microorganisms;Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Biomedical imaging;Shape;Multi-dimensional;data clustering;graph cut;post-processing;cell segmentation,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2021.3116792

The Optical Subsystem for the Portable Dust Concentration Measuring System,"Air pollution is one of the main threats to human health.

Lane Change Analysis and Prediction Using Mean Impact Value Method and Logistic Regression Model,"The analysis and estimation of lane change (LC) behavior are essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to predict other vehicles' intentions and avoid accidents. Since the LC intention is easily affected by various features, the feature selection and LC modeling greatly influence the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Therefore, a binary logistic regression LC model with a mean impact value (MIV) method to select features is proposed for accurate prediction. First, the related features are classified as individual, microscopic, and macroscopic levels. Then they are ranked and analyzed by the MIV method. Next, the closely related features are selected and used as input to the logistic regression model for LC intention prediction. As a result, a highly interpretable LC model is built with a prediction performance of around 80%. This paper benefits the quantification and explanation of the influences of different levels' features on LC intention and lays a solid foundation for the AVs to predict the LC behavior.",Analytical models;Microscopy;Conferences;Estimation;Predictive models;Solids;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564943

RGB color feature extraction is done by utilizing histogram. Histogram give information about highest frequency of intensity. Data analysis was statistically using grouped frequency distributions to obtain range number of RGB.

Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithm for Classification of different Osteosarcoma types,"Histopathological osteosarcoma data analysis gives a lucrative way to study the pathological texture of Osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is classifying into Viable, Necrotic, and Non-Tumor. A Viable cell indicates a cancerous cell element and a necrotic cell means the cancerous cell nuclei kill by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Necrosis is the process where cell injury results in the death of a cell. Classification of Osteosarcoma is a very time-consuming and complicated task due to its inter-class similarities and variations. Improvement in Machine Learning(ML) algorithm and Graphical Processing Unit(GPU) gives more accurate results for the classification and prediction of Osteosarcoma. In this paper, we use four ML algorithms for the classification of OST: Decision Tree(DT), Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and AdaBoost(Adaptive Boosting). The ML model performance evaluation uses performance metrics like Accuracy, Sensitivity, specificity, F1 -score, Kappa, and AUC (area under the curve). All four classifiers successfully classified Osteosarcoma into three types. The overall accuracy of DT, SVM, KNN and Adboost is 81.22%, 83.80%, 86.90% and 91.70% respectively.

Blood Cells Classification for Identification of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia on Microscopic Images Using Image Processing,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells) that generally occurs in children.

A fractal analysis of the holographic diffraction patterns for detecting microplastics among diatoms,"Water pollution is one of the main global emergencies that must be quickly addressed in order to hinder its growing effects, which represent a danger for the environmental and the human health. It is mostly due to the production of microplastics from the larger plastic items released more and more into the water environment during the last decades. Therefore, the accurate identification of microplastics is strongly requested in order to assess the degree of pollution of a certain water area and then to apply suitable ecological strategies to clean it. However, this goal has not yet been achieved, because of the wide heterogeneity of objects that can be found in a water sample, and their microscopic dimensions. In particular, a lot of species of diatoms (i.e., unicellular microalgae) share the same range size and shape with microplastics. Digital holography (DH) has been exploited to realize a quantitative analysis of the microplastics’ and diatoms’ properties at the microscopic scale. Recently, we demonstrated the fruitful combination between the DH and the fractal geometry, in order to measure a very distinctive fractal signature related to the scattering properties of the imaged samples. Here we demonstrate that, by properly combining some of these fractal parameters with each other, also subsets of the fractal features allow to reach high accuracy in detecting microplastics among diatoms. These results, combined to the flow cytometric applications of DH, could open the route for fast and accurate tools for the microplastics’ identification and quantification in water.",Training;Support vector machines;Microscopy;Sea measurements;Scattering;Tools;Feature extraction;microplastics;water pollution;fractal analysis;digital holography;machine learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 International Workshop on Metrology for the Sea; Learning to Measure Sea Health Parameters (MetroSea),10.1109/MetroSea52177.2021.9611578

Driving-Pattern Identification and Event Detection Based on an Unsupervised Learning Framework: Case of a Motorcycle-Riding Simulator,"Analysis of human driving behavior aims to inspect drivers’ behavior in the real-world and in a virtual environment. The study of driving behaviors can be conducted in naturalistic situations or controlled experiments. Analyzing driving behaviors based on the data collected in naturalistic driving experiments or controlled experiments in the real-world or in a virtual environment is beneficial to fill in many of the knowledge gaps about driving behaviors and risk factors. The amount of data collected during complex experiments with many laps and many drivers tested under different experimental conditions and with different instructions can be huge. Analyzing such data can thus be considered challenging and time-consuming if done manually because it requires calling on experts in traffic psychology to inspect and understand various specific situations at a macroscopic scale involving different riders and at a microscopic scale for a particular rider on a specific lap. Also, it can be challenging in an unsupervised context to detect and match the same patterns in different laps to study similar patterns and spot important and risky events. This paper proposes a multi-step framework for analyzing driving behavior on both the macroscopic and microscopic scales. The core step of this framework is based on unsupervised machine learning algorithms applied to driving-pattern identification and the detection of critical driving events using anomaly-detection algorithms. The detected events are interpreted and described by computing their feature importance using graphs centrality measures. This provides new insight into driving behavior by identifying the motives behind the driver’s actions. The present experimental study, based on a dataset collected from the Honda Riding Trainer (HRT) simulator was conducted in the context of the European project SimuSafe and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. These results argue in favor of the development of such methodologies in driving-behavior studies.",Roads;Vehicles;Feature extraction;Accidents;Automobiles;Tools;Microscopy;Time series analysis;time series segmentation;driving-pattern identification;motorcycle simulator;unsupervised learning;anomaly detection,ARTICLE,2021,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3130400
Photon-Limited Object Detection using Non-local Feature Matching and Knowledge Distillation,"Robust object detection under photon-limited conditions is crucial for applications such as night vision, surveillance, and microscopy, where the number of photons per pixel is low due to a dark environment and/or a short integration time. While the mainstream ""low-light"" image enhancement methods have produced promising results that improve the image contrast between the foreground and background through advanced coloring techniques, the more challenging problem of mitigating the photon shot noise inherited from the random Poisson process remains open. In this paper, we present a photon-limited object detection framework by adding two ideas to state-of-the-art object detectors: 1) a space-time non-local module that leverages the spatial-temporal information across an image sequence in the feature space, and 2) knowledge distillation in the form of student-teacher learning to improve the robustness of the detector’s feature extractor against noise. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines. When integrated with the latest photon counting devices, the algorithm achieves more than 50% mean average precision at a photon level of 1 photon per pixel.",Performance evaluation;Night vision;Surveillance;Microscopy;Object detection;Detectors;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW),10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00443
Lizard: A Large-Scale Dataset for Colonic Nuclear Instance Segmentation and Classification,"The development of deep segmentation models for computational pathology (CPath) can help foster the investigation of interpretable morphological biomarkers. Yet, there is a major bottleneck in the success of such approaches be-cause supervised deep learning models require an abundance of accurately labelled data. This issue is exacerbated in the field of CPath because the generation of detailed annotations usually demands the input of a pathologist to be able to distinguish between different tissue constructs and nuclei. Manually labelling nuclei may not be a feasible approach for collecting large-scale annotated datasets, especially when a single image region can contain thousands of different cells. However, solely relying on automatic generation of annotations will limit the accuracy and reliability of ground truth. Therefore, to help overcome the above challenges, we propose a multi-stage annotation pipeline to enable the collection of large-scale datasets for histology image analysis, with pathologist-in-the-loop refinement steps. Using this pipeline, we generate the largest known nuclear instance segmentation and classification dataset, containing nearly half a million labelled nuclei in H&E stained colon tissue. We have released the dataset and encourage the research community to utilise it to drive forward the development of downstream cell-based models in CPath.",Deep learning;Image segmentation;Image analysis;Annotations;Histopathology;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW),10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00082
Robust Interactive Semantic Segmentation of Pathology Images with Minimal User Input,"From the simple measurement of tissue attributes in pathology workflow to designing an explainable diagnostic/prognostic AI tool, access to accurate semantic segmentation of tissue regions in histology images is a prerequisite. However, delineating different tissue regions manually is a laborious, time-consuming and costly task that requires expert knowledge. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art automatic deep learning models for semantic segmentation require lots of annotated training data and there are only a limited number of tissue region annotated images publicly available. To obviate this issue in computational pathology projects and collect large-scale region annotations efficiently, we propose an efficient interactive segmentation network that requires minimum input from the user to accurately annotate different tissue types in the histology image. The user is only required to draw a simple squiggle inside each region of interest so it will be used as the guiding signal for the model. To deal with the complex appearance and amorph geometry of different tissue regions we introduce several automatic and minimalistic guiding signal generation techniques that help the model to become robust against the variation in the user input. By experimenting on a dataset of breast cancer images, we show that not only does our proposed method speed up the interactive annotation process, it can also outperform the existing automatic and interactive region segmentation models.",Geometry;Deep learning;Image segmentation;Histopathology;Annotations;Computational modeling;Semantics,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW),10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00081
Multiple Myeloma Prediction from Bone-Marrow Blood Cell images using Machine Learning,"Myeloma is a type of blood cancer that affects the plasma cells in the bone marrow, which produces antibodies that help the immune system to fight against outside aggression. Myeloma results in production of abnormal antibodies thereby weaking the function of the immune system. Out of the different types of blood cancers, the proposed research provides a robust mechanism for Multiple Myeloma (MM) prediction using 85 Microscopic blood images that were captured from bone marrow aspiration of patients suffering from the disease. The proposed work eradicates the probability of errors in the manual process of feature extraction by employing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for it and this is followed by training the model with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest algorithms for classification. Along with SVM and Random Forest we used Random Search Optimizer for finding the suitable set of hyper parameters for better results. The overall accuracy was recorded to be 100%, for CNN-ANN model. Thus, the model can be used effectively for determining the Multiple Myeloma from the cell images.",Support vector machines;Cells (biology);Feature extraction;Bones;Data models;Classification algorithms;Convolutional neural networks;MultipleMyeloma;Convolutional Neural Network;Support Vector Machine;Artificial Neural Network;Random Forest;Random Search,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 Emerging Trends in Industry 4.0 (ETI 4.0),10.1109/ETI4.051663.2021.9619385
Tumor-Stroma Classification in Colorectal Cancer Patients with Transfer Learning based Binary Classifier,"Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of the colorectal diseases based on histological images of the cancer tissues have attracted massive interests in digital pathology. In this context, we propose, in this paper, a transfer learning approach for solving binary classification task of the tumor-stroma region of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used with ImageNet dataset as a source dataset, where the features of the bottleneck layer are transferred to the simple classification head. The classification head consists of a global maxpool layer followed by dropout and a single unit dense layer that outputs raw prediction values which are ultimately classified as 0 or 1, each denoting tumor and stroma region respectively. A target dataset containing small number of CRC histological images is used to train the classification head. During inference, the proposed binary classifier accurately classifies the tumor-stroma region and significantly improves the classification accuracy compared to reference schemes.",Pathology;Head;Transfer learning;Generative adversarial networks;Information and communication technology;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;Colorectal Cancer;Deep Learning;Transfer Learning;Image Classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC),10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621053
Computer Vision Approach for the detection of Thrombocytopenia from Microscopic Blood Smear Images,"The counting and analysis of blood cells is the first step in detecting diseases such as COVID-19, dengue, and leukemia. In primary health care centers, platelet counting is usually performed manually from peripheral blood smears, which is labor-intensive and requires an experienced laboratory technician, which invites error. The complete blood count test is carried out using the automatic hematology analyzer with the development of technology. However, this is an expensive method to count the blood cells. This paper introduces an efficient and cost-effective computer vision technique known as blob detection for automatic platelet counting. The technology uses digitized microscopic blood smear images to identify platelets as blobs used to quantify clinically relevant features, i.e., detection of thrombocytopenia, leading to further medical analysis. Detection of thrombocytopenia is imperative as the reduced platelet count may cause small gum bleeds to severe conditions like hemorrhage or even death. The algorithm is developed using a dataset of 50 digitized microscopic blood smear images. The clinically estimated manual platelet count is considered as a reference. The developed algorithm gives an accuracy of about 96.4% for the detection of platelets. The automated count will ensure greater accuracy and allow hematologists to perform faster analysis. This system can be deployed in remote areas as a supporting aid for telemedicine technology.",Blood platelets;Telemedicine;Conferences;Cells (biology);Medical services;Manuals;Feature extraction;peripheral blood smear;computer vision;platelet;thrombocytopenia;blob detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,"2021 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)",10.1109/CONECCT52877.2021.9622688
Modified Reinhard Algorithm for Color Normalization of Colorectal Cancer Histopathology Images,"In recent trends, Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) enables the pathologists to diagnose cancer disease from histopathology images very efficiently. Color normalization is a pre-processing step prior to cancer classification task which can reduce the computational complexity of the classifier. However, existing color normalization methods are fraught with the problems of data loss and huge computational complexity. The purpose of employing this color normalization method is to reduce the color variation among a set of histopathology images so that in the next step, the classifier can efficiently extract the prominent features for cancer grading. This color variation is generally occurred due to using different scanners, stain concentration variability and poor tissue sectioning, while preparing the histopathology slides. In this paper, a modified Reinhard algorithm is proposed for color normalization of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained colorectal cancer histopathology images. The limitations of Reinhard algorithm are alleviated by the proposed algorithm. Moreover, a statistical analysis is provided to prove that proposed algorithm does not cause any data loss and subsequently, it satisfies all four hypotheses of color normalization. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with other existing color normalization methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",Image color analysis;Histopathology;Statistical analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Color Normalization;Computer Assisted Diagnosis;H&E stained histopathology images;colorectal cancer;image processing;contrast enhancement;correlation coefficient,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO),10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616117
An interpretable machine learning model to explain the interplay between brain lesions and cortical atrophy in multiple sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause, (after trauma) of neurological disability in young adults in Western countries. While several Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated a strong association between the presence of cortical grey matter atrophy and the progression of neurological impairment in MS patients, the neurobiological substrates of cortical atrophy in MS, and in particular its relationship with white matter (WM) and cortical lesions, remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between cortical atrophy and different types of lesions at Ultra-High Field (UHF) 7 T MRI, including cortical lesions and lesions with a susceptibility rim (a feature which histopathological studies have associated with impaired remyelination and progressive tissue destruction). We combined lesion characterization with a recent machine learning (ML) framework which includes explainability, and we were able to predict cortical atrophy in MS from a handful of lesion-related features extracted from 7 T MR imaging. This highlights not only the importance of UHF MRI for accurately evaluating intracortical and rim lesion load, but also the differential contributions that these types of lesions may bring to determine disease evolution and severity. Also, we found that a small subset of features [WM lesion volume (not considering rim lesions), patient age and WM lesion count (not considering rim lesions), intracortical lesion volume] carried most of the prediction power. Interestingly, an almost opposite pattern emerged when contrasting cortical with WM lesion load: WM lesion load is most important when it is small, whereas cortical lesion load behaves in the opposite way.Clinical Relevance— Our results suggest that disconnection and axonal degeneration due to WM lesions and local cortical demyelination are the main factors determining cortical thinning. These findings further elucidate the complexity of MS pathology across the whole brain and the need for both statistical and mechanistic approaches to understanding the etiopathogenesis of lesions.",Atrophy;Pathology;Multiple sclerosis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Grey matter;Machine learning;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629526
Contrastive Learning for Mitochondria Segmentation,"Mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy images is essential in neuroscience. However, due to the image degradation during the imaging process, the large variety of mitochondrial structures, as well as the presence of noise, artifacts and other sub-cellular structures, mitochondria segmentation is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective contrastive learning framework to learn a better feature representation from hard examples to improve segmentation. Specifically, we adopt a point sampling strategy to pick out representative pixels from hard examples in the training phase. Based on these sampled pixels, we introduce a pixel-wise label-based contrastive loss which consists of a similarity loss term and a consistency loss term. The similarity term can increase the similarity of pixels from the same class and the separability of pixels from different classes in feature space, while the consistency term is able to enhance the sensitivity of the 3D model to changes in image content from frame to frame. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MitoEM dataset as well as FIB-SEM dataset and show better or on par with state-of-the-art results.",Training;Degradation;Image segmentation;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Sensitivity;Neuroscience;Electron Microscopy;Mitochondria;Image Segmentation;Contrastive Learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630350
Visualization and quantitative analyses for mouse embryonic stem cell tracking by manipulating hierarchical data structures using time-lapse confocal microscopy images,"We present a cell tracking method for time-lapse confocal microscopy (3D) images that uses dynamic hierarchical data structures to assist cell and colony segmentation and tracking. During the segmentation, the cell and colony numbers and their geometric data are recorded for each 3D image set. In tracking, the colony correspondences between neighboring frames of time-lapse 3D images are first computed using the recorded colony centers. Then, cell correspondences in the correspondent colonies are computed using the recorded cell centers. The examples show the proposed cell tracking method can achieve high tracking accuracy for time-lapse 3D images of undifferentiated but self-renewing mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells where the number and mobility of ES cells in a cell colony may change suddenly by a colony merging or splitting, and cell proliferation or death. The geometric data in the hierarchical data structures also help the visualization and quantitation of the cell shapes and mobility.",Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Statistical analysis;Shape;Microscopy;Merging;Data visualization,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629490
Dual Encoder Attention U-net for Nuclei Segmentation,"Nuclei segmentation in whole slide images (WSIs) stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) dye, is a key step in computational pathology which aims to automate the laborious process of manual counting and segmentation. Nuclei segmentation is a challenging problem that involves challenges such as touching nuclei resolution, small-sized nuclei, size, and shape variations. With the advent of deep learning, convolution neural networks (CNNs) have shown a powerful ability to extract effective representations from microscopic H&E images. We propose a novel dual encoder Attention U-net (DEAU) deep learning architecture and pseudo hard attention gating mechanism, to enhance the attention to target instances. We added a new secondary encoder to the attention U-net to capture the best attention for a given input. Since H captures nuclei information, we propose a stain-separated H channel as input to the secondary encoder. The role of the secondary encoder is to transform attention prior to different spatial resolutions while learning significant attention information. The proposed DEAU performance was evaluated on three publicly available H&E data sets for nuclei segmentation from different research groups. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other attention-based approaches for nuclei segmentation.",Deep learning;Measurement;Image segmentation;Visualization;Pathology;Shape;Microscopy;Dual Encoder;Nuclei segmentation;Attention,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630037
An Interpretable Approach for Lung Cancer Prediction and Subtype Classification using Gene Expression,"Lung cancer is the deadliest form of cancer, accounting for 20% of total cancer deaths. It represents a group of histologically and molecularly heterogeneous diseases even within the same histological subtype. Moreover, accurate histological subtype diagnosis influences the specific subtype’s target genes, which will help define the treatment plan to target those genes in therapy. Deep learning (DL) models seem to set the benchmarks for the tasks of cancer prediction and subtype classification when using gene expression data; however, these methods do not provide interpretability, which is great concern from the perspective of cancer biology since the identification of the cancer driver genes in an individual provides essential information for treatment and prognosis. In this work, we identify some limitations of previous work that showed efforts to build algorithms to extract feature weights from DL models, and we propose using tree-based learning algorithms that address these limitations. Preliminary results show that our methods outperform those of related research while providing model interpretability.Clinical Relevance: The machine learning methods used in this work are interpretable and provide biological insight. Two sets of genes were extracted: a set that differentiates normal tissue from cancerous tissue (cancer prediction), and a set of genes that distinguishes LUAD from LUSC samples (subtype classification).",Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Biological system modeling;Lung cancer;Medical treatment;Predictive models;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630775
Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification with Adversarial Image Synthesis,"Data limitation is one of the major challenges in applying deep learning to medical images. Data augmentation is a critical step to train robust and accurate deep learning models for medical images. In this research, we increase the size of a small dataset by using an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) which generates realistic images along with their class labels.We evaluate the effectiveness of our ACGAN augmentation method by performing breast cancer histopathological image classification with deep convolutional neural network (dCNN) classifiers trained on our enhanced dataset. For our classifier, we use a transfer learning approach where the convolutional features are extracted from a pertained model and subsequently fed into several extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifiers. Our experimental results on Breast Cancer Histopathological (BreakHis) dataset show that ACGAN data augmentation, along with our XGBoost classifier increases the classification accuracy by 9.35% for binary classification (benign vs. malignant) and 8.88% for four-class tumor sub-type classification compared with standard transfer learning approach.",Deep learning;Image synthesis;Transfer learning;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Standards;Image classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630678
Antral Variation of Murine Gastric Pacemaker Cells Informed by Confocal Imaging and Machine Learning Methods,"The Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICC) are specialized gastrointestinal (GI) pacemaker cells that generate and actively propagate electrophysiological events called slow waves. Slow waves regulate the GI motility necessary for digestion. Several functional GI motility disorders have been associated with depletion in the ICC. In this study, a validated Fast Random Forest (FRF) classification method using Trainable WEKA Segmentation for segmenting the networks of ICC was applied to confocal microscopy images of a whole mount tissue from the distal antrum of a mouse stomach (583 × 3,376 × 133 μm3, parcellated into 24 equal image stacks). The FRF model performance was compared to 6 manually segmented subflelds and produced an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.95. Structural variations of ICC network in the longitudinal muscle (ICC-LM) and myenteric plexus (ICC-MP) were quantified. The average volume of ICC-MP was significantly higher than ICC-LM at any point throughout the antral tissue sampled. There was a pronounced decline of up to 80% in ICC-LM (from 3,705 μm3 to 716 μm3) over a distance of 279.3 μm, that eventually diminished towards the distal antrum. However, an inverse relationship was observed in ICC-MP with an overall increase of up to 157% (from 59,100 μm3 to 151,830 μm3) over a distance of approximately 2 mm that proceeds towards the distal antrum.",Image segmentation;Stomach;Microscopy;Pacemakers;Muscles;Mice;Gastrointestinal tract,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630341
Nuclei Segmentation on Histopathology Images of Breast Carcinoma,"With the use of computer-aided diagnostic systems, the automatic detection and segmentation of the cell nuclei have become essential in pathology due to cellular nuclei counting and nuclear pleomorphism analysis are critical for the classification and grading of breast cancer histopathology. This work describes a methodology for automatic detection and segmentation of cellular nuclei in breast cancer histopathology images obtained from the BreakHis database, the Standford tissue microarray database, and the Breast Cancer Cell Segmentation database. The proposed scheme is based on the characterization of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, size, and shape features. In addition, we use the information obtained from morphological transformations and adaptive intensity adjustments to detect and separate each cell nucleus detected in the image. The segmentation was carried out by testing the proposed methodology in a histological breast cancer database that provides the associated groundtruth segmentation. Subsequently, the Sørensen-Dice similarity coefficient was calculated to analyze the suitability of the results.Clinical relevance— In this work, the detection and segmentation of cell nuclei in breast cancer histological images are carried out automatically. The method can identify cell nuclei regardless of variations in the level of staining and image magnification. Moreover, a granulometric analysis of the components allows identifying cell clumps and segment them into individual cell nuclei. Improved identification of cell nuclei under different image conditions was demonstrated to reach a sensitivity average of 0.76 ± 0.12. The results provide a base for further and complex processes such as cell counting, feature analysis, and nuclear pleomorphism, which are relevant tasks in the evaluation and diagnostic performed by the expert pathologist.",Image segmentation;Sensitivity;Databases;Histopathology;Shape;Breast cancer;Robustness,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630846
Classification of Histopathological Images by Spatial Feature Extraction and Morphological Methods,"The high accuracy of the computerized analysis of histopathological images is very important in the detection of cancerous cells. Thanks to the images with high accuracy, early diagnosis will be made with the detection of cancerous cells. Four different types (benign, normal, in situ carcinoma, invasive carcinoma) classification performances will be analyzed by applying various methods to cancer cells. At the beginning of the studies, the BACH data set was obtained, then the desired and usable parts were tried to be extracted with image processing methods. After obtaining data and images of different sizes, their features were extracted with different algorithms (HOG, GLCM, EMP, SIFT, SURF, LBP), and then the accuracy of classifications was examined with RF, KNN, SVM machine learning algorithms and transfer learning algorithm ResNet.",Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Machine learning algorithms;Filtering;Transfer learning;Filtering algorithms;Feature extraction;Histopathological images;classification;spatial feature extraction;morphological feature extraction;ResNet,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 Medical Technologies Congress (TIPTEKNO),10.1109/TIPTEKNO53239.2021.9632899
PiPo-Net: A Semi-automatic and Polygon-based Annotation Method for Pathological Images,"Metastatic involvement of lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic variables for many cancers. Several deep learning based algorithms have been developed to segment metastatic regions in pathological images to help predict prognosis. However, the training of these methods requires a large amount of annotated data, and the labeling task is an extremely time-consuming process for human annotators. In order to reduce the annotation burden, we for the first time propose a semi-automatic annotation method (PiPo-Net) for the labeling of pathological images. The method is comprised of two subnetworks, a pixel-wise segmentation network (Pi-Net) and a polygon-based annotation network (Po-Net). The Pi-Net adopts an improved encoder-decoder architecture and can effectively aggregate multi-scale image features. The Po-Net is built on the Pi-Net and leverages a two-layer recurrent neural network to generate tight-bounded polygons for the metastatic regions. Corresponding to the proposed network architecture, a loss function called PiPo-loss is introduced to help optimize the whole network. The main advantage of our method is that it integrates human annotators into the prediction loop, allowing to iteratively refine the predictions according to the suggestions from human annotators. We evaluate our method on Camelyon16 database and achieve a Dice score of 91% in the initial annotation attempt. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the human-network collaborative annotation, which achieves promising labeling results, verifying the advantages of our proposed method.",Training;Pathology;Image segmentation;Annotations;Aggregates;Semantics;Collaboration,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636146
Microscopy Mineral Image Enhancement Using Multiscale Top-Hat Transform,"The acquisition of microscopic images of minerals with good contrast is critical for the identification and analysis of their properties. However, in many cases, the microscopic images of minerals obtained are unclear due to the image environment, imperfect adjustment of the microscopy operators or improper collection of samples. In this paper, we present an algorithm to enhance the microscopic images of minerals by multiscale Top-Hat transform using contrast adjustment weights. First, the multiple dark and bright features of the mineral image are extracted using the top-hat transform. Secondly, bright scale differences and dark scale differences obtained in the previous step are calculated. Third, all the intensities of the multiple dark and bright features from the previous steps are summed separately. Finally, the bright features adjusted for a contrast weight are then added to the image and dark features adjusted for the same weight are subtracted from the image.

Increasing Performance of Plasmodium Detection Using Bottom-Hat and Adaptive Thresholding,"Based on WHO data, in 2019 there were around 229 million cases of malaria worldwide, with a death rate of 409,000 people. This disease can be cured if diagnosis is done accurately and quickly. The gold standard for malaria diagnosis is microscopic examination. Despite the huge number of microscopic examinations, there are still some misdiagnose caused by human error. The previous research has developed a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) method for identify the phase of Plasmodium Falciparum. However, the study focused only on thin blood smear, meanwhile in cases of thick blood smear, a better technique is needed because plasmodium in thick blood smear is not well visualized and very small. The purpose of this research is to develop detection method based on digital image processing to support the malaria detection by paramedics. The result of this research will be able to differentiate Plasmodium parasites and artifacts. The data used is a digital microscopic image of thick blood smear. Data acquisition was held in Laboratory of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Gadjah Mada. 846 objects are obtained from 38 image in a time. There are nine features of the texture. The features are then selected by the Wrapper, CFS and the Gain Ratio feature selection method.

Data-Driven Ischemic Stroke Clot Phenotyping from Whole-Slide Histopathology Images,"Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a predominant treatment modality for acute ischemic stroke. In vitro MT experiments are critical for testing the efficacy of thrombectomy devices, and are traditionally performed on artificial clots fabricated from animal blood. These clots are generally categorized as red blood cell (RBC)-rich or fibrin-platelet aggregate (FP)-rich. Although clinical studies have shown that clots are more complex in structure, with implications for device testing, clot histological architecture has not been quantified. We hypothesized that computational image analysis can be used to quantify clot structure and compute more informative phenotypes defined by diversity in histological patterns rather than percent composition. Brightfield whole-slide images (WSIs) of H&E stained clots from n=68 patients were acquired. Digital image processing techniques were applied to compartmentalize (segment) clot WSIs into RBC-FP regions as well as engineer 204 image features (textural and geometric) from RBC and FP compartments. Unsupervised learning was used to identify five computational clot phenotypes from engineered features. While three phenotypes were distinguishable based on composition alone – RBC-rich, FP-rich, and FP-rich with small RBC regions—two “mixed” phenotypes required more intensive analysis of computed features. More specifically, phenotypes 3 and 5 were distinguishable based on the regional distribution of RBCs and FP—larger, focal RBC regions were observed in cluster 3, whereas smaller, diffuse RBC regions amidst contiguous FP regions were observed in cluster 5. These observations were corroborated by quantitative analyses performed on the features. Quantification of diverse histological patterns in digital clot pathology paves the way for future research investigating how clots of different phenotypes are related to procedural and cognitive outcomes, and how they can be mimicked in in vitro MT testbeds.",Performance evaluation;Image segmentation;Image analysis;Histopathology;Statistical analysis;Red blood cells;Signal processing;Acute ischemic stroke;clot phenotypes;computational histology;computational phenotyping;mechanical thrombectomy,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE Western New York Image and Signal Processing Workshop (WNYISPW),10.1109/WNYISPW53194.2021.9661288
Automatic Preprocessing and Ensemble Learning for Cell Segmentation with Low Quality,"We propose an automatic preprocessing and ensemble learning for segmentation of cell images with low quality. It is difficult to capture cells with strong light. Therefore, the microscopic images of cells tend to have low image quality but these images are not good for semantic segmentation. Here we propose a method to translate an input image to the images that are easy to recognize by deep learning. The proposed method consists of two deep neural networks. The first network is the usual training for semantic segmentation, and penultimate feature maps of the first network are used as filters to translate an input image to the images that emphasize each class. This is the automatic preprocessing and translated cell images are easily classified. The input cell image with low quality is translated by the feature maps in the first network, and the translated images are fed into the second network for semantic segmentation. Since the outputs of the second network are multiple segmentation results, we conduct the weighted ensemble of those segmentation images. Two networks are trained by end-to-end manner, and we do not need to prepare images with high quality for the translation. We confirmed that our proposed method can translate cell images with low quality to the images that are easy to segment, and segmentation accuracy has improved using the weighted ensemble learning.",Deep learning;Training;Image quality;Image segmentation;Image recognition;Microscopy;Semantics,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,"2021 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)",10.1109/SMC52423.2021.9658801
Instrumentation Evaluation for Hyperspectral Microscopy Targeting Enhanced Medical Histology,"Hyperspectral (HS) imaging is a novel technique that allows a better understanding of materials, being an improvement respect to other imaging modalities in multiple applications. The selection of the appropriate HS sensor technology for certain applications is a crucial first step since different sensor types provide different characteristics. In this work, the evaluation of two different HS sensors coupled to an optical microscope was performed targeting medical histology applications. First, two illumination systems were characterized, since optimal illumination is needed for proper sample visualization. Afterwards, different parameters, such as magnification, spatial and spectral resolution, and acquisition time, were measured for both HS sensors. Moreover, breast cancer histological samples from a postoperative analysis were captured to evaluate the performance of each sensor in the targeted application. The main results show that the spatial-spectral scanning sensor allows capturing data in higher magnifications (up to 50×) using the standard illumination from the microscope, while spatial scanning sensor only reach a maximum magnification of 20×. However, the spectral information provided by the spatial scanning sensor is more accurate than the spatial-spectral scanning sensor. Hence, there is a tradeoff between both technologies depending on the final application to be studied.",Optical fibers;Optical microscopy;Histopathology;Microscopy;Lighting;Cameras;Time measurement;hyperspectral imaging (HSI);medical imaging;pushbroom camera;snapscan camera;hyperspectral microscopy;histology,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 XXXVI Conference on Design of Circuits and Integrated Systems (DCIS),10.1109/DCIS53048.2021.9666188
ISE-YOLO: Improved Squeeze-and-Excitation Attention Module based YOLO for Blood Cells Detection,"Accurate detection of human peripheral blood cells is of great significance to assist doctors to diagnose blood-related diseases. Traditional clinical detection of peripheral blood cells is usually identified by manual microscopy. However, such artificial analysis and processing methods are easily affected by subjective factors, which will cause certain errors. In recent years, the convolutional neural network has been applied to various medical image processing tasks and has shown satisfactory performance. However, traditional CNNs are limited by the lack of feature expression ability. This work introduces the idea of visual attention mechanism into the deep learning detection model and design an improved Squeeze-and-Excitation based YOLO-v3 detection model (ISE-YOLO). This model adds our improved SE module into the different structural blocks of the YOLO to strengthen the network information discrimination of input features and improve the detection performance.

Cell Nuclei and Lipid Droplets Quantification in Stimulated Raman Images,"Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a stain-free, laser-scanning imaging technology that allows for rapid chemical imaging at high-resolution. When developing cancer diagnosis based on cellular and tissue pathology, it is critical to understand the number, size, and density of the cell nuclei, as well as other metabolic features, such as the lipid droplets. In our research, we compare the U-Net and Mask R-CNN convolutional neural network architectures to segment cell nuclei from SRS images of cultured cancer cells. We also use a modified version of U-Net to identify the centroids of nuclei and lipid droplets. Combining these centroids with a segmentation, we can generate a Voronoi diagram to estimate the size of each nucleus and lipid droplet. Future work will focus on applying these methods to identify and segment various cellular structure in both cells and human cancer tissues with SRS imaging.",Image segmentation;Pathology;Microprocessors;Microscopy;Raman scattering;Computer architecture;Big Data,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671369
A Personalized Diagnostic Generation Framework Based on Multi-source Heterogeneous Data,"Personalized diagnoses have not been possible due to a sear amount of data pathologists have to bear during the day-to-day routine, leading to the current generalized standards being continuously updated as new findings are reported. It is noticeable that these practical standards are developed based on multi-source heterogeneous data, including whole-slide images and pathology and clinical reports. In this study, we propose a framework that combines pathological images and medical reports to generate a personalized diagnosis result for an individual patient. We use nuclei-level image feature similarity and content-based deep learning method to search for a personalized group of populations with similar pathological characteristics, extract structured prognostic information from descriptive pathology reports of the similar patient population, and assign importance of different prognostic factors to generate a personalized pathological diagnosis result.

Cluster Image Patches with Multiple Mutual Information in Unlabelled Whole-Slide Image,"The massive annotation workload has always hindered the progress towards an automatic analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images. Histologically, individual patches from a constrained spatial region may share rich phenotypic information, where the morphological correlations have the potential to be mined for a grouping or clustering task. In this paper, we propose a clustering technique to extract multiple mutual information from histology images without prior domain knowledge. Specifically, our framework automatically localizes morphologically homogeneous patches within an extended solution space. Our novelty is an expanse and the pattern with which invariant information can be learnt, in contrast to the current literature of feature generation or parametric transformation within an individual patch. Additionally, structure-independent, the model may be applicable to any backbone convolutional neural network architectures. The empirical validation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets illustrates an observable margin of patch-level classification accuracy in comparison with state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches.",Histopathology;Microscopy;Supervised learning;Genomics;Feature extraction;Bioinformatics;Task analysis;Histopathology;Unsupervised learning;Clustering;Multiple mutual information,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669810
A rare case of intracystic Her-2 positive young breast cancer,"Intracystic breast cancer is a rare and poorly understood type of breast cancer which differs from other types of breast cancer in both clinical and histopathological characteristics. We herein describe a rare case of a 34-year-old patient with intracystic breast cancer. Imaging of ultrasonography and histopathological findings are critical for diagnosis and the optimal treatment choice. With diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma with Her-2 positive subtype, patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and anti-Her-2 targeted therapy. After treatment, patient received a right sided modified radical mastectomy. It is necessary to acquire rationally the definitive diagnosis of intracystic breast cancer and carefully determine the regimen of treatment based on results of imaging and pathology.",Pathology;Chemotherapy;Conferences;Imaging;Ultrasonography;Breast cancer;Bioinformatics;Intracystic;breast;cancer;Her-2 positive;invasive,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669897
Boosting Boundary Representation for Gland Instance Segmentation,"Accurate and automated gland instance segmentation on histology images can assist pathologists to analyze the malignancy degree of adenocarcinoma. Recently, deep-learning-based segmentation networks have been significantly developed to achieve this goal. However, the gland instances are generally proximate to each other and have indiscernible boundaries (i.e., homogeneous intensity values). Most of the existed networks do not define discriminative boundaries representation as context information, resulting in segmenting proximate instances incorrectly. In this paper, to improve the segmentation accuracy between proximate instances, we propose a Boundary Definition Module to boost boundaries feature representation by the guidance of the intra-and-extra glandular features. Moreover, we propose to use the Gumbel-Softmax distribution estimator to clarify the final prediction of boundaries further. Finally, we embed the Boundary Definition Module and Gumbel-Softmax distribution estimator into the gland instance network(FullNet) for performance verification. Experiments on the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",Image segmentation;Histopathology;Conferences;Glands;Boosting;Bioinformatics;Gland instance segmentation;Boundary Representation;Deep learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669516
A Contrastive Learning-based PPC-UNet for Colorectal Histopathology Whole Slide Image Segmentation,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and is usually diagnosed using colonoscopy and biopsy. Diagnosis of pathological biopsy requires professional knowledge and technology. Computer-aided gland and lesion segmentation systems have been proposed to help pathologists in diagnosis of CRC. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a literature work trying to segment different levels of intraepithelial neoplasia in CRC pathological image. To reduce such a research gap, in this paper, we firstly collect a colorectal cancer biopsy histopathology whole slide image (WSI) dataset, named Histo-CRC Biopsy dataset, for algorithm evaluation. We further propose a PPC-UNet network to segment high level, low level intraepithelial neoplasia and normal tissues. The proposed PPC-UNet consists of two modules i.e., a UNet-based network for segmentation, and a pixel-to-propagation consistency (PPC) contrastive learning-based network for UNet encoder pre-training. As the important feature can be learned from the unannotated data during pre-training, our approach can consistently improve the Dice of UNet by around 2% when different ratios of the training data are labeled.",Image segmentation;Histopathology;Conferences;Biopsy;Training data;Glands;Colonoscopy;Contrastive learning;whole slide image segmentation;colorectal cancer;deep learning;medical image,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669780
Discriminative Multi-feature Representation for Renal Cancer Detection based on Histopathology Images,"Renal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, and early diagnosis can increase the possibility of successful treatment and survival rate. However, manual detection is time-consuming and relies heavily on the experience of pathologists. Therefore, it is desirable to employ a computer-aided approach to automate the diagnostic process thereby saving time and labor. To date, a substantial amount of research with common deep learning methods have been applied to address this issue. However, deep learning methods require large numbers of images to train the model. Alternatively, traditional machine learning methods such as texture feature extractors can reach a reasonable result with a smaller computing cost. In this paper, we extensively study the efficiency of texture features extracted from histopathology images at detecting kidney cancer by adopting a weighted fusion method of HOG and GLCM, which includes both local structural features and full texture information from the histopathology images. We applied the proposed method on a histopathology image data set containing 93 patients with renal cancer and 150 patients with normal kidneys. The experimental results indicate that our method can achieve a similar outcome to deep learning methods, while reducing the computing time.",Deep learning;Support vector machines;Costs;Histopathology;Hospitals;Manuals;Feature extraction;renal cancer;histopathology images;texture feature;future fusion,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 7th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),10.1109/ICCC54389.2021.9674381
Leukocytes Segmentation and Classification in Digital Microscopic Images,"Image processing and machine learning have recently gained positive contributions to various medical procedures. One of the diagnostic processes&#x0027; essential requirements in many diseases is laboratory tests, such as the Complete Blood Count (CBC) test. In CBC, various leukocytes, also known as White Blood Cells (WBC), are segmented, classified, and counted by a lab technician in microscopic slides. This process is very tiresome and requires a human technician with specialized skill sets. This research proposes a fully automatic algorithm for the segmentation and classification of white blood cells. The proposed method applies pre-processing techniques to digital microscopic images. White blood cells are then segmented based on color pallets. Hybrid features are extracted from the segmented images based on the fusion of local binary patterns and statistical features. Then various classifiers are used for the classification of WBC. Results suggest that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) outclass other classifiers. It was observed that the proposed methodology outperformed existing methods in terms of classification accuracy (97.5&#x0025;).",White blood cells;Support vector machines;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Microscopy;Artificial neural networks;Cells (biology);White Blood Cells Classification;Leukocytes Classification;White Blood Cells Segmentation;Leukocytes Segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 4th International Conference on Computing & Information Sciences (ICCIS),10.1109/ICCIS54243.2021.9676191

Osteosarcoma Classification using Multilevel Feature Fusion and Ensembles,"Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer found in adolescents. Identifying the type of tumour from the histopathological images is a difficult task for the pathologist. In this work, a deep learning based osteosarcoma classification algorithm using ensemble approach and fusion approach is proposed. Multilevel features are extracted from a pre-trained EfficientNets trained on imagenet1k dataset. EfficientNets are scaled convolutional neural networks. This scaling is done in depth, resolution and width. Features are extracted from the initial layers, intermediate layers and final layers of a selected EfficientNet. In general, they represent the low frequency, middle and high frequency details of the images. Independently, the features are given to an error control output coding classifier with support vector machine as base learner. Ensemble prediction is done on the test images by using majority voting from the models trained using features extracted at various levels from EfficientNet. Further, a fused feature vector is formulated from the selected layers of EfficientNets and given to the error control coding output classifier. The proposed algorithm with ensemble approach and fusion approach offers higher mean and peak classification accuracy compared to the existing works in the literature.",Support vector machines;Image resolution;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Encoding;Classification algorithms;Osteosarcoma;Histopathological image classification;EfficientNet;ECOC classifier,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 IEEE 18th India Council International Conference (INDICON),10.1109/INDICON52576.2021.9691543
Analysis of Pixel Intensity Variation by Performing Morphological Operations for Image Segmentation On Cervical Cancer Pap Smear Image,"Cervical cancer is the second largely hazardous metastatic tumor that develops in a woman&#x2019;s cervix. If it is detected at the premature stage and treated correctly then there can be less mortality ratio rate due to cervical cancer .In preliminary stage Pap smear is the simple scrutiny test generally used for the revealing of cancer. For precise screening and detection, cervical cancer is categorized as normal and abnormal cancer which includes the cell and cytoplasm in the identical structure. It is complicated task to distinguish a cancerous nucleus in the cell. Medical image processing is mainly significant but time consuming and complicated task. Medical Image preprocessing of cervical cancer pap smear images and its scrutiny is act of investigating images for recognizing objects and evaluating their impact. The primary reason of Image processing is for discovering of various kinds of unnecessary cells and exposing the amount it spreads. So for the precise segmentation of cervical cells in Pap smear image becomes an essential job to automatically identify the precancerous transforms in the cervix. Image segmentation basically refers to method of division of the image into several segments for tracing objects and borders in image. Various Image processing and segmentation algorithms are utilized to section the nucleus alone in microscopic images.The primary scope of this paper is to spotlight on how the morphological operations on cervical cancer pap smear images is achieved to fine-tune to appropriate pixel concentration and proper contrast for sorting out the tumor piece from an image. In the addressed proposed work morphological operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing are executed and implemented with the aid of structuring element entitled as kernel.

Nuclei Instance Segmentation and Classification in Histopathological Images using a DT-Yolact,"Nuclei instance segmentation and classification in histology images is a challenging task, which requires not only a precise semantic segmentation at pixel-level but also an accurate classification at instance-level. To tackle the problem, in this paper, we propose a Double-Tower Yolact network named DT-Yolact, which introduces a bottom-up path augmentation (BPA) module to pair with the feature pyramid network (FPN) module in Yolact, with the purpose of shortening the transmission path and fuse the lower-level and higher-level features extracted from nuclei. Moreover, a dilated convolution (DC) algorithm is employed in the convolutional neural network to expand the convolution receptive field and further improve the accuracy of prediction. The comparison results on PanNuke histology images have shown that: the mAP of the proposed DT-Yolact network is 3.56% and 1.33% higher than those of the state-of-art Mask R-CNN and the original Yolact networks. Therefore, it is promising to apply the proposed DT-Yolact network to the simultaneous nuclei instance segmentation and classification in histopathological medical images.",Image segmentation;Convolution;Histopathology;Fuses;Semantics;Feature extraction;Ubiquitous computing;Instance segmentaton;Classification;Feature of the fusion;Dilatided convolution,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 20th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications (IUCC/CIT/DSCI/SmartCNS),10.1109/IUCC-CIT-DSCI-SmartCNS55181.2021.00072
Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer Based on Improved AlexNet,"Prostate cancer is a common malignant tumor in male genitourinary system, its morbidity is increasing in recent years. Puncture pathological examination with Gleason scoring is the ultimate means of diagnosing prostate cancer. Early detection of prostate cancer is obviously very important for the treatment and prognosis of the cancer. However, the pathological image of prostate cancer has a complicated texture structure, especially the difference between Gleason Grade 3 and Gleason Grade 4. Therefore, pathological images with a Gleason score of 7 are difficult to distinguish between ""3+4"" and ""4+3"". The misjudgment of ""3+4"" and ""4+3"" impact on quality of life in patients with prostate cancer after operation can be profound. In order to improve the classification accuracy of histopathological images of prostate cancer especially for detecting ""3+4"" and ""4+3"", this paper proposed an image classification model based on improved AlexNet. On the basis of ALexNet, Res1_block and Res2_block structures are added to extract the features of pathological images.

Colon Cancer Classification of Histopathological Images Using Data Augmentation,"Classification of colon cancer has great importance in medical diagnosis. An accurate and real-time investigation provides medical experts to review typical treatment timely. Histopathological inspection is a commonly used method to diagnose colon cancer. Presently, diagnosis methods depend on self-made features which take a long inspection period and require an expert medical professional. This paper proposes four convolutional neural network (CNN), namely, baseline CNN, two-block CNN, three-block CNN, and three-block CNN with data augmentation respectively, to classify colon tissue histopatho-logical images. The purpose of data augmentation is to check the efficacy of the proposed network compared to other existing methods. The histopathological images are given as input to four CNN. Three-block CNN with data augmentation achieved an accuracy of 99.40% shows that the proposed approach outper-forms other existing methods.

Recognition of Feline Epidermal Disease using Raspberry-Pi based Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and Support Vector Machine,"As of 2018, with over 373 million population of cats worldwide, cases of feline skin diseases have drastically increased as well, with 6-15% of feline patients who have experienced at least one form of dermatopathy in their lifetimes. Research on detecting feline skin diseases has been focused on using different diagnostic methods in the past. Examples of these methods include the Fur Pluck Method, which uses microscopic hair evaluation to detect parasites. Another study uses Wood’s Lamp method that uses a UV light source to detect dermatophytosis. In this study, the image processing technique in diagnosing two types of skin diseases, Dermatophytosis and Ectoparasitic Skin Disease, was identified using GLCM and SVM to extract the features and classify the images, respectively. The system trained 270 images with 90 photos each on Dermatophytosis, Ectoparasitic, and unknown skin diseases and tested 45 skin disease images. These feline skin disease images used are primarily from Philippine short-haired cats or Puspins. These feline skin disease images used are primarily from domestic short-haired cats.

Organic Semiconducting Probes for Super-resolution Imaging and In Vivo Imaging,"In this presentation, I will present several new types of polymer dots (Pdot) for optical imaging. The hydrophobic semiconductor polymers tend to form small, stable and densely-packed Pdots. The large absorption cross section, high fluorescence quantum yields, and good biocompatibility are promising for biological imaging in vitro and in vivo. We showed that the small photoblinking Pdots are able to image subcellular structures that breaks the optical diffraction limit. We further report two types of BODIPY-based polymer dots (Pdots) with narrow-band emission, pronounced fluctuations, and prominent photostability, thus enabling high-order, dual color SOFI nanoscopy. Single-particle and subcellular SOFI analysis reveals the superior performance of the BODIPY Pdots as compared to conventional Alexa dye labeled antibodies. In contrast with wide-field images, the spatial resolution (∼57 nm) is enhanced by ∼6.0-fold in 8th-order single-particle SOFI nanoscopy. A final spatial resolution (∼30 nm) was obtained by using multifunctional Pdots, high-order SOFI analysis, together with expansion microscopy. For in vivo imaging, we show that an ultrasensitive optical transducer can be used for wireless glucose monitoring via a smartphone. The optical transducer combines oxygen-sensitive polymer dots (Pdots) with glucose oxidase that sensitively detect glucose when oxygen is consumed in the glucose oxidation reaction. By judicious design of the Pdots with ultralong phosphorescence lifetime, the transducer exhibited a significantly enhanced sensitivity by one order of magnitude as compared to the one in a previous study. As a result, the optical images of subcutaneous glucose level obtained with the smartphone camera could be utilized to clearly distinguish between euglycemia and hyperglycemia. We finally describe NIR-II fluorescent Pdots for high contrast in vivo brain vascular imaging. By performing through-skull and through-scalp imaging of the brain vasculature of live mice, we quantitatively analyzed the vascular morphology of transgenic brain tumors in terms of the vessel lengths, vessel branches, and vessel symmetry, which showed statistically significant differences from the wild type animals. The bright NIR-II Pdots obtained through fluorination chemistry provide insightful information for precise diagnosis of the malignancy of the brain tumor.",In vivo;Optical diffraction;Transducers;Biomedical optical imaging;Imaging;Optical imaging;Glucose,INPROCEEDINGS,2021,2021 Asia Communications and Photonics Conference (ACP),
Understanding the multiclass classification of lymphomas from simple descriptors,"The Lymphoma treatment can be more effective when its type is correctly diagnosed. Several researches have focused on developing accurate classification of the disease from histological images. However, they often use complex features and black box models, making them difficult for specialists to understand. In this work, we use morphological and non-morphological descriptors extracted from cell nuclei for multi-class classification of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Research on Ship Overtaking Behavior and Prediction Method Based on AIS Data,"Ship overtaking behavior is an important component of inland river ships’ behavior. It's necessary to extract the overtaking behavior data, mine the features of inland ships’ overtaking behavior and predict the overtaking behavior model, which will be helpful for risk warning in inland water traffic on real time and is also an essential work of microscopic traffic flow simulation. In this study, 45,031 groups of ship AIS data from the non-bridge area between the Yangtze River Bridge and the second bridge in Wuhan section of the Yangtze River Channel in 2015 were selected. After time synchronization and coordinate transformation, ship overtaking behavior data were classified and extracted to establish a classification behavior database. In combination with the determination of the characteristic dimension, the evaluation index of overtaking and crossing behavior was established, and the features of overtaking and crossing behavior were mined accordingly. Based on the idea of decision tree and distance discrimination, the index discrimination method was used to construct the ship overtaking behavior prediction model. By building the ship overtaking behavior prediction model, a total of 1342 records of 109 ships with overtaking situations were selected for comparative verification. The accuracy of the verification tests of the behavior pattern prediction were more than 92% within 180 seconds and more than 98% within 90 seconds.

Pathomic Fusion: An Integrated Framework for Fusing Histopathology and Genomic Features for Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis,"Cancer diagnosis, prognosis, mymargin and therapeutic response predictions are based on morphological information from histology slides and molecular profiles from genomic data. However, most deep learning-based objective outcome prediction and grading paradigms are based on histology or genomics alone and do not make use of the complementary information in an intuitive manner. In this work, we propose Pathomic Fusion, an interpretable strategy for end-to-end multimodal fusion of histology image and genomic (mutations, CNV, RNA-Seq) features for survival outcome prediction. Our approach models pairwise feature interactions across modalities by taking the Kronecker product of unimodal feature representations, and controls the expressiveness of each representation via a gating-based attention mechanism. Following supervised learning, we are able to interpret and saliently localize features across each modality, and understand how feature importance shifts when conditioning on multimodal input. We validate our approach using glioma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which contains paired whole-slide image, genotype, and transcriptome data with ground truth survival and histologic grade labels. In a 15-fold cross-validation, our results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal fusion paradigm improves prognostic determinations from ground truth grading and molecular subtyping, as well as unimodal deep networks trained on histology and genomic data alone. The proposed method establishes insight and theory on how to train deep networks on multimodal biomedical data in an intuitive manner, which will be useful for other problems in medicine that seek to combine heterogeneous data streams for understanding diseases and predicting response and resistance to treatment.

A Novel Encoding and Decoding Calibration Guiding Pathway for Pathological Image Analysis,"Diagnostic pathology is the foundation and gold standard for identifying carcinomas, and the accurate quantification of pathological images can provide objective clues for pathologists to make more convincing diagnosis. Recently, the encoder-decoder architectures (EDAs) of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in the analysis of pathological images. Despite the rapid innovation of EDAs, we have conducted extensive experiments based on a variety of commonly used EDAs, and found them cannot handle the interference of complex background in pathological images, making the architectures unable to focus on the regions of interest (RoIs), thus making the quantitative results unreliable. Therefore, we proposed a pathway named GLobal Bank (GLB) to guide the encoder and the decoder to extract more features of RoIs rather than the complex background. Sufficient experiments have proved that the architecture remoulded by GLB can achieve significant performance improvement, and the quantitative results are more accurate.",Decoding;Computer architecture;Pathology;Feature extraction;Convolution;Calibration;Backpropagation;Global bank;encoder;decoder;CNN;RoIs,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2020.3023467
Consistent Estimation of the Max-Flow Problem: Towards Unsupervised Image Segmentation,"Advances in the image-based diagnostics of complex biological and manufacturing processes have brought unsupervised image segmentation to the forefront of enabling automated, on the fly decision making. However, most existing unsupervised segmentation approaches are either computationally complex or require manual parameter selection (e.g., flow capacities in max-flow/min-cut segmentation). In this work, we present a fully unsupervised segmentation approach using a continuous max-flow formulation over the image domain while optimally estimating the flow parameters from the image characteristics. More specifically, we show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of the image labels can be formulated as a continuous max-flow problem given the flow capacities are known. The flow capacities are then iteratively obtained by employing a novel Markov random field prior over the image domain. We present theoretical results to establish the posterior consistency of the flow capacities. We compare the performance of our approach using brain tumor image segmentation, defect identification in additively manufactured components using electron microscopic images, and segmentation of multiple real-world images. Comparative results with several state-of-the-art supervised as well as unsupervised methods suggest that the present method performs statistically similar to the supervised methods, but results in more than 90 percent improvement in the Dice score when compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",Image segmentation;Minimization;TV;Estimation;Tumors;Markov processes;Manuals;Continuous max-flow;unsupervised image segmentation;maximum a posteriori estimation;posterior consistency,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3039745
A Feature Weighting-Assisted Approach for Cancer Subtypes Identification From Paired Expression Profiles,"Identification of cancer subtypes is critically important for understanding the heterogeneity present in tumors. Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have made available the data-sets containing expression profiles of multiple types of biomarkers across the same set of samples. Availability of these types of data-sets help in capturing heterogeneity underlying, complex biological processes and phenotypes. Further, by integrating information from multiple sources, homogeneous groups for cancer can be identified. However, there is a lack of computational approaches to identify histological subtypes among the patients suffering from different types of cancers. Assigning weight to the biomarkers prior to the integration of multiple information sources for the same set of samples can play an important role in cancer subtypes identification, which has not been explored previously. Sub-typing of cancers can help in analyzing shared molecular profiles between different histological subtypes of solid tumors. This can further help in designing appropriate therapies and treatments. A novel method for feature weighting based on robust regression fit is developed in this study. This method assigns a weight to every biomarker on the basis of variability present across the samples. Later, this weight is utilized to find similarity between patients individually from each of the information sources. In this study, the two information sources that have been utilized are miRNA and mRNA expression profiles across the same set of samples. Patient-similarity networks, that are generated from each of the expression profiles are then integrated using the approach of Similarity Network Fusion. Finally, Spectral clustering is applied on the fused network to identify similar groups of patients that represent a cancer subtype. To establish the efficiency of the proposed approach, it has been applied to three types of cancer data-sets and is also compared with the other existing methods.",Cancer;Biomarkers;Standards;Gene expression;Databases;Tumors;Ovarian cancer;Cancer subtypes;biomarkers;histological subtypes;feature weighting;robust regression,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2020.3041723
A Multimodality-Contribution-Aware TripNet for Histologic Grading of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of primary liver malignant tumor with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis even undergoing resection or transplantation. Accurate discrimination of the histologic grades of HCC plays a critical role in the management and therapy of HCC patients. In this paper, we discuss a deep learning-based diagnostic model for HCC histologic grading with multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to overcome the problem of limited well-annotated data and extract the discriminated fusion feature referring to the clinical diagnosis experience of radiologists. Accordingly, we propose a novel Multimodality-Contribution-Aware TripNet (MCAT) based on the metric learning and the attention-aware weighted multimodal fusion. The novelty of the method lies in the multimodality small-shot learning architecture designation and the multimodality adaptive weighted computing scheme. The comprehensive experiments are done on the clinic dataset with the well-annotation of lesion location by the professional radiologist. The experimental results show that our proposed MCAT is not only able to achieve acceptable quantitative measuring of HCC histologic grading based on the MRI sequences with small cases but also outperforms previous models in HCC histologic grading, reaching an accuracy of 84 percent, a sensitivity of 87 percent and precision of 89 percent.",Magnetic resonance imaging;Lesions;Medical diagnostic imaging;Training;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Tumors;Noninvasive diagnosis;histologic grading of hepatocellular carcinoma;multimodality-contribution-aware attention weighting;multimodality fusion;small-shot learning,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3079216

In this scenario it is particularly important to study the role of mechanical stress on cancer progression. Mechanical cues are already known to be important in key cancer processes such as survival, proliferation, and migration. However, probing cell mechanical properties within microfluidic platforms has not been achievable with current technologies since samples are not easily accessible within most microfluidic channels. Methods: Here, to analyze the mechanical properties of cells within a perfusion chamber, we use Brillouin confocal microscopy, an all-optical technique that requires no contact or perturbation to the sample. Results: Our results indicate that ovarian cancer nodules under long-term continuous flow have a significantly lower longitudinal modulus compared to nodules maintained in a static condition. Conclusion: We further dissect the role of distinct mechanical perturbations (e.g., shear flow, osmolality) on tumor nodule properties. Significance: In summary, the unique combination of a long-term microfluidic culture and noninvasive mechanical analysis technique provides insights on the effects of physical forces in ovarian cancer pathology.",Scattering;Tumors;Ovarian cancer;Stress;Microscopy;Microfluidics;Cancer;Brillouin microscopy;mechanical properties;ovarian cancer;shear flow,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2021.3092641
Evolution of Ethereum Transaction Relationships: Toward Understanding Global Driving Factors From Microscopic Patterns,"Much of the current research in Ethereum transaction records focuses on the statistical analysis and measurements of existing data; however, the evolution mechanism of Ethereum transactions is an important, yet seldom discussed issue. In this work, we first collect the transaction data of Ethereum and build network models from a microlevel view and then use a link-prediction-based framework to quantify the impact of network characteristics on Ethereum evolution. Next, we explore the graph structure properties and the driving factors of newly generated transaction relationships. Experimental results show that the local and microscopic structure of Ethereum networks is star-shaped, and the transaction frequency of addresses has a great impact on the evolution of Ethereum transaction relationships. First-layer nodes of microstructures dominate the network evolution. Moreover, the degree of addresses is an effective basis for predicting the direction of new transactions. Potential further studies on Ethereum transaction link prediction are discussed, for example, the label effect of center addresses.",Blockchain;Feature extraction;Cryptocurrency;Smart contracts;Prediction algorithms;Microscopy;Data mining;Complex network;cryptocurrency;Ethereum;network evolution;transaction relationships,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,10.1109/TCSS.2021.3093384
Unsupervised Health Indicator Construction by a Novel Degradation-Trend-Constrained Variational Autoencoder and Its Applications,"Health indicator (HI) affects the accuracy and reliability of the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model. The hidden variables of variational autoencoder (VAE) can represent the HI values for a life-cycle dataset with obvious degradation trend. However, for an irregular dataset of a rotary machine, it is still a great challenge to construct the HI that can effectively represent the machinery degradation tendency. Therefore, this article proposes a novel degradation-trend-constrained VAE (DTC-VAE) to construct the HI vector with the distinct degradation trend. First, the multidimensional time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics are calculated via the collected vibration samples. Second, a new degradation-constraint loss term is proposed and introduced into VAE for constructing DTC-VAE. Third, with the multidimensional features and DTC-VAE, various HIs can be generated without supervision. The proposed method is applied to construct the HI vectors of bearing life-cycle datasets and gear fatigue datasets, and then macroscopic-microscopic-attention-based long short term memory (MMALSTM) is used to predict the corresponding RULs with the constructed HIs. Via several contrast experiments, the results prove that the proposed unsupervised HI construction approach is superior to other typical methods, and the obtained HI vectors are more suitable for the RUL prediction.",Degradation;Market research;Feature extraction;Mechatronics;Vibrations;Gears;Health indicator (HI);multidimensional features;nonsupervision;remaining useful life (RUL);variational autoencoder (VAE),ARTICLE,2022,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,10.1109/TMECH.2021.3098737
Multiparametric Quantitative US Examination of Liver Fibrosis: A Feature-Engineering and Machine-Learning Based Analysis,"Quantitative ultrasound (QUS), which attempts to extract quantitative features from the US radiofrequency (RF) or envelope data for tissue characterization, is becoming a promising technique for noninvasive assessments of liver fibrosis. However, the number of feature variables examined and finally used in the existing QUS methods is typically small, limiting the diagnostic performance. Therefore, this paper devises a new multiparametric QUS (MP-QUS) method which enables the extraction of a large number of feature variables from US RF signals and allows for the use of feature-engineering and machine-learning based algorithms for liver fibrosis assessment. In the MP-QUS, eighty-four feature variables were extracted from multiple QUS parametric maps derived from the RF signals and the envelope data. Afterwards, feature reduction and selection were performed in turn to remove the feature redundancy and identify the best combination of features in the reduced feature set. Finally, a variety of machine-learning algorithms were tested for fibrosis classification with the selected features, based on the results of which the optimal classifier was established. The performance of the proposed MP-QUS method for staging liver fibrosis was evaluated on an animal model, with histologic examination as the reference standard. The mean accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve achieved by MP-QUS are respectively 83.38%, 86.04%, 80.82%, and 0.891 for recognizing significant liver fibrosis, and 85.50%, 88.92%, 85.24%, and 0.924 for diagnosing liver cirrhosis. The proposed MP-QUS method paves a way for its future extension to assess liver fibrosis in human subjects.",Liver;Feature extraction;RF signals;Radio frequency;Ultrasonic imaging;Imaging;Radio access technologies;Liver fibrosis;quantitative ultrasound;feature engineering;radiomics;machine learning,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3100319
MiSTR: A Multiview Structural-Temporal Learning Framework for Rumor Detection,"With the rapid development of web technology, social media platforms have become a breeding ground for rumors. These rumors can threaten people’s health, endanger the economy, and affect the stability of a country. In recent years, to mitigate the problem of rumors, computational detection of rumors has been studied, producing some promising early results. However, how to effectively capture the temporal information of retweet dynamics and the structural information of propagation structure is still neglected. In this article, we innovatively propose a novel Multiview Structural-Temporal Learning Framework for Rumor Detection, MiSTR, to jointly learn the temporal features of retweet dynamics, structural features of propagation graph, and the textual features of source tweet. More specifically, we utilize the timestamp encoding, and timestamp level and sequential level attention mechanisms to learn the temporal correlation among individual retweets. We propose two specific methods to learn the overall representation of propagation structure among users from both microscopic and mesoscopic perspectives. Encouraging empirical results on three real large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.",Feature extraction;Social networking (online);Media;Convolutional neural networks;Social computing;Microscopy;Graph neural networks;Learning systems;Social media;information propagation;rumor detection;graph neural networks,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Big Data,10.1109/TBDATA.2021.3107481
Relation-Aware Shared Representation Learning for Cancer Prognosis Analysis With Auxiliary Clinical Variables and Incomplete Multi-Modality Data,"The integrative analysis of complementary phenotype information contained in multi-modality data (e.g., histopathological images and genomic data) has advanced the prognostic evaluation of cancers. However, multi-modality based prognosis analysis confronts two challenges: (1) how to explore underlying relations inherent in different modalities data for learning compact and discriminative multi-modality representations; (2) how to take full consideration of incomplete multi-modality data for constructing accurate and robust prognostic model, since a host of complete multi-modality data are not always available. Additionally, many existing multi-modality based prognostic methods commonly ignore relevant clinical variables (e.g., grade and stage), which, however, may provide supplemental information to promote the performance of model. In this paper, we propose a relation-aware shared representation learning method for prognosis analysis of cancers, which makes full use of clinical information and incomplete multi-modality data. The proposed method learns multi-modal shared space tailored for prognostic model via a dual mapping. Within the shared space, it equips with relational regularizers to explore the potential relations (i.e., feature-label and feature-feature relations) among multi-modality data for inducing discriminatory representations and simultaneously obtaining extra sparsity for alleviating overfitting. Moreover, it regresses and incorporates multiple auxiliary clinical attributes with dynamic coefficients to meliorate performance. Furthermore, in training stage, a partial mapping strategy is employed to extend and train a more reliable model with incomplete multi-modality data. We have evaluated our method on three public datasets derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.",Cancer;Prognostics and health management;Data models;Training;Genomics;Clinical diagnosis;Bioinformatics;Prognosis analysis;shared representations;auxiliary clinical variables;incomplete multi-modality data,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2021.3108802
FABNet: Fusion Attention Block and Transfer Learning for Laryngeal Cancer Tumor Grading in P63 IHC Histopathology Images,"Laryngeal cancer tumor (LCT) grading is a challenging task in P63 Immunohistochemical (IHC) histopathology images due to small differences between LCT levels in pathology images, the lack of precision in lesion regions of interest (LROIs) and the paucity of LCT pathology image samples. The key to solving the LCT grading problem is to transfer knowledge from other images and to identify more accurate LROIs, but the following problems occur: 1) transferring knowledge without a priori experience often causes negative transfer and creates a heavy workload due to the abundance of image types, and 2) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) constructing deep models by stacking cannot sufficiently identify LROIs, often deviate significantly from the LROIs focused on by experienced pathologists, and are prone to providing misleading second opinions. So we propose a novel fusion attention block network (FABNet) to address these problems. First, we propose a model transfer method based on clinical a priori experience and sample analysis (CPESA) that analyzes the transfer ability by integrating clinical a priori experience using indicators such as the relationship between the cancer onset location and morphology and the texture and staining degree of cell nuclei in histopathology images; our method further validates these indicators by the probability distribution of cancer image samples. Then, we propose a fusion attention block (FAB) structure, which can both provide an advanced non-uniform sparse representation of images and extract spatial relationship information between nuclei; consequently, the LROI can be more accurate and more relevant to pathologists. We conducted extensive experiments, compared with the best Baseline model, the classification accuracy is improved 25%, and It is demonstrated that FABNet performs better on different cancer pathology image datasets and outperforms other state of the art (SOTA) models.",Cancer;Analytical models;Transfer learning;Histopathology;Breast cancer;Computational modeling;Lesions;Laryngeal cancer tumor (LCT) grading;attention mechanism;transfer learning;fusion attention block (FAB);lesion region of interest (LROI),ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3108999
Screening of Alzheimer’s Disease With Multiwavelength Stokes Polarimetry in a Mouse Model,"The minimum histological criterion for the diagnostics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in tissue is the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in specific brain locations. The routine procedure of morphological analysis implies time-consuming and laborious steps including sectioning and staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. We developed a multispectral Stokes polarimetric imaging approach that allows characterization of FFPE brain tissue samples to discern the stages of AD progression without sectioning and staining the tissue. The Stokes polarimetry approach is highly sensitive to structural alterations of brain tissue, particularly to the changes in light scattering and birefringence. We present the results of the label-free non-destructive screening of FFPE mouse brain tissue and show several polarization metrics that demonstrate statistically significant differences for tissues at different stages of AD.",Brain;Polarimetry;Mice;Measurement by laser beam;Laser beams;Microscopy;Optical microscopy;Optical polarimetry;scattering;birefringence;Aβ plaques;Stokes vector,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2021.3129700
Disease-Specific Imaging Utilizing Support Vector Machine Classification of H-Scan Parameters: Assessment of Steatosis in a Rat Model,"In medical imaging, quantitative measurements have shown promise in identifying diseases by classifying normal versus pathological parameters from tissues. The support vector machine (SVM) has shown promise as a supervised classification algorithm and has been widely used. However, the classification results typically identify a category of abnormal tissues but do not necessarily differentiate progressive stages of a disease. Moreover, the classification result is typically provided independently as a supplement to medical images, which contributes to an overload of information sources in the clinic. Hence, we propose a new imaging method utilizing the SVM to integrate classification results into medical images. This framework is called disease-specific imaging (DSI) that produces a color overlaid highlight on B-mode ultrasound images indicating the type, location, and severity of pathology from different conditions. In this article, the SVM training was performed to construct hyperplanes that can differentiate normal, fibrosis, steatosis, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) metastases in livers based on ultrasound echoes. Also, cluster centroids for specific diseases define unique disease axes, and the inner product between measured features and any disease axis selected by the SVM quantifies the disease progression. The features were measured from 2794 ultrasound frames using the H-scan analysis, attenuation estimation, and B-mode image analysis.

Intra- and Inter-Pair Consistency for Semi-Supervised Gland Segmentation,"Accurate gland segmentation in histology tissue images is a critical but challenging task. Although deep models have demonstrated superior performance in medical image segmentation, they commonly require a large amount of annotated data, which are hard to obtain due to the extensive labor costs and expertise required. In this paper, we propose an intra- and inter-pair consistency-based semi-supervised (I2CS) model that can be trained on both labeled and unlabeled histology images for gland segmentation. Considering that each image contains glands and hence different images could potentially share consistent semantics in the feature space, we introduce a novel intra- and inter-pair consistency module to explore such consistency for learning with unlabeled data. It first characterizes the pixel-level relation between a pair of images in the feature space to create an attention map that highlights the regions with the same semantics but on different images. Then, it imposes a consistency constraint on the attention maps obtained from multiple image pairs, and thus filters low-confidence attention regions to generate refined attention maps that are then merged with original features to improve their representation ability. In addition, we also design an object-level loss to address the issues caused by touching glands. We evaluated our model against several recent gland segmentation methods and three typical semi-supervised methods on the GlaS and CRAG datasets. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed due consistency module and Obj-Dice loss, but also indicate that the proposed I2CS model achieves state-of-the-art gland segmentation performance on both benchmarks.",Glands;Image segmentation;Semantics;Feature extraction;Histopathology;Training;Data models;Gland segmentation;semi-supervised learning;pairwise learning;deep convolutional neural network,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,10.1109/TIP.2021.3136716
Anisotropic Etching of CVD Grown Graphene for Ammonia Sensing,"Bare chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene (GRP) was anisotropically etched with various etching parameters. The morphological and structural characterizations were carried out by optical microscopy and the vibrational properties substrates were obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The ammonia adsorption and desorption behavior of graphene-based sensors were recorded via quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements at room temperature. The etched samples for ambient NH3 exhibited nearly 35% improvement and showed high resistance to humidity molecules when compared to bare graphene. Besides exhibiting promising sensitivity to NH3 molecules, the etched graphene-based sensors were less affected by humidity. The experimental results were collaborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and it was shown that while water molecules fragmented into H and O, NH3 interacts weakly with EGPR2 sample which reveals the enhanced sensing ability of EGPR2. Apparently, it would be more suitable to use EGRP2 in sensing applications due to its sensitivity to NH3 molecules, its stability, and its resistance to H2O molecules in humid ambient.",Graphene;Sensors;Etching;Fluid flow;Optical microscopy;Microscopy;Sensitivity;Graphene;ammonia;QCM;hydrogen etching;anisotropic etching;gas sensors,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Sensors Journal,10.1109/JSEN.2022.3146220
Dual-Task ConvLSTM-UNet for Instance Segmentation of Weakly Annotated Microscopy Videos,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are considered state of the art segmentation methods for biomedical images in general and microscopy sequences of living cells, in particular. The success of the CNNs is attributed to their ability to capture the structural properties of the data, which enables accommodating complex spatial structures of the cells, low contrast, and unclear boundaries. However, in their standard form CNNs do not exploit the temporal information available in time-lapse sequences, which can be crucial to separating touching and partially overlapping cell instances. In this work, we exploit cell dynamics using a novel CNN architecture which allows multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. Specifically, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture is proposed based on the integration of a Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network with the U-Net. The proposed ConvLSTM-UNet network is constructed as a dual-task network to enable training with weakly annotated data, in the form of approximate cell centers, termed markers, when the complete cells’ outlines are not available. We further use the fast marching method to facilitate the partitioning of clustered cells into individual connected components. Finally, we suggest an adaptation of the method for 3D microscopy sequences without drastically increasing the computational load. The method was evaluated on the Cell Segmentation Benchmark and was ranked among the top three methods on six submitted datasets. Exploiting the proposed built-in marker estimator we also present state-of-the-art cell detection results for an additional, publicly available, weekly annotated dataset.

Cross-Boosted Multi-Target Domain Adaptation for Multi-Modality Histopathology Image Translation and Segmentation,"Recent digital pathology workflows mainly focus on mono-modality histopathology image analysis. However, they ignore the complementarity between Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Immunohistochemically (IHC) stained images, which can provide comprehensive gold standard for cancer diagnosis. To resolve this issue, we propose a cross-boosted multi-target domain adaptation pipeline for multi-modality histopathology images, which contains Cross-frequency Style-auxiliary Translation Network (CSTN) and Dual Cross-boosted Segmentation Network (DCSN). Firstly, CSTN achieves the one-to-many translation from fluorescence microscopy images to H&E and IHC images for providing source domain training data. To generate images with realistic color and texture, Cross-frequency Feature Transfer Module (CFTM) is developed to pertinently restructure and normalize high-frequency content and low-frequency style features from different domains. Then, DCSN fulfills multi-target domain adaptive segmentation, where a dual-branch encoder is introduced, and Bidirectional Cross-domain Boosting Module (BCBM) is designed to implement cross-modality information complementation through bidirectional inter-domain collaboration. Finally, we establish Multi-modality Thymus Histopathology (MThH) dataset, which is the largest publicly available H&E and IHC image benchmark. Experiments on MThH dataset and several public datasets show that the proposed pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both histopathology image translation and segmentation.",Image segmentation;Histopathology;Frequency modulation;Pipelines;Hafnium;Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Multi-modality histopathology image;multi-target domain adaptation;cross-frequency feature transfer;bidirectional cross-domain boosting,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3153793
Joint Deformable Image Registration and ADC Map Regularization: Application to DWI-Based Lymphoma Classification,"The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) is considered an importantimaging biomarker contributing to the assessment of tissue microstructure and pathophy- siology. It is calculated from Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI) by means of a diffusion model, usually without considering any motion during image acquisition. We propose a method to improve the computation of the ADC by coping jointly with both motion artifacts in whole-body DWI (through group-wise registration) and possible instrumental noise in the diffusion model. The proposed deformable registration method yielded on average the lowest ADC reconstruction error on data with simulated motion and diffusion. Moreover, our approach was applied on whole-body diffusion weighted images obtained with five different b-values from a cohort of 38 patients with histologically confirmed lymphomas of three different types (Hodgkin, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma). Evaluation on the real data showed that ADC-based features, extracted using our joint optimization approach classified lymphomas with an accuracy of approximately 78.6% (yielding a 11% increase in respect to the standard features extracted from unregistered diffusion-weighted images). Furthermore, the correlation between diffusion characteristics and histopathological findings was higher than any other previous approach of ADC computation.",Strain;Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Neoplasms;Image registration;Estimation;Visualization;ADC;b-values;classification;deformable;discrete;lymphoma;registration,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3156009
Predicting Multi-level Classification of Breast Cancer Image by using Three FCM Variants,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women, after lung cancer. Its initial realization, on the other hand, may significantly improve the chances of patient survival. Histopathological images of impacted tissues acquired from surgical biopsies provide adequate visual information to differentiate between breast cancer types. Breast Cancer Histopathological Images Analysis (BCHIA) is a widely used method for detecting abnormal pathological alterations in breast cancer. In this paper, we propose a machine learning technique for classifying the cancer cells in two classes and subsequently classifying them into one of four sub classes in each category. In this context the Breast Cancer(BC) dataset with 7780 histopathology images scanned at 40X, 100X, 200X and 400X magnification level is used for examination and early detection of breast cancer. We have used histopathology images as they are considered safe in comparison to other radiology imaging techniques. Additionally three variants of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) image segmentation techniques are proposed namely GEFCM (Gaussian-Euclidean Fuzzy C-Means), GMFCM (Gaussian-Minkowski Fuzzy C-Means), and GMHFCM (Gaussian-ManHattan Fuzzy C-Means). These techniques are developed with the help of Gaussian kernels RBF (radial basis function) and three different distances measuring functions namely Euclidean distance, Minkowski distance, and ManHattan (Texi-Cab) distance functions. The calculated features using these three techniques of image segmentation are classified into one of BC type using multi-class SVM. The implementation of proposed data model is performed using MATLAB tool. Additionally for justification the accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score is measured. The experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of GMHFCM (Gaussian-ManHattan Fuzzy C-Means) based extracted edge features.",Support vector machines;Image segmentation;Visualization;Histopathology;Surgery;Machine learning;Radiology;Breast Cancer cell classification;Image Segmentation;Gaussian Radial basis function;Multiclass SVM,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 International Conference for Advancement in Technology (ICONAT),10.1109/ICONAT53423.2022.9725843
HyperUNet for Medical Hyperspectral Image Segmentation on a Choledochal Database,"Microscopy medical hyperspectral images, which are characterized in multiple observation bands under different spectral frequencies, contain profuse spectral information for disease diagnosis. Consequently, an increasing number of deep learning methods have recently been proposed to solve the medical hyperspectral image segmentation task. In this study, we propose a new segmentation network (HyperUNet) as a better version of UNet for medical hyperspectral image segmentation on a choledochal database. Considering the useless spectral in-formation that exists in the hyperspectral image that is irrelevant to our task, HyperUNet first uses the linear transformation block to extract the useful spectral information from the hyperspectral image, and then applies the UNet model to it to capture the tumor area. Finally, when reconstructing the mask, HyperUNet applies the multi -scale loss function in cases of underuse and overuse of low-level detailed features and high-level semantic features. We compare our HyperUNet to other competing methods, and the results show that our HyperUNet is superior.",Image segmentation;Databases;Microscopy;Semantics;Medical diagnosis;Task analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;medical hyperspectral image;UNet;linear trans-formation block;multi-scale loss;HyperUNet,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE),10.1109/ICCE53296.2022.9730171
Automated Cell Tracking Using Adaptive Multi-stage Kalman Filter In Time-laps Images,"Segmenting living cells and tracking their movement in microscopy images are significant in biological studies and have played a crucial role in disease diagnosis, targeted therapy, drug delivery, and many other medical applications. Due to a large amount of time-lapse image data, automated image analysis can be a proper alternative to manual analysis, which is unreasonably time-consuming. However, Low-resolution microscopic images, unpredictable cell behavior, and multiple cell divisions make automated cell tracking challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-object tracking approach guided by a two-stage adaptive Kalman forecast. Cell segmentation is performed using an edge detector combined with various morphological operations. The tracking section includes two general stages. At first, a Kalman filter with a constant speed is used to estimate the position of each cell in consecutive frames. The primary Kalman filter was able to detect a significant percentage of cells, but the high rate of cell division and migration of cells in or out of the field of view has caused errors in the final result. In the next stage, a secondary Kalman filter with modified parameters extracted from the results of initial tracking is proposed to estimate the position of cells in each frame, decrease errors, and improve the tracking results. Experimental results indicate that our method is 94.37% accurate in segmenting cells. The validity of the whole method has been conducted by comparing the results of the proposed method with manual tracking results, which demonstrates its efficiency.",Image segmentation;Target tracking;Motion segmentation;Microscopy;Object segmentation;Cells (biology);Manuals;Adaptive tracking;Cell tracking;Cell segmentation;Kalman filter,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 International Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing (MVIP),10.1109/MVIP53647.2022.9738793
Progress of Machine Vision in the Detection of Cancer Cells in Histopathology,"In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, machine vision technology has been widely used in various fields. Traditional cancer detection methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on the experience of pathologists; therefore, these methods cannot meet the needs of modern medical treatment. Machine vision overcomes the disadvantages of traditional detection methods in cancer detection and can help pathologists improve the detection accuracy. According to the requirements of medical detection, this review summarizes the applications of machine vision in the detection of cancer cells in histopathological images and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods in image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and recognition.

Experimental comparison of ten state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms for segmenting leukocyte nucleus,"There have been manifold dangerous health conditions such as leukemia, anemia, and polycythemia that can be diagnosed by analyzing the count and ratio of different types of leukocytes. The microscopic analysis of leukocyte morphology has a significant role in the effective diagnosis of hematological disorders. However, manual analysis under a microscope is stressful, dreary, inaccurate, and highly subjective because of the inherent complexity of leukocyte morphology. It has been recommended in digital hematology to use image segmentation as an important device for performing robust, accurate, and automatic analysis of Leukocyte nuclei. Leukocyte nuclei segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided analysis because further processing phases are highly influenced by the segmentation results. However, leukocyte nuclei segmentation is generally challenging because of its morphological diversity plus variation in illumination and contrast imbalance resulting from multifarious methods and instruments used for image acquisition. Consequently, ten state-of-the-art saliency segmentation algorithms were experimentally compared in this study using the recently published Raabin_White blood cell dataset and standard performance evaluation metrics to help decide the best algorithm for automatic segmentation of leukocyte nuclei. This study recommends a new segmentation algorithm based on color histogram clustering that has demonstrated the properties of salient objects as adequate for the segmentation of leukocyte nuclei.",Performance evaluation;Manifolds;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Clustering algorithms;Morphology;Object detection;Digital hematology;Image segmentation;Leukocyte image;Leukocyte morphology;Saliency segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 Conference on Information Communications Technology and Society (ICTAS),10.1109/ICTAS53252.2022.9744693
Improving Human Sperm Head Morphology Classification With Unsupervised Anatomical Feature Distillation,"With rising male infertility, sperm head morphology classification becomes critical for accurate and timely clinical diagnosis. Recent deep learning (DL) morphology analysis methods achieve promising benchmark results, but leave performance and robustness on the table by relying on limited and possibly noisy class labels. To address this, we introduce a new DL training framework that leverages anatomical and image priors from human sperm microscopy crops to extract useful features without additional labeling cost. Our core idea is to distill sperm head information with reliably-generated pseudo-masks and unsupervised spatial prediction tasks. The predicted foreground masks from this distillation step are then leveraged to regularize and reduce image and label noise in the tuning stage. We evaluate our new approach on two public sperm datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances (e.g. 65.9% SCIAN accuracy and 96.5% HuSHeM accuracy).",Training;Head;Costs;Smoothing methods;Morphology;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Sperm morphology classification;unsupervised pretraining;computer-aided semen analysis (CASA),INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI52829.2022.9761633
A Hybrid Multi-Object Segmentation Framework with Model-Based B-Splines for Microbial Single Cell Analysis,"In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for multi-object microbial cell segmentation. The approach combines an ML-based detection with a geometry-aware variational-based segmentation using B-splines that are parametrized based on a geometric model of the cell shape. The detection is done first using YOLOv5. In a second step, each detected cell is segmented individually. Thus, the segmentation only needs to be done on a per-cell basis, which makes it amenable to a variational approach that incorporates prior knowledge on the geometry. Here, the contour of the segmentation is modelled as closed uniform cubic B-spline, whose control points are parametrized using the known cell geometry. Compared to purely ML-based segmentation approaches, which need accurate segmentation maps as training data that are very laborious to produce, our method just needs bounding boxes as training data. Still, the proposed method performs on par with ML-based segmentation approaches usually used in this context. We study the performance of the proposed method on time-lapse microscopy data of Corynebacterium glutamicum.",Geometry;Image segmentation;Analytical models;Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Training data;Organisms;B-Splines;microfluidic single cell analysis;cell segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI52829.2022.9761575
Multiple Instance Learning with Task-Specific Multi-Level Features for Weakly Annotated Histopathological Image Classification,"Pathological examination is regarded as the gold standard for cancer diagnosis in clinical medicine. Gigapixel histopathological images play an important role in developing automatic pathology diagnosis systems. Because of the expensive cost of pixel-level annotation, deep multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the main approach to classify histopatho-logical images with only slide-level annotation. However, three major challenges including lack of data efficiency because MIL approaches rely on task-agnostic feature extractor, overfitting challenges caused by high data imbalance between tumor and normal tissues, and the similarity between tumor and normal patches, are to be tackled. We proposed a three-stage deep MIL approach to address these challenges. The first stage generated pseudo instance-level labels by utilizing max-max ranking loss. The second stage refined the feature extractor into a task-specific feature extractor with pseudo labels. Focal loss was used to tackle the data imbalance challenge. Partial decoder component was adopted to better distinguish tumor tissues. We re-trained the MIL network with task-specific multi-level features in the third stage.

AFM Tip Localization and Efficient Scanning Method for MEMS Inspection,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used in different fields, such as nanotechnology, semiconductor, microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs), bioscience, and so on. In the case of obtaining the 3-D topography of a large-scale MEMS sample, it is hard to localize the AFM tip position without other auxiliary microscopes in the unknown sample before scanning. Thus, in this article, the relative probe position on the MEMS layout map can be obtained, such that the probe can be moved and placed near the interesting region to start the inspection. However, the AFM scanned images on a MEMS sample typically involve only simple geometries with sparse features, which usually leads to localization difficulty. In this research, an AFM tip localization method was proposed by using the particle filter, referring to the macrorobot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technique. The AFM scanned images are treated as the unique sensor and the sample layout as the map. The sensor model of the particle filter is based on a feature extraction algorithm. After localization, the interesting area is scanned using a novel efficient scanning method combining online variable speed scan and learning-based feedforward control. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, both tremendous simulations and experiments are conducted, and the results of the tip localization and efficient scanning on a MEMS sample are highly promising.",Location awareness;Micromechanical devices;Microscopy;Particle filters;Probes;Optical microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy;Atomic force microscopy (AFM);efficient scanning method;feedforward control;online variable speed scan;particle filter;tip localization,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2022.3175250
A 13.1mm2 512 × 256 Multimodal CMOS Array for Spatiochemical Imaging of Bacterial Biofilms,"Biotechnology applications are increasingly turning to CMOS integrated biosensor arrays for massive parallelism and increased throughput in biomolecular diagnostics [1], [2]. Yet many opportunities still remain to take advantage of the spatially-resolved nature of dense semiconductor platforms to open up new imaging dimensions [3], [4], [5] which complement traditional microscopy. To better understand the emergence of spatial organization in living systems, we require techniques that dynamically probe the spatial structure of assemblies of millions of cells or more. Optical microscopy is the dominant technique, but large field-of-view microscopes have an inherent tradeoff with resolving fine features. Confocal microscopes can image cellular-scale 3D structures, but their bright illumination can impart severe phototoxicity, and observing large areas can be prohibitively slow.",Optical microscopy;Three-dimensional displays;Microscopy;Organizations;Parallel processing;Turning;Throughput,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC),10.1109/CICC53496.2022.9772787
Transfer Learning-Based Neuronal Cell Instance Segmentation With Pointwise Attentive Path Fusion,"Accurate instance segmentation is essential for the behavior and morphology analysis of neuronal cells. The main challenges of this segmentation task involve irregular and concave cell morphology, low contrast on cell boundaries, cell clustering and adhesion, and the background noise in the phase contrast microscopy (PCM) images. To address these challenges, we propose a learning pipeline with three performance boosters that have not been extensively explored in prior studies, including transferring knowledge from a model pre-trained on a larger but similar dataset, enhancing the contrast of cells in a PCM image, and a pointwise attentive path fusion module that allows the learning model to capture informative features from critical areas. Experiments have been conducted on the Sartorius Cell Instance Segmentation dataset with three neuronal cell lines. Results show that the final model, with three boosters enabled, brings an mAP gain of 10.3%. Compared to the top three places on the leaderboard, our method shows comparable performance without using any ensemble method, making our model the state-of-the-art solution among the single model-based methods.",Image segmentation;Phase change materials;Morphology;Task analysis;Annotations;Microscopy;Behavioral sciences;Datasets;neural networks;medical images process;transfer learning,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176956
A Generic Algorithm for Position-Orientation Estimation With Microscopic Vision,"Position and orientation (PO) estimation with microscopic vision is essential for various micromanipulation tasks. Herein, to improve the accuracy and flexibility of PO estimation, a generic algorithm is proposed based on discriminative correlation filter (DCF), in which a position-estimator and an orientation-estimator are combined into one framework with the developed mutual correction mechanism. The extraction of spectral features is utilized to decouple the rotation and translation transformations of target. And DCF is employed to rapidly estimate the orientation. In addition, the continuous convolution operator is implemented to obtain subgrid resolution in the position-estimator. At last, both the stability and the accuracy of PO estimation are verified. The noise fluctuation in response distribution is effectively restrained to improve the robustness by the mutual correction mechanism. And the introduction of continuous convolution operation can improve the accuracy of position estimation too.

Cervical Cancer Cell Image Detection Method Based on Improved YOLOv4,"Aiming at the problem of frequent false and missed detection due to the dense and scattered distribution of cancer cells in the pathological images of cervical cancer cells, the complex image background, and the rich proportion of small objects, an improved image detection method of cervical cancer cells is proposed by combining the advantage of convolutional neural network and the transformer on the basis of the YOLOv4 network. Firstly, this method introduces the CoT module into the backbone feature extraction network of YOLOv4 to improve the global information acquisition ability of the model and the visual expression ability of the model. Secondly, according to the characteristics of the cervical cancer cell object detection dataset, data augmentation strategies such as Mosaic are used to enrich the dataset and improve the generalization ability of the model. Lastly, The improved method proposed is used to perform experiments on cervical cancer cell image dataset, and the corresponding results are obtained. The results show that the improved network model is significantly improved, which significantly improves the detection ability of cervical cancer cells and fully verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper.",Visualization;Pathology;Convolution;Computational modeling;Signal processing algorithms;Object detection;Feature extraction;cervical cancer;object detection;yolov4;transformer;data augmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 7th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing (ICSP),10.1109/ICSP54964.2022.9778577
SimSearch: A Human-in-The-Loop Learning Framework for Fast Detection of Regions of Interest in Microscopy Images,"Objective: Large-scale microscopy-based experiments often result in images with rich but sparse information content. An experienced microscopist can visually identify regions of interest (ROIs), but this becomes a cumbersome task with large datasets. Here we present SimSearch, a framework for quick and easy user-guided training of a deep neural model aimed at fast detection of ROIs in large-scale microscopy experiments. Methods: The user manually selects a small number of patches representing different classes of ROIs. This is followed by feature extraction using a pre-trained deep-learning model, and interactive patch selection pruning, resulting in a smaller set of clean (user approved) and larger set of noisy (unapproved) training patches of ROIs and background. The pre-trained deep-learning model is thereafter first trained on the large set of noisy patches, followed by refined training using the clean patches. Results: The framework is evaluated on fluorescence microscopy images from a large-scale drug screening experiment, brightfield images of immunohistochemistry-stained patient tissue samples, and malaria-infected human blood smears, as well as transmission electron microscopy images of cell sections. Compared to state-of-the-art and manual/visual assessment, the results show similar performance with maximal flexibility and minimal a priori information and user interaction. Conclusions: SimSearch quickly adapts to different data sets, which demonstrates the potential to speed up many microscopy-based experiments based on a small amount of user interaction. Significance: SimSearch can help biologists quickly extract informative regions and perform analyses on large datasets helping increase the throughput in a microscopy experiment.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Prototypes;Training;Noise measurement;Manuals;Deep learning;Human-in-the-loop;microscopy;autom- ation;self-supervised learning;semi-supervised learning,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3177602
AAEGAN Optimization by Purposeful Noise Injection for the Generation of Bright-Field Brain Organoid Images,"Brain organoids are three-dimensional tissues gener-ated in vitro from pluripotent stem cells and replicating the early development of Human brain. To implement, test and compare methods to follow their growth on microscopic images, a large dataset not always available is required with a trusted ground truth when developing automated Machine Learning solutions. Recently, optimized Generative Adversarial Networks prove to generate only a similar object content but not a background specific to the real acquisition modality. In this work, a small database of brain organoid bright field images, characterized by a shot noise background, is extended using the already validated AAEGAN architecture, and specific noise or a mixture noise injected in the generator. We hypothesize this noise injection could help to generate an homogeneous and similar bright-field background. To validate or invalidate our generated images we use metric calculation, and a dimensional reduction on features on original and generated images. Our result suggest that noise injection can modulate the generated image backgrounds in order to produce a more similar content as produced in the microscopic reality. A validation of these images by biological experts could augment the original dataset and allow their analysis by Deep-based solutions.",Measurement;Deep learning;Image segmentation;Microscopy;Modulation;Stem cells;Generative adversarial networks;AAEGAN;noise injection;image generation;brain organoids;background modulation,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 Eleventh International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)",10.1109/IPTA54936.2022.9784149
Classification of Breast Cancer Histopathological Images using DensNet201,"Diagnosing and classifying breast cancer tumors is a rather complex activity for pathologists due to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor cells. The wide use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of Deep Learning (DL) have led to promising results in terms of breast histopathology images classification. The outcomes depend largely on two main factors, namely, the number and quality of images. BreaKhis dataset shows an imbalance in the image classes distribution, thus generating the performance degradation of the classifier model due to a biased classification towards the majority class. In this paper, a Deep Convolution Generative Adversial Network (DCGAN) is applied to give the number of images consistence in the minority (benign) class with that of the majority (malignant) class. Data augmentation is a technique used later to create more data from the limited ones. The DenseNet201 pre-trained model is chosen and used with the concatenation of features from various DensNet blocks. Instead of considering all the layers of the pre-trained network, the features are extracted from the lower layers of DensNet201, via a global average pooling (GAP). These features are passed to the softmax classifier to classify breast cancer. The model is evaluated using a two-class BreaKhis, provided at four magnification levels 40x, 100x, 200x, and 400x. The proposed method yielded test accuracies of 96%, 95%, 88%, and 92% respectively for each magnification factor. As indicated in the results, the proposed method based on data augmentation by DCGAN and feature concatenation using DenseNet201 pre-trained models could produce an efficient prediction for breast cancer image classification.",Deep learning;Degradation;Histopathology;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Data models;deep learning;breast cancer;classification;DCGAN;transfer learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 7th International Conference on Image and Signal Processing and their Applications (ISPA),10.1109/ISPA54004.2022.9786028
Toward Robust Histology-Prior Embedding for Endomicroscopy Image Classification,"Representation learning is the critical task for medical image analysis in computer-aided diagnosis. However, it is challenging to learn discriminative features due to the limited size of the dataset and the lack of labels. In this paper, we propose a stochastic routing normalization and neighborhood embedding framework with application to breast tissue classification by learning discriminative features of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy. In order to align the low-level and mid-level of pCLE and histology domain, we firstly build the domain-specific normalization module with stochastic activation strategy considering both depth-wise and feature-wise criterion. For high-level features, the latent centers are learned from the histology domain as the template for feature matching. The proposed method is evaluated on a clinical database with 700 pCLE mosaics. The accuracy of image classification with limited training samples demonstrates that the proposed method can outperform previous works on domain alignment.",Histopathology;Endomicroscopy;Feature extraction;Cancer;Medical diagnostic imaging;Imaging;Training;Endomicroscopy imaging;stochastic feature embedding;representation learning,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2022.3180340
Semi-Supervised Learning with GANs for Melanoma Detection,"Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that can be curable if caught early. Typically, the diagnosis involves a basic skin examination. In case of need, biopsy and histopathological examination are also performed. In addition to reducing a dermatologist's workload, computer-aided diagnosis provides an independent score regardless of a clinician's experience. The effectiveness of deep-learning-based methods has increased melodramatically over the past decade, and they are outperforming traditional image-processing methods in segmentation tasks. But, this type of learning approach has the main drawback, namely, it requires a large number of labeled samples per class for training. However, a new technique may ameliorate this constraint. To automate the learning process of feature representation of melanoma samples in a semi-supervised manner, this research work proposes Deep Convolution Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). In extensive experiments, the proposed feature learning method proves effective. Although some work on this had been done before, the proposed method works better than others in terms of training time and performance. With only 200 labeled images, it achieved precision, accuracy, and recall scores of 0.7689, 0.7525, and 0.7384. Additionally, the proposed method can generate real-world dermoscopy images.",Training;Support vector machines;Representation learning;Image segmentation;Convolution;Melanoma;Semisupervised learning;DCGAN(Deep Convolution Generative Neural Network);Melanoma;Dermoscopy;Malignant;Benign;SVM(Support Vector Machine),INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 6th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS),10.1109/ICICCS53718.2022.9787990
Detection of Leukemia using Machine Learning,"Leukemia is a type of cancer which damages the blood-forming tissues that produces rbc's, wbc's and blood platelets, which is present inside bone marrow. Leukemia is the cancer that mainly occurs within blood forming tissues in the human body. It may slowly affect all the organs inside the body without any external indication leading to several other disorders. The diagnosis of leukemia in early stages of the disease is difficult as the current technologies are more time cons uming. Studies suggest that India ranks 3rd highest in reported cases of Blood Cancer, after USA and China. If a person is already diagnosed with any one among other types of cancer, then the chances of developing leukemia is nearly 30%. The symptoms of leukemia are tiredness, flu, fatigue and weight loss which makes it very difficult to predict manually by clinical methods. Since it is malignant and fatal it is neces s ary that it mus t be predicted earlier in order to undergo sufficient treatment and thereby saving millions of lives. As compared to all other types cancers, leukemia cases have been increasing dramatically in the entire world. Since the symptoms of leukemia are being very common, people fail to detect it in the early stage. The main objective of our project is to diagnose leukemia in the primary stage by analysing peripheral blood smear images and thus treatment could be given in specific and successful way. Thus our project focusses on using the best machine learning algorithms for detecting leukemia in a very early stage. This res earch study collects peripheral blood smear images (PBS), which are microscopic images of the blood samples. The images collected are preprocessed and then segmentation is performed where the images are segmented based on pixels and enlarged portion of affected area of the blood s ample image is us ed for feature extraction process. Finally classification is done using CNN in order to detect leukemia.",Image segmentation;Machine learning algorithms;Microscopy;Sociology;Neural networks;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Leukemia;Bone marrow;Peripheral Blood Smear;Segmentation;Convolutional Neural Networks,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 International Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence and Computing (ICAAIC),10.1109/ICAAIC53929.2022.9792725
A Novel Ensemble Strategy With Enhanced Cross Attention Encoder-Decoder Framework for Tumor Segmentation in Whole Slide Images,"Due to the rapid increase in the quality of the generated medical images combined with the development of computational algorithms, Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems, which are empowered with artificial intelligence to analyze these images, provide an objective decision to assist and guide the medical staff. In cancer diagnosis and staging, the golden standard is the microscopic examination of suspicious tissue either in the laboratory using the conventional glass slides or using their digital scanned counterparts called Whole Slide Images (WSI). However, the vast search space in these slides and the existing heterogeneous patterns in the sampled tissue make their analysis process labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel encoder-decoder framework with a new ensemble strategy to address the difficulties in semantically segmenting tumors in WSI. We introduced new enhancements to the base U-Net, including cross attention to aggregate information from different portions of the network. Moreover, we manipulated each stained slide to produce three new slides with different characteristics and fed them to separate models and injected their predictions together at the inference stage through our proposed ensemble strategy to form the final segmentation prediction. We tested and validated the proposed cross attention U-Net model with the ensemble strategy on the task of viable tumor segmentation of the challenging hepatocellular carcinoma in liver WSIs in the PAIP2019 dataset. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed ensemble strategy outperformed the single conventional handling of the WSI and improved the segmentation accuracy.",Image segmentation;Solid modeling;Microscopy;Liver;Predictive models;Task analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Whole-Slide Images;Medical Image Segmentation;PAIP2019;Ensemble Strategy;Computer-Aided Diagnosis,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 13th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems (ICICS),10.1109/ICICS55353.2022.9811163
Nuclei Segmentation in Breast Histopathology Images using FCM,"Recently, computerized methods have been rapidly evolving in the area of digital pathology, with growing applications related to nuclei detection. Cell nuclei segmentation is a fundamental yet crucial step in pleomorphism detection based on the Nottingham Histopathology Grading (NHG) system. The information of the segmented nuclei such as size and morphology properties can be used to determine the scoring decision of the breast histopathology images in terms of pleomorphism. The main purpose of this project is to segment the cell nuclei using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained breast histopathology images. In this paper, noise removal associated with Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) clustering algorithm is introduced which can extract information about each object and then revised and eliminate those irrelevant regions. The RGB input images would be first pre-processed to normalize the color of the input images. The color normalization stage is essential to facilitate the segmentation stage in the later step. For the segmentation process, FCM clustering techniques are applied to better allocate similar pixels into the same clustering while having significant differences between each cluster. Next, the noise region reduction method is performed to discard those pixels which are not related to the properties of cell nuclei. The proposed method is measured by Performance Matrix and the experimental result shows that it demonstrates more desirable performance than the convention FCM clustering method which has average accuracy of 77.30% (±3.332).",Image segmentation;Histopathology;Image color analysis;Clustering algorithms;Morphology;Breast;Filtering algorithms;Nuclei Segmentation;Breast cancer;Segmentation;FCM;Histopathology,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems (I2CACIS),10.1109/I2CACIS54679.2022.9815480
Automatic Defect Detection in Epitaxial Layers by Micro Photoluminescence Imaging,"The early in-line detection of defects is a fundamental step in semiconductor manufacturing to ensure the device quality. Inspection techniques currently available can effectively detect large epitaxial defects causing morphological surface variations like stacking faults, while dislocations go undetected. Herein we introduce a new technology with enhanced machine learning analysis, based on contactless and non-destructive room temperature micro-photoluminescence imaging (micro-PL), for the detection and classification of defects in silicon epitaxial layers. With laboratory microscopy techniques we investigate the correspondence between different defect morphologies in micro-PL images and extended crystallographic defects. A good matching in terms of defect density is found between automatic micro-PL analysis and the standard laboratory analysis in an interval spanning from few defects/cm2 up to 105 defects/cm2.",Epitaxial growth;Epitaxial layers;Imaging;Silicon;Artificial neural networks;Surface morphology;Shape;Photoluminescence;silicon epitaxial layers;crystal defects;artificial neural networks;image segmentation,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,10.1109/TSM.2022.3189847
Laser soldered wire bonding on liquid printed and sputtered contact structures on thin-flexes and injection molded devices,"Traditional methods of wire bonding do not work well on liquid printed contact layers and soft substrate materials. Laser soldered wire bonding i.e., SB2-WB constitutes a novel approach to this problem as it works without the need for high pressures, temperatures or vibration [1].In this work we qualify different conductive layers of printed, plated, and vapor coated materials containing Au, Cu and Ag with regard to their suitability for forming a stable and reliable interface with a SAC_305 laser jetted solder bump, which is the basis for the laser soldered wire bonding process (SB2-WB). As printing technologies, we have chosen stencil- and screen-printing, alternatively gold was deposited by sputtering and patterned by subsequent lithography and wet-chemical etching. As substrates, we selected Polyethylene-naphthalate (PET) Teonex Q51, Parylene and Glass. Au wire and Ag ribbons were used for forming the wire bonds. Investigations on printed layers have been focused on correlation between paste receipt, printing technology related layer thickness, paste-related post-treatment and compatibility to laser assisted solder ball bumping i.e., SB2-Jet.Using a shear-tester, the mechanical load-capacity of the formed solder joints was measured, and the corresponding fracture modes were inspected using an optical microscope. The characteristic of the interfacial layers, material bulk textures and other metallurgical properties was analysed using SEM-FIB, EDX, X-ray and optical microscopy.Moreover, we demonstrated the forming of laser soldered wire bonds on two demonstrators showing different pad metallization, contact form and substrate bulk material.Finally, the future prospects of intended feasibility studies for laser soldered wire bonding, with structures consisting of paste and ink are highlighted.",Printing;Gold;Optical microscopy;Semiconductor lasers;Wires;X-ray lasers;Laser stability;wire-bonding;wire-soldering;molded device;ink;paste;printing;screen-printing;jetting;laser-reflow;nano;flex;film,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE 72nd Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC),10.1109/ECTC51906.2022.00229
Unsupervised Representation Learning for Tissue Segmentation in Histopathological Images: From Global to Local Contrast,"Tissue segmentation is an essential task in computational pathology. However, relevant datasets for such a pixel-level classification task are hard to obtain due to the difficulty of annotation, bringing obstacles for training a deep learning-based segmentation model. Recently, contrastive learning has provided a feasible solution for mitigating the heavy reliance of deep learning models on annotation. Nevertheless, applying contrastive loss to the most abstract image representations, existing contrastive learning frameworks focus on global features, therefore, are less capable of encoding finer-grained features (e.g., pixel-level discrimination) for the tissue segmentation task. Enlightened by domain knowledge, we design three contrastive learning tasks with multi-granularity views (from global to local) for encoding necessary features into representations without accessing annotations. Specifically, we construct: (1) an image-level task to capture the difference between tissue components, i.e., encoding the component discrimination; (2) a superpixel-level task to learn discriminative representations of local regions with different tissue components, i.e., encoding the prototype discrimination; (3) a pixel-level task to encourage similar representations of different tissue components within a local region, i.e., encoding the spatial smoothness. Through our global-to-local pre-training strategy, the learned representations can reasonably capture the domain-specific and fine-grained patterns, making them easily transferable to various tissue segmentation tasks in histopathological images. We conduct extensive experiments on two tissue segmentation datasets, while considering two real-world scenarios with limited or sparse annotations. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework is superior to existing contrastive learning methods and can be easily combined with weakly supervised and semi-supervised segmentation methods.",Task analysis;Image segmentation;Annotations;Decoding;Tumors;Representation learning;Cancer;Contrastive learning;tissue segmentation;histopathological image;superpixel,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2022.3191398
Design and Control Over Morphology of Pseudopeptidic Bottlebrush Polymer/Liquid Crystal Composites,"Polymer liquid crystal composites (PLCCs) with controlled microstructures have several applications in nanotechnology and biology. We, herein, present the design, fabrication, and morphology of pseudopeptidic bottlebrush polymer and nematic liquid crystal composites. An array of extendable submicron to micron size architectures, viz., porous networks, spheres, particles, aggregates, and vesicles is generated from PLCC by appropriately modulating the concentration of polymer, liquid crystal (LC), and solvent in the composite. In addition, the formation of vesicular architectures is monitored with the variation of LC and polymer concentration. The average vesicles size grows from ~250 nm to ~1 µm as the LC concentration increases. The effective loading of LC in the vesicle core is further validated by Raman mapping. Various ultramicroscopic methods such as polarizing optical microscopy (POM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are used to characterize the different microstructures.

Detection of Cells and Microbes in Microscopic Field Based on Improved YOLOv5,"The detection of cell and microbes under the microscope is of great value in both clinical experiments and experimental teaching. However, the narrow field of view of conventional light microscopes and the problem of cell or microbial stacking make target detection a challenging task. In this paper, the YOLOv5 target detection method is improved through the attention mechanism, so that it can realize the target detection of cells and microorganisms. The Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module is added to the YOLOv5 model to extract key features, and we also replace the Path Aggregation Network (PANet) of YOLOv5 with Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) for fast multi-scale feature fusion. The average precision (AP@0.5) of the improved algorithm in this paper is 81.98% under the cell and microbe microscopy datasets, which is 1.95% higher than the YOLOv5s model.

Cervical Cancer Cell Segmentation and Classification using ML Approach,"In the current era, the developers are focusing on the adequacy of Ensemble Learning (EL) and Transfer Learning (TL) techniques in the field of cervical histopathology photograph determination.

In addition, we’ve created Xception, Inception-V3, Resnet-50 and VCG-16 models in the setup. At that factor, to support the order of execution, a weighted EL method is presented. From that factor onward, to proceed with the proposed calculation, a dataset comprising of around 500 photos, recolored through 3 immunohistochemistry techniques (Vascular endothelial growth factor-VEGF, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-HIF and Aquaporins-AQP) is used. On testing, we gather the maximum accuracy over 97.03% and 98.61% on recoloring AQP pictures and recoloring VEGF pictures, separately.

Gold nanolabels for SERS imaging excitable by red lasers,"Optical labels excitable by red lasers are promising for the diagnostics and treatment of certain types of cancer as the lasers with a wavelength from the range of 630–660 nm are considered relatively safe and effectively penetrate into tissues on a depth up to 5 mm. Such optical labels can be used quite effectively in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging. The goal of present work consists in the design of plasmonic labels, which give intense signal under red light excitation, their characterization and probing on live cells. Gold nanostars (NS) were synthesized by a single-stage method to be used as a metal core and were studied by scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy which confirmed their morphology and showed the maximum of absorption band in the middle of red region. NS further were coated with a multilayer polymer shell with incorporated cyanine 5.5 dye. Folic acid was introduced as a model delivery vector. The pronounce SERS spectra of obtained labels were registered in solution phase. The further study of labels incubated with PANC-1 cell line showed the SERS response at focus on the cell cytoplasm. The MTT assay revealed that the labels don't have a toxic effect in the concentration range of 0.05 to 1 mg/l for atomic gold on the same cell line.

Hybrid Feature Set based Mitotic Detection in Breast Histopathology Images,"Breast cancer is a very serious threat to women and requires faster diagnosis methods to decrease the mortality rates. Automatic detection of mitosis is very difficult when compared to other pattern detection since mitotic cells are irregularly shaped objects, therefore there is no simple way of extracting features of a mitotic cell. This paper proposes a novel method with which a dataset comprising of shape and texture features are created from the image patches extracted from whole-slide histopathology images (MITOS-ATYPIA-14). The extracted image patches are converted to blue ratio images and hysteresis thresholding is applied for better edge detection. The ROI is extracted and a set of 10 shape features and 34 texture features are then extracted from each segmented image to form a hybrid feature dataset. Correlation-based feature selection is used to obtain the dominant features which can classify the data points as mitotic and non-mitotic. The dataset is then used to train seven models and classification is performed on unannotated image patches and the best model is selected based on the accuracy.",Training;Image segmentation;Histopathology;Shape;Image edge detection;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Breast Histopathology;grey level co-occurrence matrix;whole slide imaging;correlation-based feature selection,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT),10.1109/ICICT54344.2022.9850552
A Novel Low Rank Smooth Flat-Field Correction Algorithm for Hyperspectral Microscopy Imaging,"A flat-field correction method is proposed for multiple measured hyperspectral microscopy imaging in this paper. As the most crucial preprocessing process in quantitative microscopic analysis, flat-field correction solves the uneven illumination caused by vignetting in microscopic images, and guarantees the precision of spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral microscopic imaging. In order to carry out flat-field correction and extract uneven illumination among groups of hyperspectral microscopic data containing hundreds of bands simultaneously, two properties of vignetting have been exploited: i) low-rank property is reflected by little information contained in vignetting; ii) local smoothness can be observed as a gradual change in brightness of vignetting, which is typically equivalent to the sparseness in spatial frequency domain. Combining the two properties above, a novel Low Rank Smooth Flat-field Correction (LRSFC) model modified from common orthogonal basis extraction is proposed, while an optimization is solved based on alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM), obtaining a unique flat-field term with low-rank and smooth properties. Qualitative and quantitative experimental assessments indicate that LRSFC does not add extra cell texture to the extracted flat-field term, whose performance appears prior to other state-of-the-art flat-field correction methods.",Microscopy;Hyperspectral imaging;Imaging;Pathology;Optical microscopy;Optical imaging;Adaptive optics;Alternating direction multiplier method;common and individual feature extraction;flat-field correction;hyperspectral microscopy imaging;vignetting,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2022.3198946
A Scalable Graph-Based Framework for Multi-Organ Histology Image Classification,"Graph-based approaches are successful for histology image classification tasks but still face many challenges, such as: 1) the lack of nuclei-level labels and the significant variations between histology images make it extremely difficult to extract discriminative high-level nuclei features like nuclei type, texture and micro-environment; 2) graph-based approaches cannot handle large-scale cell graph nodes typically contained in histology images; and 3) graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to learn the long-range dependency of cell graphs. To address the above challenges, we propose a scalable graph-based framework for multi-organ histology image classification. We develop a two-step masked nuclei patches supervised training approach to extract discriminative high-level nuclei features for histology images without nuclei-level labels. Additionally, we introduce a nuclei sampling strategy to make our graph-based framework scalable for large-scale cell graphs. Furthermore, we propose HierArchical Transformer Graph Neural Network (HAT-Net+) for cell graph classi- fications. HAT-Net+ adopts Transformer to model the long-range dependency of cell graphs and a parameter-free approach to adaptively fuse different hierarchical graph representations of each layer. We achieved the state-of-the-art results on four public histology image classification datasets: CRC dataset (100%), Extended CRC dataset (98%), UZH dataset (96.9%) and BACH dataset (88%). Unlike other methods, our approach can be used in various histology image classification tasks, even for images without nuclei-level labels, indicating its potential in cancer diagnosis.

A semi-automatic approach for quantitative analysis of histological images,"The use of a computational approach in histological analysis can help in the acquisition and interpretation of results. In this work, we present a computational method to automate the morphometrical protocol proposed by Ewald R. Weibel in 1966. The method proposed here was based on the use of widely known image processing algorithms aiming to identify regions of interest (i.e. image segmentation, thresholding and flood fill). The method also uses mathematical morphology, such as the opening operator to filter the noise left by the thresholding. As a contribution of this work, we also created a software tool, named AutoGrid, to support reasearchers of biology labs apply the method. The proposal was evaluated on a set of images taken from rat prostate. In this scenario, we extracted data to perform histological analysis both using the software tool and following the manual protocol. When the tool was used (i.e. semi-automatic mode), the user was asked to perform a little manual intervention, and the most time consuming and tiring parts of the process runs automatically. Finally, the computational approach presented a faster (i.e. $\approx$45% less time) and less monotonous histological analysis, with statistically equivalent results to those obtained on the manual mode.",Image segmentation;Thresholding (Imaging);Protocols;Statistical analysis;Software algorithms;Morphology;Manuals;Weibel’s Grid;Biological tissue segmentation;Mathematical Morphology,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 29th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing (IWSSIP)",10.1109/IWSSIP55020.2022.9854422
Classification of H&E images exploring ensemble learning with two-stage feature selection,"In this work, an investigation based on ensemble learning is presented for the recognition of patterns in histological tissues stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, representative of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, liver tissues and oral dysplasia. The strategy considered compositions with multiple descriptors, such as deep learned and handcrafted, and multiple classifiers. The deep learned descriptors were calculated by exploring different architectures of convolutional neural networks. The handcrafted descriptors were representative of the multidimensional and multiscale fractal categories, Haralick and local binary pattern. The main combinations were obtained through two-stage feature selection (ranking with wrapper selection) and classified via an ensemble composed of five classifiers. The accuracy rates were values between 93.10% and 100%, with some highlights involving the main combinations of approaches.",Learning systems;Metaheuristics;Liver;Imaging;Feature extraction;Fractals;Breast cancer;histological images;ensemble learning;feature selection;ranking with metaheuristics,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 29th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing (IWSSIP)",10.1109/IWSSIP55020.2022.9854418
Ensemble CAD System for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Classification,"Acute Lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of blood cancer which affects white blood cells (WBC) and can cause damage to bone marrow. This disease is diagnosed with a complete blood count (CBC) and a bone marrow aspiration, and it can be lethal if not caught early. In general, manual procedures such as microscopic inspection of stained sample slides are employed to diagnose leukemia. However, manual methods are time-consuming, less accurate, and might result in errors due to numerous human variables such as stress and exhaustion. So, this study discusses the methodology of computer-aided diagnosis systems, including enhancement, augmentation, ensemble, feature extraction, and the usage of CNN-based methods. In proposed method, two classes (Healthy/infected) are discretized using the ALL- IDB-2 dataset, which provided segmented microscopic images.

Color Space-based HoVer-Net for Nuclei Instance Segmentation and Classification,"Nuclei segmentation and classification is a crucial step utilized throughout various microscopy medical analysis applications. However, it has several challenges such as the segmentation of small objects, highly imbalanced data, and subtle differences between types of nuclei. In this paper, we propose a method to tackle the aforementioned problems. First, a new encoder “ConvNeXt” is proposed for the HoVer-Net architecture to leverage the major components of vision transformer to improve the network's encoding capabilities. Second, to better distinguish the differences between nuclei, a multi-channel color space-based approach is proposed to aid the model in extracting discriminative features. Third, affine transformations such as scaling and shearing are utilized to improve the model's gen-eralizability. Finally, Unified Focal Loss (UFL) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) are tested in attempt to tackle the foreground-backward imbalance and further improve gen-eralizability, respectively. We show how our proposed method (ConvNeXt-S encoder + affine transformation + multi-channel color stacking) outperforms the original HoVer-Net network on the “Lizard” dataset by 2.6% mPQ+.",Visualization;Image color analysis;Microscopy;Stacking;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Transformers;nuclei segmentation;nuclei classification;imbal-ance;color space,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging Challenges (ISBIC),10.1109/ISBIC56247.2022.9854725
HistoSeg: Quick attention with multi-loss function for multi-structure segmentation in digital histology images,"Medical image segmentation assists in computeraided diagnosis, surgeries, and treatment. Digitize tissue slide images are used to analyze and segment glands, nuclei, and other biomarkers which are further used in computer-aided medical applications. To this end, many researchers developed different neural networks to perform segmentation on histological images, mostly these networks are based on encoder-decoder architecture and also utilize complex attention modules or transformers. However, these networks are less accurate to capture relevant local and global features with accurate boundary detection at multiple scales, therefore, we proposed an Encoder-Decoder Network, Quick Attention Module and a Multi Loss Function (combination of Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) Loss, Focal Loss Dice Loss). We evaluate the generalization capability of our proposed network on two publicly available datasets for medical image segmentation MoNuSeg and GlaS and outperform the state-of-the-art networks with 1.99% improvement on the MoNuSeg dataset and 7.15% improvement on the GlaS dataset.

Finger Joint Angle Estimation With Visual Attention for Rehabilitation Support: A Case Study of the Chopsticks Manipulation Test,"Most East Asian rehabilitation centers offer chopsticks manipulation tests (CMT). In addition to impaired hand function, approximately two-thirds of stroke survivors have visual impairment related to eye movement. This article investigates the significance of combining finger joint angle estimation and a visual attention measurement in CMT. We present a multiscopic framework that consists of microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels. We develop a feature extraction technique to build the finger kinematic model at the microscopic level. At the mesoscopic level, we propose an active perception ability to detect the position and geometry of the finger on the chopsticks. The proposed framework estimates the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint angle on the index finger during CMT using fully connected cascade neural networks (FCC-NN). At the macroscopic level, we implement a cognitive ability by measuring visual attention during CMT. We further evaluate the proposed framework with a conventional test that counts the number of peanuts (NP) which are moved from one bowl to another using chopsticks within a particular time frame. We introduce three evaluation indices, namely joint angle estimation movement (JAEM), chopstick attention movement (CAM), and chopstick tip movement (CTM), by detecting the local minima and maxima of the time series data. According to the experiment results, the velocity of these three evaluation indices could indicate improvement in hand and eye function during CMT.

Knowledge-Based Representation Learning for Nucleus Instance Classification From Histopathological Images,"The classification of nuclei in H&E-stained histopathological images is a fundamental step in the quantitative analysis of digital pathology. Most existing methods employ multi-class classification on the detected nucleus instances, while the annotation scale greatly limits their performance. Moreover, they often downplay the contextual information surrounding nucleus instances that is critical for classification. To explicitly provide contextual information to the classification model, we design a new structured input consisting of a content-rich image patch and a target instance mask. The image patch provides rich contextual information, while the target instance mask indicates the location of the instance to be classified and emphasizes its shape. Benefiting from our structured input format, we propose Structured Triplet for representation learning, a triplet learning framework on unlabelled nucleus instances with customized positive and negative sampling strategies. We pre-train a feature extraction model based on this framework with a large-scale unlabeled dataset, making it possible to train an effective classification model with limited annotated data. We also add two auxiliary branches, namely the attribute learning branch and the conventional self-supervised learning branch, to further improve its performance. As part of this work, we will release a new dataset of H&E-stained pathology images with nucleus instance masks, containing 20,187 patches of size 1024  $\times1024$ , where each patch comes from a different whole-slide image. The model pre-trained on this dataset with our framework significantly reduces the burden of extensive labeling. We show a substantial improvement in nucleus classification accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",Pathology;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Data models;Representation learning;Labeling;Annotations;Triplet learning;nucleus classification;domain knowledge;digital pathology,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2022.3201981
Improving Brain Tumor Multiclass Classification With Semantic Features,"Histopathological examination of biopsy tissues is still utilized to diagnose and classify brain cancers today. The current approach is inconvenient, time-consuming, and prone to human mistake. These disadvantages emphasize the significance of establishing a fully automated deep learning-based system for classifying brain tumors. In this paper, we suggest an approach to improve the classification for four types of brain tumors by providing the classifier with segmentation as semantic features. 1,452 multi model magnetic resonance images from the Siberian Brain Tumor Dataset (SBT) are used for training, validation, and testing. The training and validation are implemented with our experimental simple convolutional neural network and a pre-trained VGG16. Best performed models are selected and tested on both SBT and the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2020 dataset (BraTS). The models with segmentation outperform all models without segmentation on the same dataset. We also found that, compare to a general purposed network such as VGG16, a simple convolutional neural network trained on a specific task have better generalization when tested with a public dataset.",Training;Image segmentation;Semantics;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Reliability;Task analysis;brain tumor classification;deep learning;biomedical images processing;convolutional neural networks,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 Ural-Siberian Conference on Computational Technologies in Cognitive Science, Genomics and Biomedicine (CSGB)",10.1109/CSGB56354.2022.9865366
Breast Cancer Diagnosis from Histopathology Images using Supervised Algorithms,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer type worldwide. In cancer studies, histopathological breast images are used in the process of diagnosis. In this paper, we defined three sets of features to represent the characteristics of the cell nuclei to detect malignant cases. Geometric, directional, and intensity-based features, a total of 33, are derived and evaluated using breast cancer histopathological images from the BreaKHis database. Four machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Narrow Neural Networks (NNN), are designed to assess the efficiency of the sets. The preliminary results showed that the proposed methodology achieved high performance in classifying cancerous cells as the directional feature set was the most effective set among the three sets. The combination of the sets achieved the best performance by the NNN, which reached an accuracy, recall, precision, AUC, and F1 score of 96.9%, 97.4%, 98%, 98.8%, and 97.7%, respectively.",Support vector machines;Measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Histopathology;Shape;Artificial neural networks;Feature extraction;histopathology image;breast cancer;diagnosis;supervised algorithms,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE 35th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS),10.1109/CBMS55023.2022.00025
Identification of the Tumor Boundary of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma Based on Multiphoton Microscopy,"Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor of the biliary system. The structural characteristics of the bile duct tissue can reflect the changes in its function. The visualization of these specific features is of special significance for understanding the degree of invasion of HCC and tumor borders. Radical R0 resection is the only cure for HCC. Currently, the commonly used medical imaging diagnostic methods can only provide a rough tumor range and require a histopathological analysis. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) not only has an ultra-high spatial resolution but is also extremely sensitive to collagen fibers with noncentrosymmetric structures. In this study, MPM is applied to image the boundaries of HCC tumors. First, the experimental results show that MPM can clearly reveal the existence of residual cancer cells at the surgical margin. Second, the density of the collagen fibers and the dispersion of the 2D direction angle of the collagen fibers of normal and cancerous tissues are further calculated quantitatively. The collagen fiber signals before and after cancer cell invasion into the different tissues are found to be different. Finally, through a logistic regression prediction curve, combined with the collagen fiber density and 2D direction angle as indicators, it is further judged whether the resection margin is negative, which is closely related to the prognosis of HCC. The experimental results indicate that MPM imaging can serve as a new tool for diagnosing whether the HCC tumor boundary reaches R0 resection.",Tumors;Cancer;Ducts;Imaging;Muscles;Optical fiber dispersion;Microscopy;Multiphoton microscopy;hilar cholangiocarci- noma;tumor boundary;collagen,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Photonics Journal,10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3203511
Segmentation with Residual Attention U-Net and an Edge-Enhancement Approach Preserves Cell Shape Features,"The ability to extrapolate gene expression dynamics in living single cells requires robust cell segmentation, and one of the challenges is the amorphous or irregularly shaped cell boundaries. To address this issue, we modified the U-Net architecture to segment cells in fluorescence widefield microscopy images and quantitatively evaluated its performance. We also proposed a novel loss function approach that emphasizes the segmentation accuracy on cell boundaries and encourages shape feature preservation. With a 97% sensitivity, 93% specificity, 91% Jaccard similarity, and 95% Dice coefficient, our proposed method called Residual Attention U-Net with edge-enhancement surpassed the state-of-the-art U-Net in segmentation performance as evaluated by the traditional metrics. More remarkably, the same proposed candidate also performed the best in terms of the preservation of valuable shape features, namely area, eccentricity, major axis length, solidity and orientation. These improvements on shape feature preservation can serve as useful assets for downstream cell tracking and quantification of changes in cell statistics or features over time.",Image segmentation;Sensitivity;Shape;Microscopy;Image edge detection;Computer architecture;Cells (biology),INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 44th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871026
Whole Slide Image Multi-Classification of Cervical Epithelial Lesions Based on Unsupervised Pre-training,"Cervical cancer has become one of the important factors threatening women's health. Histopathological diagnosis is the most important criterion for cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment. Accurate classification of lesion degree of cervical epithelium by analyzing whole slide images (WSIs) can effectively improve the therapeutic effect and prognosis. However, classification of cervical lesion degree shows poor reproductivity due to lack of standardisation and is subjective among clinicians. In addition, due to the lack of large-scale finely annotated datasets, current deep learning methods do not perform well on this task. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method based on unsupervised pre-training to solve this multi-classification task. Our method first applied a patch-level network to predict the patch-level score and generate a heatmap that can highlight the lesion area. This network is pre-trained using an unsupervised method and verified on a public dataset. Then without extracting manual features, heatmaps are fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) model directly for the WSI-level prediction. Our approach achieved an accuracy of 81.19% and a custom metric score of 0.9495 on the public cervical cancer WSI dataset, which is the highest in the public so far.",Measurement;Heating systems;Manuals;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Lesions;Convolutional neural networks,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 44th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871149

EA-UNet: A Macrophages Image Segmentation Model Based on U-Net with External Attention,"When people are exposed to air pollution for a long time, inhaling pollution particles can cause systemic diseases. Studies have shown that carbon content in Airway Macrophages (CCAM) can be used to evaluate particulate matter exposure. The automatic detection of macrophages from electron microscopy is an essential prerequisite for researchers to study the exposure of fine particles in macrophages. However, at present, the mainstream medical image segmentation algorithms are more aimed at the CT images of the lungs or brains with relatively fixed shapes, and the segmentation performance of macrophages with uncertain shapes and sizes is inaccurate. Segmentation of macrophages faces several challenges, including the high similarity of cell images leading to false detection and missed detection, and blurred boundaries in the segmentation of macrophages. Further, no public macrophage segmentation datasets are available for deep model training. To address these challenges, we propose a Macrophage Segmentation Network that combines the U-Net convolutional network as the structure of the main body network with the attention mechanism to automatically identify macrophages from induced sputum microscopy images. In our network, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate diverse scale features from U-Net encoder to incorporate fine-grained details with coarse-grained semantics from diverse scale features. Then, the external-attention module tokenizes image patches from the multi-scale feature map as the input sequence for extracting global contexts which focus on regions of interest to obtain more accurate segmentation results and solve the disadvantage of insufficient data. Experiments on our MASEG dataset demonstrate that the EA-UNet proposed in this paper has higher segmentation accuracy than other state-of-art segmentation methods.",Training;Image segmentation;Adaptation models;Shape;Semantics;Semisupervised learning;Feature extraction;medical image segmentation;U-Net;macrophages;external-attention,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 7th International Conference on Image, Vision and Computing (ICIVC)",10.1109/ICIVC55077.2022.9886758
Cross-patch Dense Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Segmentation of Cellular Nuclei in Histopathologic Images,"We study the semi-supervised learning problem, using a few labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train the network, by developing a cross-patch dense contrastive learning framework, to segment cellular nuclei in histopathologic images. This task is motivated by the expensive burden on collecting labeled data for histopathologic image segmentation tasks. The key idea of our method is to align features of teacher and student networks, sampled from cross-image in both patch- and pixel-levels, for enforcing the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of features that as we shown is helpful for extracting valuable knowledge from unlabeled data. We also design a novel optimization framework that combines consistency regularization and entropy minimization techniques, showing good property in eviction of gradient vanishing. We assess the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, and obtain positive results on extensive experiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

DTFD-MIL: Double-Tier Feature Distillation Multiple Instance Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Classification,"Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been increasingly used in the classification of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). However, MIL approaches for this specific classification problem still face unique challenges, particularly those related to small sample cohorts. In these, there are limited number of WSI slides (bags), while the resolution of a single WSI is huge, which leads to a large number of patches (instances) cropped from this slide. To address this issue, we propose to virtually enlarge the number of bags by introducing the concept of pseudo-bags, on which a double-tier MIL framework is built to effectively use the intrinsic features. Besides, we also contribute to deriving the instance probability under the framework of attentionbased MIL, and utilize the derivation to help construct and analyze the proposed framework. The proposed method outperforms other latest methods on the CAMELYON-16 by substantially large margins, and is also better in performance on the TCGA lung cancer dataset.

NormToRaw: A Style Transfer Based Self-supervised Learning Approach for Nuclei Segmentation,"Nuclei segmentation is valuable in histopathological image analysis, but labeling nuclei is costly. Different organs, pa-tients and diseases will lead to high variability in the morphology of nuclei, the structure of tissues, etc., which is difficult to elim-inate. Inconsistent staining operations and scanning operations will cause variability in histopathological image style. Relying on a small amount of labeled data, it is hard for the model to adapt to the high variability among histopathological images. Therefore, it is necessary to exploit the value in the massive unlabeled data. However, because the existing pretext tasks in self-supervised learning do not well consider the characteristics of histopathological images and segmentation task, the same for the existing data augmentation approaches in contrastive learning, they are not suitable for nuclei segmentation. In this paper, the proposed method, named NormToRaw, takes into consideration the characteristics of nuclei segmentation, which can learn semantic information from different stains by style transfer. A generative adversarial network is used to transfer the normalized image to the raw image. Pre-trained on more than 8,000 unlabeled images and trained on 16 labeled images, the experimental results of 5 pre-trained models showed that the proposed method is effective for improving the performance of nuclei segmentation.",Image segmentation;Image analysis;Semantics;Neural networks;Morphology;Self-supervised learning;Generative adversarial networks;Nuclei Segmentation;Histopathological Image;Self-supervised Learning;Style Transfer;Generative Adversarial Network,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892957
A usability study of an innovative optical device for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis in Nigeria,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that is predominantly diagnosed by conventional microscopy in SubSaharan Africa. However, effective diagnosis by conventional microscopy is limited by multiple technical and logistic barriers. Alternative diagnostic techniques are needed. The Schistoscope is a digital optical device that has been designed to support microscopists for the detection of schistosomiasis in endemic resource-limited settings.

Surface Defect Detection based on Improved YOLOv3-Tiny Algorithm,"To take into account both accuracy and real-time performance in surface defect detection, we propose a new surface defect detection algorithm based on YOLOv3-Tiny. The algorithm first adds a YOLO layer that fuses shallow and deep features on the basis of YOLOv3-Tiny, to enhance the capabilities of microscopic defect detection through multi-scale features fusion. And the hybrid attention mechanism module, named SE-C, is employed before every YOLO layer. The SE-C module can decrease the weight of irrelevant background's features while improving the weight of the defect's features, it will improve the algorithm's robustness and accuracy. Finally, the algorithm re-clusters the anchor boxes based on K-means in each dataset. The experimental results reveal the improved algorithm has a good trade-off between the accuracy and the speed of defect detection, especially in easily confused background. More importantly, the algorithm can also be applied to other object detection on similar scenes.",Industries;Fuses;Microscopy;Object detection;Feature extraction;Robustness;Real-time systems;Defect Detection;YOLO;Attention Mechanism;Automated industry,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 41st Chinese Control Conference (CCC),10.23919/CCC55666.2022.9902500
Gland segmentation in gastric histology images: detection of intestinal metaplasia,"Gastric cancer is one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) of the mucosa of the stomach has been found to increase the risk of gastric cancer and is considered as one of the precancerous lesions. Therefore, early detection of IM may have a valuable role in histopathological risk assessment regarding the possibility of progression to cancer. Accurate segmentation and analysis of gastric glands from the histological images plays an important role in the diagnostic confirmation of IM. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework for segmentation of gastric glands and detection of IM. More specifically, we propose the GAGL-Net for the segmentation of glands. Then, based on two features of the extracted glands we classify the tissues into normal and IM cases. The results showed that the proposed gland segmentation approach achieves an F1 score equal to 0.914. Furthermore, the proposed methodology shows great potential for the IM detection achieving an accuracy score equal to 96.6%. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology we used a publicly available dataset and we created the GAGL dataset consisting of 59 Whole Slide Images (WSI) including both IM and normal cases.",Support vector machines;Image segmentation;Stomach;Histopathology;Glands;Signal processing;Feature extraction;Gastric cancer;medical image segmentation;intestinal metaplasia detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 30th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO),10.23919/EUSIPCO55093.2022.9909628
An Unsupervised Parameter-Free Nuclei Segmentation Method for Histology Images,"An unsupervised nuclei segmentation method for histology images is proposed in this work. It consists of three modules applied to each of non-overlapping blocks: 1) data-driven color transform for dimension reduction, 2) fully-automated adaptive binarization, and 3) incorporation of geometric priors with morphological processing. The method is called CBM, which comes from the first letter of the three modules – ""Color transform"", ""Binarization"" and ""Morphological processing"".

Automatic Defect Segmentation by Unsupervised Anomaly Learning,"This paper addresses the problem of defect segmentation in semiconductor manufacturing. The input of our segmentation is a scanning-electron-microscopy (SEM) image of the candidate defect region. We train a U-net shape network to segment defects using a dataset of clean background images. The samples of the training phase are produced automatically such that no manual labeling is required. To enrich the dataset of clean background samples, we apply defect implant augmentation. To that end, we apply a copy-and-paste of a random image patch in the clean specimen. To improve the robustness of the unlabeled data scenario, we train the features of the network with unsupervised learning methods and loss functions. Our experiments show that we succeed to segment real defects with high quality, even though our dataset contains no defect examples.

Implicit Continuous Authentication Model Based on Mobile Terminal Touch Behavior,"Most existing identity authentication technologies rely on some ways for the first login authentication, such as personal identification number (PIN), track, or biological characteristics. However, these ways exist plenty of security risks, which make people face password guessing attacks, trace attacks, and shoulder surfing attacks for a long time. Once the illegal users forge identity to complete authentication or bypass first login authentication, their subsequent behavior will become out of control. To solve the above problems, we propose an implicit continuous authentication model based on the touch behavior of the mobile terminal. The model uses the data collected by the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to generate feature vectors and extracts the feature vectors containing macroscopic features, microscopic features, and joint features. And we design a convolutional bidirectional recurrent neural network model to distinguish the sensor feature vectors. On this basis, we perform various experiments on a large dataset Hand Movement, Orientation, and Grasp (HMOG) with different sensor characteristics. Compared with the most advanced models proposed recently, the results show that our model achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 0.53%, which significantly improves authentication accuracy.",Accelerometers;Recurrent neural networks;Magnetometers;Authentication;Shoulder;Feature extraction;Data models;identity authentication;mobile terminal;touch authentication;sensors,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC),10.1109/ISCC55528.2022.9913017
Analysis of Feature Extraction and Classification Methods on Histopathological Images for Diagnosing Invasive Ductal Carcinoma,"Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is one of the most common types of breast cancer, accounting for almost 70-80% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Early detection of breast cancer is an effort to prevent or control the occurrence of breast cancer. The first step in treating breast cancer is a proper examination, typically conducted using biomedical images such as mammograms and histopathology images. In this study, we conducted breast cancer detection using histopathological images in several steps, namely histopathological data input, feature extraction, and classification. As feature extraction is the most important step in the classification process, we combined several feature extraction techniques, including Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Red Green Blue (RGB), Hue Saturation Value (HSV), and Histogram. The feature extraction results were subsequently classified using the backpropagation and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. We used a public dataset from Kaggle that has 1,080 breast histopathology images consisting of 540 negative IDC and 540 positive IDC. Our experimental results show that combining the aforementioned feature extraction techniques and using a backpropagation classifier obtained the best prediction accuracy of 96.94%. The result implies that IDC type breast cancer based on histopathological images can be detected accurately using suitable methods.",Backpropagation;Support vector machines;Electrical engineering;Histograms;Sensitivity;Histopathology;Feature extraction;classification;feature extraction;histopathology;invasive ductal carcinoma,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 9th International Conference on Information Technology, Computer, and Electrical Engineering (ICITACEE)",10.1109/ICITACEE55701.2022.9923967

Object-oriented Domain Adaptation for Cell Detection on Pathology Image,"Pathology image automated analysis has made a huge breakthrough in recent years with the advance of deep learning techniques. However, automatically detecting all small cells in a pathology image is not trivial. Small objects have tiny scales thus only limited features could be utilized for detection. Small cells in pathological images make the detection task more challenging as the cells always have a similar appearance to the background. In this paper, we adopt an effective and lightweight method of data augmentation to improve cell detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel copy-paste strategy that greatly increases the diverse representations of small cells and thus enhances the robustness of the detection model in the complex scene. To handle the distribution discrepancy at the instance level which is brought by the data augmentation, we propose an object-oriented domain adaptation method accordingly. Our designed plug-and-play object-oriented domain adaptation is incorporated into the famous Faster R-CNN and gains a significant performance on self-made pathological data set.",Deep learning;Pathology;Adaptation models;Object oriented modeling;Feature extraction;Robustness;Task analysis;Small cell detection;Copy Paste;Domain adaptation,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Aided Education (ICISCAE),10.1109/ICISCAE55891.2022.9927666
Conditional image synthesis for improved segmentation of glomeruli in renal histopathological images,"In a context of limited data availability, we consider the supervised segmentation of glomerular structures in patches of renal histopathological whole slide images. These structures are complex, include multiple substructures, and exhibit great variability in their shape, making their robust segmentation challenging. In this context, using appropriate data augmentation techniques is crucial to obtain more robust results. We investigate data augmentation based on random spatial deformations and conditional image synthesis for the training of a U-Net model. We rely on a SPADE model to perform the synthesis, using label maps built from the real patches available for training as input. Synthesis from ground truth masks only results in noisy patches, where substructures are absent, whereas additional structure information yield more realistic patches. We show that the best improvements of the segmentation performances are obtained by mixing real patches with synthetic patches generated from ground truth masks only, which yields an increase of up to 0.76 of average dice score w.r.t. augmentation based on spatial deformations only. We conclude that, using conditional image synthesis, patches synthesized with no additional structure information better contribute to the robustness of glomeruli segmentation than patches synthesized with structure information extracted from available real patches.",Training;Deformable models;Image segmentation;Image synthesis;Shape;Robustness;Data models;Digital Histopathology;Glomeruli segmentation;Data augmentation;Conditional image synthesis,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI),10.1109/BHI56158.2022.9926880
The Structure of Nanaocrystalline Apatite From the Breast Cancer,"This paper is devoted to the morphology and elemental composition of breast cancer calcification. By histology, it we verified that all 30 selected breast cancer samples had a signs of the biomineralization. These calcified formations had dark blue color, variable size and round and irregular shapes. Von Cossa staining confirmed the presence of calcium phosphate in their composition. We have shown by SEM and TEM that the mineral deposits of breast cancer correspond to calcium phosphate in nanocrystalline calcium apatite. According to TEM, crystalline nanoparticles were polydisperse (of different sizes) with minor size variations (3-20 nm). Nanocrystals of breast cancer calcifications formed the polycrystalline mechanically stable agglomerates with sizes of 100-300 nm. At the same time, there was no signs of recrystallization with a noticeable increase in the size of individual components of these agglomerates.",Nanocrystals;Shape;Histopathology;Morphology;Crystals;Color;Feature extraction;calcification;breast cancer;calcium apatite,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE 12th International Conference Nanomaterials: Applications & Properties (NAP),10.1109/NAP55339.2022.9934287

A quantitative exploration of efficacy of gland morphology in prostate cancer grading,"Currently, prostate cancer diagnosis is done qualitatively by pathologists who visually analyze tissue architecture while largely ignoring gland morphology. In this study we have developed an automated image analysis scheme for grading prostate cancer by quantitatively analyzing morphological features of individual glands from digitized histological images. Following automated gland boundary segmentation via level sets, 7 boundary features are extracted. Non-linear dimensionality reduction is then applied to the set of extracted features. A Support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then used to classify tissue patches corresponding to benign epithelium, and prostate cancer grades 3 and 4 in a lower dimensional embedding space. We obtained an accuracy of 75.00% in distinguishing benign epithelium and grade 3, 85.71% between benign epithelium and grade 4, and 72.73% between grade 3 and grade 4.

Differential Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy Using Sensor Arrays,"In this paper, we introduce a new aperture-type near-Held scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) imaging concept that relies on specially designed large-area (e.g. >200 nm times 200 nm) aperture geometries having sharp corners. Unlike in conventional NSOM, the spatial resolution of this near-field imaging modality is not determined by the size of the aperture, but rather by the sharpness of the corners of the large aperture. This approach significantly improves the light throughput of the near-field probe and, hence, increases the SNR. Here, we discuss the basic concepts of this near-field microscopy approach and illustrate both theoretically and experimentally how an array of detectors can be utilized to further improve the SNR of the near-field image. The results of this work are particularly relevant for imaging of biological samples at a spatial resolution of < 50 nm with significantly improved image quality.",Sensor arrays;Optical sensors;Optical microscopy;Optical arrays;Optical imaging;Apertures;Biomedical optical imaging;Spatial resolution;Optical design;Geometrical optics;Differential NSOM (DNSOM);near-field imaging;near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM);SNOM,ARTICLE,2007,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics,10.1109/JSTQE.2007.910799

Classification framework for nailfold capillary microscopy images,"Nailfold capillary microscopy examination has been used since late 1950s as a non-invasive in-vivo technique for diagnosing and monitoring connective tissue disease in adults. Disorders such as Raynaud’s phenomenon, progressive systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis were detected in more than 80% of adult patients, by analyzing such high resolution images. In this research paper, we propose a framework to classify nailfold capillary microscopy images into SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) and PSS (Progress Systemic sclerosis) diseases. Based on statistical data collected in Taichung Veteran’s General Hospital (TCVGH), Taiwan, higher percentage of adult patients are find with SLE patients, when compared with PSS. According to ARA (American Rheumatism Association), patients’ outside features are obviously. The PSS patients are the same way to finding the features. And in the same time, we refer from doctor’s idea add other conditions to help judging. In the first step, RP is the most important element. Most of the SLE and PSS features are raised by RP. In the other way, the features can be found in both of SLE and PSS patients.

Studies of organic-inorganic hydride materials for nonlinear optical applications,"Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, due to their nonlinear properties, have been found to have enormous applications in frequency conversion, image processing, data storage, fiber optic communication, etc. Recently, variety of semi-organic crystals for nonlinear optics applications have been developed, among them the donor-acceptor molecule are found to have definite edge over others as they display special features of interest, such as nitroanilines have inherently large second-order microscopic polarizabilities and they seem to be very good candidates for nonlinear optical materials. As far as we know, there has been only one attempt to systematically explore the second-order nonlinear response of clusters of these chromophores to relate the resulting intermolecular interactions to the quadratic hyperpolarizabilities, these molecular interactions being of the dipole-dipole type. A potentially useful organic-inorganic nonlinear optical aqueous solutions of p-Nitroanilinium with different anions (nitrate, sulphate and perchlorate) has been synthesized at room temperature by slow solvent evaporation method.

Forensic Techniques for Investigating the Causes of Fiber Rope Failures,"This paper discusses techniques that are used to determine the underlying causes of fiber rope failures. Rope failures can exhibit a complex mixture of features that are sometimes difficult to interpret and understand. It is necessary to distinguish between those features which occurred during or after a failure from those that may have caused or contributed to it and this requires both judgement and experience. An investigation always starts with a visual examination and preliminary unravelling of the fail zones of the rope. Selective tensile testing is then used to generate data that can be used to estimate the rope strength at the time of fail. If necessary, further techniques such as optical and scanning electron microscopy are used to provide additional information for a more detailed understanding of a failure. Thermal stability and UV resistance may also have to be assessed when investigating failures of certain types of rope and techniques for doing these investigations are also described. As with any type of forensic investigation, the objective must be to gather as much information as possible, from as many different perspectives as possible, to permit the correct conclusion to be drawn as to the cause or causes of any rope failure. Examples from several fiber rope failure investigations are discussed in the paper.",Forensics;Optical microscopy;Thermal resistance;Fatigue;Testing;Scanning electron microscopy;Synthetic fibers;Yarn;Electron optics;Creep,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,OCEANS 2007,10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449341

In each image, the cells are shown in blue color while in the interior of every cell an area proportional to the degree of the cell DNA fragmentation has been stained in reddish color by the assay procedure. The proposed digital image analysis technique suggests a segmentation method based on the Primary Component Analysis (PCA) applied to the 3-D color space. In this way the shapes in every image are isolated and then a classification technique is used to obtain only the shapes representing solitary spermatozoa, to ignore those presenting cell overlapping and dispose small shapes-scraps belonging to fragments of useless material created during the assay procedure.

Dynamic Nano-scale Surface Profilometry Using Stroboscopic Interferometry,"Dynamic 3-D nano-scale surface profilometry using stroboscopic interferometry was successfully developed. An optical microscopy based on stroboscopic interferometry was developed to achieve full-field vibratory out-of-plane surface profilometry and system characterization. To increase the measurement bandwidth of the developed system, an innovative image processing algorithm based on deconvolution principle was developed to improve the signal to noise ratio of the detected interferometric data. The method provides an excellent way to increase the measurement bandwidth without adding any significant hardware in a stroboscopic interferometric framework. Meanwhile, an innovative detection algorithm based on image contrast measure was developed for automatic identification of accurate resonant modes. To verify the effectiveness of the developed methodology, a cross microbeam was measured to analyze the full-field resonant vibratory modes and dynamic characteristics. The experimental results confirm that the dynamic behavior of the tested microcantilever beams can be accurately characterized and 5 nm of vertical measurement accuracy as well as tens micrometers of vertical measurement range can be achieved.

Evolutions in Microstructure and Property of Sn-Ag-Cu Lead-free Solders with Trace Addition of Magnesium,"Sn-Ag-Cu-Mg (SACM) lead-free solders based on near eutectic Sn-Ag-Cu alloys were designed and prepared in this work. Experiments were carried out to explore the effect of trace addition of Mg on microstructure, and property. The microstructure observation and phase identification were carried out by means of optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) respectively. The melting characteristic, wettability and thermal stability of SACM solders with 0.1 to 0.7 wt% Mg were evaluated and compared with Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu and Sn-0.7Cu solder alloys by differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and microhardness tester. It is found that only the SACM solder with 0.1 wt.% addition of Mg kept the typical microstructure of near eutectic Sn-Ag-Cu. With more than 0.1 wt.% addition of Mg, the eutectic network was coarsened and the fraction of eutectic microstructure decreased. Especially, with 0.7 wt.% Mg, platelet (AgMg)3Sn eutectic phase and bulk-like SnAgCuMg-rich phases emerged in SACM solder. The melting temperature decreased obviously when trace Mg was added into the ternary Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloy systems while the wettability was inferior to those of Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu and Sn- 0.7Cu. After aging treatment, the results of XRD and microhardness testing showed that the SACM solders with trace Mg addition demonstrated nearly the same thermostablization as Sn-4.0Ag-0.50Cu..",Microstructure;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Lead;Magnesium;Optical microscopy;Scanning electron microscopy;X-ray scattering;Testing;Electron optics;Dispersion,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 9th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference,10.1109/EPTC.2007.4469835

Ceramic image processing using the second curvelet transform and watershed algorithm,"Ceramic materials physical properties are the results from their microstructures characteristics. So, it is very important to quantify these characteristics in an accurate way. Ceramic microscopic image processing may be divided into two main procedures: image pre-processing for noise reduction and edges enhancement to clarify the image and image segmentation for locating and detecting the objects of interest. Conventional 2D wavelet transform is separable and thus can not sparsely represent non-separable structures of the image, such as directional curves. Curvelet transform is a new extension to wavelet transform in two dimensions. The directionality feature of curvelet transform makes it a good choice for representation of curves and edges in the image. The second generation curvelet transform theory makes it understood and implemented more easily. In this paper, a new enhancement function is proposed to enhance the edges by curvelet transform. The method is also compared with two usual contrast enhancement methods, histogram equalization and wavelet based contrast enhancement. It is shown that the contrast enhancement method based on curvelet transform is superior to both histogram equalization and the method based on wavelet transform, in both enhancement of fine structures and reduction of noise in the images. This enhancement method is used to ceramic images pre-processing, and then watershed algorithm is applied to the segmentation. The grain size distributions can be obtained from segmentation images. It has been proved that this method is effective for the ceramic grain image.",Ceramics;Image processing;Wavelet transforms;Image segmentation;Noise reduction;Image edge detection;Histograms;Microstructure;Microscopy;Object detection;Ceramic image;second curvelet transform;contrast enhancement;watershed algorithm,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO),10.1109/ROBIO.2007.4522481
Screening of Apoptotic Genes by Morphological Analysis of High Throughput Fluorescence Microscopy Images,"Apoptosis is a programmed cell death required for development and maintenance of normal tissue. However, cancer cells often evade apoptosis by inactivating apoptotic genes. Thus, the discovery of apoptotic genes has become important in cancer research. We developed a morphological analysis to quantify apoptosis automatically. Cellular images were acquired by high throughput fluorescence microscopy and normalized. Nuclear and chromatin images were segmented by tophat operations and touching nuclei were further separated by erosion, labeling, and conditional dilation. Shape and intensity features were extracted from nuclear and chromatin images to produce discriminant functions by logistic regression. Nuclear objects were classified as isolated and touching with 91.7% accuracy. Apoptotic and mitotic nuclei were identified with 88.8% accuracy. Automatic apoptotic rates were highly correlated with manual rates (p = 0.91, p<0.01). Finally, 20 genes that included seven novel apoptotic genes were found out of 21 genes previously reported to show 3-fold increase of apoptosis.",Image analysis;Throughput;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Cancer;Image segmentation;Labeling;Shape;Feature extraction;Logistics,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 Frontiers in the Convergence of Bioscience and Information Technologies,10.1109/FBIT.2007.46
Fractal based classification of Colon cancer tissue images,An attempt has been made to classify the histopathological images of colon cancer tissues from the normal tissues based only on fractal features. The tissue images are modelled as fractal sets in E3 euclidian space. A new fractal feature estimation algorithm has been used. We call it true box counting method. It is seen that lacunarity features are important parameters and are more important in classification or segmentation than other fractal features like fractal dimension and mass dimension.,Fractals;Colon;Cancer;Image reconstruction;Data mining;Lesions;Solids;Surface reconstruction;Image segmentation;Entropy,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 9th International Symposium on Signal Processing and Its Applications,10.1109/ISSPA.2007.4555279
Normal and cancer breast epithelial cells endocytosis study of nanoparticles by combined AFM and NSOM microscopy,"A substantial understanding of nanoparticles recognition and uptake by biological cells and tissues is very important for reaching their fullest potential in biomedical research. In this work, we investigated the cell endocytosis of iron oxide nanoparticles by both normal breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) and cancer breast epithelial cells (MCF7) using a combination of atomic force microscope (AFM) and nearfield scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) without the need of fluorescent labeling. This hybrid AFM/NSOM imaging method is capable of simultaneous recording topographic and near-field optical images, which provide complementary information in both morphology and optical analyses on the cellular exterior and interior. The resolution of images was observed to be very close to the size of tip. For both cell types, the iron oxide nanoparticles without targeting agents were found to be actively uptaken by a vesicle-mediated transport via a two-step process: a first step of binding at the cell membrane, followed by an subsequent internalization step.",Nanoparticles;Iron;Microscopy;Biomembranes;Magnetic resonance imaging;Optical microscopy;Cells (biology);AFM;cell endocytosis;iron oxide nanoparticle;NSOM,INPROCEEDINGS,2007,2007 7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE NANO),10.1109/NANO.2007.4601358
Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Multi-Fractal Dimension Spectra,"The research presented in this paper was aimed to develop a classification system of breast tumors tissues using histopathological images. The paper focuses on using the advantages of fractal geometry texture analysis. The developed approach consists of two main steps: (i) the extraction of the fractal dimension spectra for the regions of interest, and (ii) using a classifier that automatically identifies the kind of the tested breast tumor tissue. The performance of the classifier was enhanced by using k-means clustering algorithm; this algorithm was utilized to define sets of centroids, such that each set various states of a specific kind of breast tumors tissue. The classification powers of several fractal dimension spectra descriptors have been investigated. The proposed classification methods were applied on 24 different histopathological breast tumors images.

MSF-Model: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion-Based Domain Adaptive Model for Breast Cancer Classification of Histopathology Images,"One of the most common causes of mortality for women globally is breast cancer. Early breast cancer identification could make it possible for people to receive the appropriate treatment to save their lives and return to their routine lives. Breast cancer diagnosis by histopathology is referred to as the gold standard. In recent years, convolutional neural network-based techniques are used for breast cancer classification. However, they faced domain adaptation, small objects retention, and feature extraction issues of complex microscopic images. In this study, we introduced multi-scale feature fusion-based domain adaptive model for breast cancer classification using histopathology images. It has two blocks and six lightweight sub-models where each block contains three models. Dilated layers are used in sub-models to overcome the disappearing of small objects in deep layers. Reducing the disappearing of small objects helped to extract better features for higher performance. Multiple heterogeneous feature extractors are used in this study which helped to extract various features. Extracted features are fused and reduced by retaining better features. Learning of model from natural images to complex microscopic images has limitation of domain adaptation. Same domain transfer learning is used in this study to overcome the limitations of different domain transfer learning. Model is trained on patchcamelyon17 dataset and weights of this training are further used for same domain transfer learning. Pre-trained weights are further used for the training of proposed model on BreaKHis dataset. A number of conventional data augmentation techniques are used as complex models require higher number of samples for the tuning of weights. Local window based CLAHE contrast enhancement technique is used to increase foreground-background contrast and remove noise. The proposed model achieved 98.00% precision, 98.15% recall, 98.08% f-measure, and 98.23% accuracy on test data. To best of our knowledge, it surpassed state-of-the-art models.",Feature extraction;Histopathology;Solid modeling;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Breast cancer;Deep learning;convolutional neural networks;breast cancer classification;histopathology images,ARTICLE,2022,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3223870
Synthetic microfibers discriminated by AI-enabled polarization resolved Digital Holography,"The release of synthetic microfibers in marine waters, caused by textile industries and washing machine drains, is severely impacting the ecosystem, especially animals up to humans. The detection and identification of microplastic fibers is aimed to fight pollution, and several methodologies take the field. Among the recent imaging technologies, Digital Holography (DH) is contributing a lot for microplastic discrimination. Here, we demonstrate how the polarization-resolved DH microscopy, for both static and in-flow experiments, is capable to be material specific, exploiting the intrinsic optical features of synthetic and natural samples fiber-shaped, such as Jones matrix characterization and birefringence property. We reach high accuracy for the microfibers in-flow classification applying a machine-learning pipeline and a good clustering of the different specimens' classes using the Jones formalism.

Psychology-Inspired Interaction Process Analysis based on Time Series,"Interaction portrays the process of exchanging emotions and states between individuals in a specific temporal and spatial context. Interactions are layered on a temporal scale, including social signals at an instant, intrinsic structures of a process, and enduring relationships between the participants. Existing studies of affective computing focus on the identification of social signals at specific moments, which are precise but limited to the microscopic level; while psychological studies focus on the process and relationship analysis, which are semantic but qualitative. In this paper, we focused on interaction process analysis. By combining psychological knowledge and time series analysis techniques, we proposed quantitative methods for features of personal status, dyad correlation, synchrony coefficients, and ‘lead-follow’ structures. We conducted experiments on the mother-infant interaction dataset. We first compared the differences in interaction patterns between social signals. We found that gaze direction in the free-play phase, emotion synchrony in the recov-ery phase, and engagement in both phases, play an important role in differentiating attachment styles. We then explored the differences in interaction patterns. We found the ‘infant dropping while mother rising’ asynchrony coefficient and the ‘infant leads, mother follows’ structure related to secure attachment styles. Finally, we successfully predicted infant attachment formed one year later based on machine learning methods, confirming the effectiveness of our feature extraction method.",Correlation;Microscopy;Time series analysis;Semantics;Psychology;Machine learning;Feature extraction,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 26th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),10.1109/ICPR56361.2022.9956367
Metallurgical AuSn Bonding of Piezoelectric Layers,"This study presents a novel and simple approach to form metallurgical bonds between layers of the acoustic stack in an ultrasound transducer using a eutectic AuSn preform, which is a pre-shaped thin sheet of solder. The bonding takes 10 minutes and yields uniform bondlines of 10 μm with a melting temperature of 280 °C. The resulting bonds are electrically conductive, mechanically robust and have a characteristic acoustic impedance of 29 Mrayls. AuSn bonding was demonstrated by successfully bonding two equally thick layers of PZT. The bonded PZT-stacks were polarized and sub-diced into a 2-dimensional array. Characterization was performed by optical microscopy, scanning acoustic microscopy and electrical impedance measurements. Combining scanning acoustic microscopy and electrical impedance measurements proved to be a useful approach to experimentally study inter-element variations induced by varying concentrations of voids in a metallurgical bondline.",Temperature measurement;Optical microscopy;Impedance measurement;Ultrasonic imaging;Transducers;Temperature;Microscopy;Ultrasound;Piezoelectric Transducers;Fabrication;Metallurgical Bonding;Characterization,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),10.1109/IUS54386.2022.9957587
Multi-Instance Classification of Histopathological Breast Cancer Images with Visual Explanation,"Breast cancer is a big concern for women due to its higher mortality compared to other cancers. Objective and accurate early diagnosis is primordial for the treatment and survival improvement of patients. Histopathological image classification is considered the gold standard and is usually the last and most dependent diagnosis approach for doctors to make patient treatment proposals. In particular, recent deep learning-based methods provide remarkable classification results. However, these methods ignore rationale or logical explanation that is important for diagnosis reliability and human-level understanding. This paper proposes a multi-instance classification network (MICNet) with the mechanism of visual explanation to achieve the explainable classification of histopathological breast cancer images. The method uses a simple two-dimensional convolution kernel to generate explanation maps (i.e., visual explanation) through features coming from the end of the feature extractor in the VGG11 model pre-trained by ImageNet. Multiple instance learning (MIL) based on mirror padding and overlap cropping is adopted to improve the network’s classification performance. We also design a weighted average pooling method to encourage the network to learn more accurate visual explanation. Experiments on BreakHis and Camelyon16 patch-based datasets demonstrate that our MICNet outperforms other CNN models in classification and is able to provide a logical visual explanation that supports the network’s prediction.",Visualization;Convolution;Medical treatment;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Reliability;histopathological images;deep learning;breast cancer classification;multiple instance learning;visual explanation,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 16th IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP),10.1109/ICSP56322.2022.9965331
"Classification of Colorectal Cancer Based on Histological Image Using a Combination of Color Histogram, Haralick and k-NN","Colorectal cancer is the progression of malignancy of cancer that occurs in the colon or rectum, which is a small part of the large intestine before the anus. Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of malignant cancer in the world, and it is estimated that by 2030 it will increase by 60%, from 2.2 million new cases with a prevalence of 1.1 million deaths from this cancer. Colorectal cancer can occur due to several factors such as a history of colon polyps, a history of chronic diseases that occur in the intestines and lifestyle and often men are more at risk of developing the disease than women. In the early stages of cancer often cannot be known and do not cause symptoms and will only be realized after developing quite severe, therefore an early examination is needed in order to determine the condition of the cancer and as an anticipation or prevention so as not to worsen the situation. Examination of colorectal cancer can be done with a biopsy technique, where tissue or histopathological images can be observed. can be done automatically by utilizing computer vision technology using machine learning methods. This study aims to propose a method that can classify colorectal cancer 5000 histology images. The method proposed in this study uses the Random Forest machine learning method with a combination of Color Histogram and Haralick feature extraction. The results obtained in this study provide a good accuracy value of 93,53%.",Histograms;Technological innovation;Intestines;Image color analysis;Training data;Feature extraction;History;Colorectal Cancer;Color Histogram;Haralick;Machine Learning;k-NN,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 International Conference on Information Technology Research and Innovation (ICITRI),10.1109/ICITRI56423.2022.9970214
Image Segmentation for Colorectal cancer histopathological images analysis,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and the second most deadly cancer. The most efficient way to determine CRC staging is to analyze whole slide digital pathology images; therefore, it is certainly important to ensure the accuracy of pathology slide analysis.We can obtain medical quantized data of pathological images by implementing deep learning methods. These methods not only can light pathologists’ load but also can provide accurate computing results.In this paper, we use U-2-NET as our backbone to perform Binary Image Segmentation on CRC pathology slides. CRC pathology slides have a variety of non-conforming shapes and colors which is an enormous challenge for detecting cancer areas. U-2-NET was originally used in the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task to find the most unique regions of human attention, which can be used to identify abnormal regions in pathological slices. Moreover, the RSU block of U-2-NET can handle long-term and short-term dependencies, which we believe helps maintain contextual information. With the large computational costs, U-2-NET is hard to implement for application. Our purposed method can use preprocessing, image-selecting mechanisms and transfer learning concepts to solve this problem.Our results show that the model trained with a small part of the data set and a modified small object function has the best results for Binary Image Segmentation of colorectal cancer pathology sections by U-2-NET, with the best IOU (0.77) and Dice Loss (0.83) compared with other models (MSRFCNN, FCN, SegNet, and Unet). Furthermore, after transferring learning using pre-trained weights from the SOD dataset, the results are improved compared to those of learning the network from scratch.",Pathology;Image segmentation;Shape;Image color analysis;Transfer learning;Object detection;Data models;Colorectal cancer;U-2-NET;Salient object detection;styling,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE International Conference on Recent Advances in Systems Science and Engineering (RASSE),10.1109/RASSE54974.2022.9989848
Enhancing Background Luminance for Colorectal Cancer H and E Stained Images using Modified Reinhard Technique,"With the advent of AI and Machine learning based learning, the overall process of cancer diagnosis became much smoother and faster through automated techniques. Because of the presence of artefacts that cause color changes in H&E stained histopathology images, color normalization is an important pre-processing step for cancer identification. However, the existing color normalization methods suffers from two major issues: Loss of information that leads to poor background luminance and huge computational complexity. To address this issue, we developed a modified Reinhard approach for color normalizing on the CRC dataset in order to improve the background luminance of H&E stained colorectal cancer histopathology photographs. Our proposed algorithm not only mitigate the limitations of the previous reinhard method but statistically satisfy all four hypothesis of the color normalization by incorporating a global feature along with local one. Our algorithm's performance was also compared to that of other current color normalization algorithms, and it was shown to be superior in both quantitative and qualitative terms.",Image color analysis;Histopathology;Machine learning;Computational complexity;Cancer;Histopathology;Hematoxylin and Eosin;Color Normalization;Colon cancer;Modified Reinhard;Background Luminance;Correlation Coefficient,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 2nd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICTACS),10.1109/ICTACS56270.2022.9988330
Trans2Unet: Neural fusion for Nuclei Semantic Segmentation,"Nuclei segmentation, despite its fundamental role in histopathological image analysis, is still a challenge work. The main challenge of this task is the existence of overlapping areas, which makes separating independent nuclei more complicated. In this paper, we propose a new two-branch architecture by combining the Unet and TransUnet networks for nuclei segmentation task. In the proposed architecture, namely Trans2Unet, the input image is first sent into the Unet branch whose the last convolution layer is removed. This branch makes the network combine features from different spatial regions of the input image and localizes more precisely the regions of interest. The input image is also fed into the second branch. In the second branch, which is called TransUnet branch, the input image will be divided into patches of images. With Vision transformer (ViT) in architecture, TransUnet can serve as a powerful encoder for medical image segmentation tasks and enhance image details by recovering localized spatial information. To boost up Trans2Unet efficiency and performance, we proposed to infuse TransUnet with a computational-efficient variation called “Waterfall” Atrous Spatial Pooling with Skip Connection (WASP-KC) module, which is inspired by the “Waterfall” Atrous Spatial Pooling (WASP) module. Experiment results on the 2018 Data Science Bowl benchmark show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed architecture while compared with previous segmentation models.",Image segmentation;Image analysis;Semantic segmentation;Microprocessors;Computer architecture;Data science;Transformers;Unet;TransUnet;Vision Transformer;WASP;Image Medical Segmentation;Nuclei segmentation,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 11th International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)",10.1109/ICCAIS56082.2022.9990159
Region of Interest Localisation of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cell Images,"Image classification using deep learning has been widely implemented, primarily in medical imaging. However, features and focus regions are extracted by the network, becomes a black box mystery in the feature extraction layer during network training, unlike conventional feature extraction approaches, where various methods can extract image features. Regardless, traditional image feature extraction is laborious to find the most suitable algorithm. It takes time to meet the significant image features before classification and final image localisation, especially for the microscopic images. Therefore, a method to localise the region of interest (ROI) in vitro of the colony-formation unit (CFU) of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) using gradCAM through deep learning, approaches have been proposed. This work comprises three main phases: CFU data preparation, convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained networks and localisation of the ROI. The proposed method has successfully localised the ROI of the CFU HSPC using gradCAM through a deep neural network with 87.5% sensitivity performed by DarkNet19. The finding of this work can be used as a baseline for future CFU HSPC classification that focuses on the CFU region.",Deep learning;Training;Sensitivity;Microscopy;Neural networks;Focusing;Feature extraction;colony-formation unit (CFU);region of interest (ROI);deep learning;CFU analysis,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 IEEE 10th Conference on Systems, Process & Control (ICSPC)",10.1109/ICSPC55597.2022.10001743
Survival Prediction for Gastric Cancer via Multimodal Learning of Whole Slide Images and Gene Expression,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. As histopathology tissue analysis is considered as the gold standard in cancer studies, whole slide images (WSIs) have been widely used for GC diagnosis and prognosis, while multimodal studies for GC patients have been very few. Especially, WSIs and gene expression are complementary modalities of data, thus fusion of these two modalities has great potential in the prediction of survival outcomes and other computer-aided tasks, like the mechanism study and clinical treatment for GC patients. However, multimodal learning requires good data fusion strategies and also suffers from the missing data issue. To address these issues, we propose GC-SPLeM, to predict risk scores for patients, which consists of three parts, WSI feature extraction, modal-fusing network, and GNN-based predictor. We conduct experiments on a GC dataset built by ourselves and a public dataset for survival prediction. For both datasets, GC-SPLeM outperforms the state-of-the-art single-modality learning method and multimodal learning method by large margins (over 5% on C-index). We find that the GNN plays an important role in performance enhancement. Through learning the graph of patients, topological structure and neighborhood clinical information are encoded into feature representations of patients. GC-SPLeM not only improves the survival prediction results but also has advantages in dealing with incomplete data over other methods.

Joint Feature Learning for Cell Segmentation Based on Multi-scale Convolutional U-Net,"A major challenge in the analysis of tissue imaging data is cell segmentation, the task of identifying precisely the boundary of each cell in a microscopic image. The cell segmentation task is still challenging due to the variable shapes, large size differences, uneven grayscale, and dense distribution of biological cells in microscopic images. In this paper, we propose a joint feature learning method that integrates the density and boundary branch into a multi-scale convolutional U-Net (MC-Unet). To enhance the supervision of cell density and boundary detection, the density and boundary loss is constructed to guide the joint learning of multiple features, where the density loss branch can address the challenges posed by high density, while the boundary loss branch can address the problems of unclear cell boundaries and partial cell occlusion. A series of experiments on different cell datasets show that two auxiliary branches improve the learning of features on cell density and cell boundaries and that the proposed method is effective on different segmentation models.

Unsupervised Heterogeneous Cryo-EM Projection Image Classification Using Autoencoder,"Heterogeneous three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a significant but very challenging technique for recovering conformational heterogeneity of proteins or other biological macromolecules and their complexes in different functional states. Heterogeneous projection image classification is an effective way for solving the heterogeneity problem in single-particle cryo-EM. Most existing heterogeneous projection image classification methods are based on supervised learning or require a large amount of a priori knowledge, such as the common lines or orientations of the projection images, which has many limitations in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised heterogeneous cryo-EM projection image classification algorithm based on autoencoders that only needs to know the number of heterogeneous conformations in the dataset and does not require any labeling information of the projection images as well as other prior knowledge. We implement a simple autoencoder with a multi-layer perceptron that is trained in iterative mode and a complex autoencoder with a residual network that is trained in one-pass learning mode to convert heterogeneous projection images into latent variables. The extracted high-dimensional features are reduced to two dimensions by the uniform manifold approximate and projection dimensionality reduction algorithm and then cluster them using the spectral clustering algorithm. The proposed algorithm is applied to two heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets to demonstrate its classification performance. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract category features of heterogeneous projection images and can classify them with high accuracy.",Proteins;Three-dimensional displays;Microscopy;Computational modeling;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Approximation algorithms;cryo-electron microscopy;single-particle reconstruction;structural heterogeneity;autoencoder;unsupervised classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM55620.2022.9995208
A Context-Guided Attention Method for Integrating Features of Histopathological Patches,"Lots of researchers have studied for classifying histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). Since a WSI is too large to be processed directly, researchers usually cut it into many small-sized patches and then integrate the discriminative features extracted from the patches to obtain a slide-level feature of the WSI. The integration strategy generating the slide-level features is crucial for the WSI classification model. Lots of attention-based methods have been proposed for such purpose. However, most attention-based methods do not take the patches relationship into consideration, which affects the classification performance of the models. In this work, we propose a novel Context-Guided attention (CGattention) method to integrate the patch-level features, which constructs a context vector to simulate the global context information of the whole WSI and implicitly characterizes the relationship between patches in the WSI. When evaluated on two publicly available datasets, the CGattention based model obtained the better performance than other attention-based models.",Representation learning;Image analysis;Histopathology;Computational modeling;Lung cancer;Feature extraction;Computational efficiency;Histopathology;Whole Slide Image (WSI);Context-Guided Attention;Feature Integration;Classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM55620.2022.9995300
Rat Swarm Optimizer based Transform for Performance Improvement of Machine Learning Classifiers in Diagnosis of Lung Cancer,"Usage of Machine Learning algorithms for assisting healthcare providers is increasing day by day. But the performance and robustness of the machine learning algorithms are the main concerns while implementing them for critical healthcare applications such as detection of cancer. This work concentrates on the performance improvement of supervised classifiers through the feature transform based on Rat Swarm Optimizer in diagnosing lung cancer using histopathological images. Rat Swarm Optimizer used for the transformation of features. These transformed features are more capable of providing better classification accuracy when compared to normal features. The dataset is downloaded from the publicly available website and three classes are present: normal, lung squamous cell carcinomas, and lung adenocarcinomas. In each class, 1000 histopathological images are considered. Four supervised classifiers namely Histogram-Gradient boosting classifier, Random forest classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, and Linear Discriminant Analysis classifiers are tested.

Improved Bump Detection and Defect Identification for HBMs using Refined Machine Learning Approach,"The 2D-3D metrology is a critical step for in-line inspection and off-line failure analysis. Due to lack of relevant data and complexity of embedded components, identifying and segmenting defects such as voids, pad misalignments in 2D and 3D voxel data has been a challenge in the semiconductor industry. Addressing this problem has the potential to further improve fault detection in this field significantly. This work follows our previously published works in EPTC 2020, ECTC 2021, introducing a cost-effective and non-destructive approach using deep learning and 3D x-ray microscopy. In particular, we apply our 3D object detection and Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) image segmentation on High Bandwidth memory and logic bumps (HBMs).

Histopathology DatasetGAN: Synthesizing Large-Resolution Histopathology Datasets,"Deep learning-based methods have powered recent advancements in medical image segmentation, accelerating the field past previous statistical and Machine Learning-based methods [1]. This, however, has simultaneously created a need for large quantities of labeled data, which is difficult in domains such as medical imaging where labeling is expensive and requires expert knowledge. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses these limitations by augmenting labeled data with large quantities of more widely available unlabeled data. Existing semi-supervised frameworks based on pseudo-labeling [2] or contrastive methods [3], however, struggle to scale to the high resolution of medical image datasets. In this work, we propose the Histopathology DatasetGAN (HDGAN) framework, an extension of the DatasetGAN framework for image generation and segmentation that scales well to large-resolution histopathology images. We make several adaptations on the original framework, including updating the generative backbone, selectively extracting latent features from the generator, and switching to memory-mapped arrays. These changes reduce the memory consumption of the framework, improving its applicability to medical imaging domains.",Image segmentation;Image resolution;Histopathology;Image synthesis;Memory management;Switches;Semisupervised learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium (SPMB),10.1109/SPMB55497.2022.10014968
Attention-driven RetinaNet for Parasitic Egg Detection,"Automatic microorganism detection, segmentation, and identification are essential to speeding up research in parasitology, biological treatment processes, and environment quality evaluation. Traditional methods based on microscopic images aim to find the differences in morphological features among the target species, such as outer shape and local features. This research focuses on species that share similar round shapes and seriously affect human health. Previous works show that segmentation is an essential step in improving detection accuracy. However, preparing segmentation ground truth is labor-intensive, especially in large datasets. For the dataset with no segmentation ground truths, we first generate pseudo-segmentation ground truths for training by applying a pre-trained segmentation network on a smaller dataset. We propose Attention-driven RetinaNet to detect, segment, and identify microorganisms in the microscopic images even when the training datasets have no annotated segmentation. The attention mechanism is applied to refine the incorrect pseudo-segmentation ground truths via Guided-attention. Self-attention is applied to select the essential part of the microorganism to improve detection performance. Experiments on the IEEE Parasitic Egg Detection and Classification in Microscopic Images Competition dataset show that the proposed method achieves 0.82 in mAP and outperforms other object detection methods.",Training;Image segmentation;Microorganisms;Shape;Microscopy;Object detection;Feature extraction;Parasitic egg;microorganisms;object detection;attention,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM),10.1109/ISM55400.2022.00060

Counting and Characterization of Platelets Using Mathematical Morphology,"Platelets, medically also termed as “Thrombocytes” are diminutive, achromatic fragments of cell in our vital fluid, blood, that form clots and prevents or stops bleeding. Various techniques and methodologies have been introduced and implemented apart from the conventional microscopic techniques to detect and count them, as platelets are one of the important cells in the bloodstream. The previously introduced techniques cannot determine the irregular and overlapped cells. This project proposes the Otsu Threshold Algorithm as an efficient algorithm that returns an exclusive intensity threshold that separates the pixels into two classes which are named as foreground and background. Mathematical Morphologies like dilation and erosion will help to smoothen the edges of the binary image from the otsu threshold output. For detecting circles or improper shapes, an algorithm named Circular Hough Transformation or CHT using various extraction techniques in digital image processing will be implemented. As a result, this project will classify and enumerate the platelet cells according to their shape and size (circular, non-circular, size, overlapped and negligible) and determine the count of the cells using Circular Hough Transformation (CHT) in raw microscopic images with a classification accuracy of 97%.",Computer vision;Image segmentation;Thresholding (Imaging);Fluids;Shape;Blood platelets;Microscopy;Platelets;Raw Microscopic Images Detection;Image Processing;Classification;Count;Otsu Thresholding;Circular Hough Transformation Collaborative filtering;CBR;deep learning;K-Means Algorithm,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 International Conference on Data Science, Agents & Artificial Intelligence (ICDSAAI)",10.1109/ICDSAAI55433.2022.10028801
Brain Cancer Diagnosis Based on Histopathological Images Using Handcrafted Features,"Traditionally, pathologists have used a light microscope to examine tissue sections mounted on glass slides to diagnose and categorize brain tumors. The outcomes of this method may not always be perfectly correct and are labor- and time-intensive. The procedure of classifying tumors could be made better using the computer-aided method. In this paper, we present an automated procedure that combines the following three feature extraction techniques to classify histopathological images of brain tumors: color histogram, Hu invariant moments, and scale-invariant hybrid image descriptor (RSHD). Color normalization and augmentation techniques are used for preprocessing the histopathological images before the feature extraction phase. In order to classify brain tumor images, three feature sets were extracted. Next, the generated features were fused together to form a combined feature set fed into the machine learning classifier. For differentiating between different sub-types of brain cancer, the XGBoost model performs best in terms of classification accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall.

Semantic Segmentation in Medical Image Based on Hybrid Dlinknet and Unet,"Medical imagery segmentation has been widely using deep learning approaches, which are quickly evolving in semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, due to their poor performance, newly proposed methods like Fully Convolutional Network, U-Net, LinkNet and SegNet still require enhancement to offer better semantic segmentation while identifying breast cancer. Therefore, this article presents a hybrid encoder and decoder framework in histology images of tissue slides. The novel network is designed with DlinkNet and UNet with a fusion of medical imagery data. An Attention Gate Module (AGM) is inserted into the proposed network to enrich the network learning’s capacity. This way, semantic features are extracted and semantically segmented in the tumors in the input image set. The effectiveness of the planned network is investigated concerning various parameters like Maximum Symmetric Surface Distance (MSSD 35.98), Accuracy (99.2%), Relative Absolute Volume Difference (RAVD 3.41), Jaccard index (0.83), Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD 0.629), Sensitivity (91%) and Dice Coefficient (DICE) (0.928) with existing networks of FPN and SENet.",Sensitivity;Histopathology;Semantic segmentation;Semantics;Logic gates;Feature extraction;Decoding;Semantic segmentation;medical image;encoder-decoder;attention gate module;DlinkNet and UNet,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,"2022 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems (ICCCIS)",10.1109/ICCCIS56430.2022.10037693
Gas Ash Microscopic Image Segmentation with SLIC and Mean Shift,"For the problems of long processing time, fragmentary clustering regions and poor segmentation accuracy of gas ash microscopic image segmentation with traditional mean shift algorithm, this paper proposes an improved image segmentation method combining simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) and mean shift. Firstly, SLIC algorithm is employed to generate a certain number of superpixels of gas ash microscopic images. Then, color, texture, and position information of each superpixel are extracted, and mapped into feature space for mean shift clustering. Finally, an adaptive region merging algorithm is used to further merge similar regions. The experimental results indicate that as a sample mode, the generated superpixels are more effective than original pixels in mean shift clustering, that is, the processing time is greatly shorten and clustering regions are more complete. Owing to the addition of texture features, the generated target areas are more accurate, especially for mosaic structure.

Human Dendritic Cells Classification based on Possibility Theory,"Dendritic cells can be seen as a mirror of our immune system. Based on their in virto analysis, biological experts are now able to study the impact of food contaminants on the human immune system. Accordingly, a visual characterization of dendritic cell morphology can provide an indirect estimation of the toxicity. In this paper, we propose an automatic classification of dendritic cells that could serve as a second non-subjective opinion for pathologists. The proposed approach is built on pre-processing steps for segmentation and cell detection in microscopic images. Then, a set of features such as shape descriptors are extracted for cell characterization. At this step, three cell classes are distinctively identified by experts. Nevertheless, a high ambiguity is revealed between cell classes. Possibility theory can offer a realistic framework for making reliable decisions under high ambiguity. It exploits a human natural concept of the implicit use of probability distribution for deciding on the possibility of some assertions in some contexts where a cognitive conflict is observed while interfering existing related postulates, leading to high ambiguity. Based on the consistency concept of Dubois and Prade, a transformation of the probability into a possibility distribution is undertaken. Under possibility paradigm, a further feature selection in the possibility space using the Shapely index.

Cluster Analysis: Unsupervised Classification for Identifying Benign and Malignant Tumors on Whole Slide Image of Prostate Cancer,"Recently, many fields have widely used cluster analysis: psychology, biology, statistics, pattern recognition, information retrieval, machine learning, and data mining. Diagnosis of histopathological images of prostate cancer is one of the routine tasks for pathologists and it is challenging for pathologists to analyze the formation of glands and tumors based on the Gleason grading system. In this study, unsupervised classification has been performed for differentiating malignant (cancerous) from benign (non-cancerous) tumors. Therefore, the unsupervised-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique would be of great benefit in easing the workloads of pathologists. This technique is used to find meaningful clustering objects (i.e., individuals, entities, patterns, or cases) and identify useful patterns. Radiomic-based features were extracted for cluster analysis using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM), and gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM) techniques. Multi-clustering techniques used for the unsupervised classification are K-means clustering, K-medoids clustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical (AH) clustering, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering, and Spectral clustering. The quality of the clustering algorithms was determined using Purity, Silhouettes, Adjusted Rand, Fowlkes Mallows, and Calinski Harabasz (CH) scores.

Detection of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Subtypes using YOLO and Mask R-CNN,"White Blood Cell (WBC) detection and counting on Microscopic Blood Cell images automatically can support expertise in diagnosing Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) more easily and quickly. Previous research commonly uses conventional approaches for ALL subtype detection that needs several stages, such as WBC segmentation, touch cell separation, feature extraction, and classification. We present object detection and instance segmentation techniques that require only one learning framework without needing separate stages. In this paper, we compare the performance of the YOLO and Mask R-CNN models for the detection of ALL subtypes using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1, and mAP. The results show that the YOLOv4 outperforms YOLOv5 and Mask R-CNN in the detection of ALL subtypes.

Research on Optimization of cell Nucleus Image Segmentation based on U-Net,"To solve the problem of low precision of nucleus segmentation in cell microscopic images, a method of nucleus segmentation based on deep learning is proposed. This paper presents a new network architecture Res18 U-Net++, which is based on the network framework of U-Net++ and introduces the residual module ResNet-18 and spatial attention mechanism. The network structure can make better use of the relationship between feature maps, and use set modules to enhance the reuse of feature information, thus improving the network performance.

Numerical calculation and experimental results show that this method can quickly and accurately achieve the segmentation of cell nucleus images, and achieve the effect of data enhancement. On this basis, the parameters of the model such as optimizer, loss function, learning rate, iteration value, and batch_size are modified and debugged, and images are preprocessed to try to increase image pixels to achieve better training results. In addition, the network framework proposed in this paper is compared with many network structures in the U-Net family, and the higher IoU value and smaller loss function show the advantages of the network framework proposed in this paper.

Nuclei Segmentation in ER-IHC Stained Histopathology Images using Mask R-CNN,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality among women in both developing and underdeveloped countries. The nuclei segmentation in digital histopathology image analysis plays a crucial role in breast cancer in the early stages of its development and may allow patients to have proper treatment. Nuclei overlap and complex structural organisation of the breast tissue in biopsy images make nuclei segmentation and feature extraction challenging. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, this paper employed a mask region-based convolution neural network (Mask R-CNN) to segment immunohistochemistry breast cancer images. The mask R-CNN algorithm introduces advanced Regional Proposal Network architecture that precisely addresses the object location to generate candidate regions. The Mask R-CNN used resnet50 as the backbone and applied Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to fully explore multiscale feature maps. And then, Region Proposal Network (RPN) was used to propose candidate bounding boxes. The robustness of the Mask R-CNN model is enhanced by training the model with our collected dataset. The proposed architecture has the average of 72% precision, 84.2% recall, 77.62% F1-score, and Jaccard Index overall score of 0.59.

DL-based Visual Interpretability over Medical Images using StyleGAN,"Interpretability of the underlying predictive models is essential to increase the usage of AI-based medical devices in clinical settings as they become more prevalent in imaging disciplines like radiology and histology.

Research on Urban Road Mean Speed Prediction Method Based on LSTM-CNN Model,"Urban road mean travel speed prediction is an important component of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). The mean road travel speeds are affected by the factors such as the time-varying traffic demand and the weather with fluctuation at the microscopic level. How to measure the influences of these factors and quantify them is a problem that needs to be solved. Hence, a combined model based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed to predict the hourly road mean speed, and a multivariate dataset containing multidimensional features that impact the mean travel speed is also used. While the LSTM is employed to learn the temporal dependence of the road mean speed sequence, the CNN is used to capture the spatial influences arising from the cross-sectional data. For improving the prediction accuracy, the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method was used to deal with the outliers representing the abnormal traffic condition among the cab data in city of Xi’an. The results of the comparative experiments show that a more accurate prediction of the hourly road mean speed can be achieved after removing the outliers and using multivariate dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the LSTM model in prediction accuracy measured by the R-Square, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the ConvLSTM model which has a spatio-temporal feature extraction capability.",Training;Roads;Urban areas;Time series analysis;Transportation;Predictive models;Feature extraction;ITS;mean speed prediction;deep learning;combined model;LSTM;CNN;MAD,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE 7th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Engineering (ICITE),10.1109/ICITE56321.2022.10101481
Hybrid Convolution-Transformer models for breast cancer classification using histopathological images,"Breast cancer threatens the public health as it is among the leading causes of women death due to unawareness and diagnosis at the late stages. The detection of this cancer in its early stage is decisive to decrease mortality rates . Deep learning techniques are effective in analysis of medical images and achieve high performance in detecting the abnormal features, and classify them. Therefore, these methods are becoming increasingly popular in breast cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for medical image analysis, but Vision transformers (ViTs ) are becoming more popular due to their excellent performance. However, ViTs still fall behind state-of-the-art convolutional networks. To overcome these limitations, many researchers have proposed a new approach that combines the advantages of CNNs and Transformers. This new approach overcomes the limitations of each by extracting low-level features, strengthening locality, and establishing long-range dependencies. In this study, the Hybrid Conv-Transformer approach was used to extract features from the BreakHis dataset of histopathological images. Coatnet and ConvMixer models were then used to classify the images into two binary classification based on both magnification-dependent and magnification-independent categories.

Unfortunately, these signs are not present in many cases and make it challenging to diagnose IBC. In this work, we proposed a pioneering framework of an M-Health system for early diagnosis of IBC to improve survival rates and presented the supporting preliminary experimental results. Particular emphasis is given to the system framework and bilateral mammography images. Since IBC is a rare type of cancer, there is currently no public-domain mammography image dataset.

Head and Neck Cancer Overall Survival Prognostication Using Dosiomic Features and Random Survival Forest Algorithm,"To move toward personalized therapy, the overall survival of poor prognosis cancers, such as head and neck (H&N) cancer, needs to be modeled with robust algorithms. The recently emerged radiomics approach uses quantitative features for predicting therapeutic responses. For cancer patients, radiotherapy provides 3D dose distribution. Encoding the embedded spatial information of dose distributions (called Dosiomics) can produce valuable features helpful for modeling prognostications. This study investigates the role of Radiomic and Dosiomic features in predicting the overall survival of H&N cancer patients after radiotherapy. We included 240 H&N cancer patients from five different institutions whose data was collected on the TCIA database. In total, 228 radiomic and Dosiomic features were retrieved from the GTVs including 79 first-order features and 136 three-dimensional texture features. Due to the significant role of clinical features in the prognosis of H&N cancer patients, we used 13 clinical features (gender, age, histology, smoking status, HPV status, T-staging, N-staging, TNM staging, primary tumor site, treatment modalities) alongside the radiomic and Dosiomic features. The random survival forest (RSF) machine learning (ML) model was employed in conjunction with five feature selection (FS) methods including C-Index, Variable hunting (VH), Variable hunting Variable Importance (VH. VIMP), Minimal Depth (MD), and Mutual Information (MI). The hyperparameters were optimized by grid search. Then concordance indices (C-Indices) were reported as the model performance quantification measured by 5-fold cross-validation for OS prediction. The best performance was achieved by combining RSF with MD (C-index=0.71) for the Dosiomics strategy. Moreover, the RSF, in a combination of VH. VIMP feature selection method achieved a C-index of 0.70 for the Radiomics strategy. This study showed that RSF algorithms trained by Dosiomic and radiomic features could significantly predict the survival and prognostication of H&N cancer patients. At the same time, the Dosiomics strategy have a stronger role in predicting overall survival.",Prediction algorithms;Magnetic heads;Neck;Radiation therapy;Prognostics and health management;Cancer;Radiomics;Radiomics;Dosiomics;head and neck cancer;overall survival,INPROCEEDINGS,2022,2022 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC),10.1109/NSS/MIC44845.2022.10399309

Peripheral Blood Smear Analysis Using Automated Computer-Aided Diagnosis System to Identify Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of cells caused due to the rapid increase of abnormal cells that later interfere with healthy cells. One of the main reasons for the increase in mortality is the cost of the devices used for the determination and late diagnosis. The most effective treatment option can be provided by accurate medical diagnosis. Automated segmentation of blood smear images plays a crucial role in the identification of the AML. This article proposes a new computer-aided diagnosis model to segment the blood smear images and identifies the stage of AML. The methodology presented in this work consists of various stages: Image acquisition, image segmentation, feature extraction/selection, and classification. The model is trained using 800 blood smear images collected from Kasturba Medical College Manipal, and 200 images collected from the dataset of microscopic peripheral blood cell images for the development of automatic recognition systems. The model is tested on 500 images. A novel algorithm is designed to accurately segment the blood smear images to identify AML and its stages. The segmentation algorithm addresses critical issues in blast cell detection, including identifying the blast cell and extracting the cytoplasm of the cell without involving manual intervention. It can identify the multiple lobes and the nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs), separate the overlapped erythrocytes from white blood cells (WBCs), and discover the presence of Auer rods and granules. The feature selection is performed using the InfoGainAttributeEval and the ranker search method. This article compares the performance of the various machine learning algorithms exploited for the classification of different types of cells and hence determines AML. The model successfully differentiated between NRBC and WBC with an accuracy of 99.81%. The model obtained a classification accuracy of 99.48 %.

Nowadays, multi-modal data, such as histopathological images and gene data, have advanced this field by providing histologic phenotype and genotype information. However, how to efficiently fuse and select the complementary information of high-dimensional multi-modal data remains challenging for Cox model, as it generally does not equip with feature fusion/selection mechanism. Many previous studies typically perform feature fusion/selection in the original feature space before Cox modeling. Alternatively, learning a latent shared feature space that is tailored for Cox model and simultaneously keeps sparsity is desirable. In addition, existing Cox-based models commonly pay little attention to the actual length of the observed time that may help to boost the model’s performance. In this article, we propose a novel Cox-driven multi-constraint latent representation learning framework for prognosis analysis with multi-modal data. Specifically, for efficient feature fusion, a multi-modal latent space is learned via a bi-mapping approach under ranking and regression constraints. The ranking constraint utilizes the log-partial likelihood of Cox model to induce learning discriminative representations in a task-oriented manner. Meanwhile, the representations also benefit from regression constraint, which imposes the supervision of specific survival time on representation learning. To improve generalization and alleviate overfitting, we further introduce similarity and sparsity constraints to encourage extra consistency and sparseness. Extensive experiments on three datasets acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art Cox-based models.",Prognostics and health management;Feature extraction;Cancer;Predictive models;Data models;Biological system modeling;Medical diagnostic imaging;Cox;human cancers;latent representation learning;multi-constraint;prognosis analysis,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3112194
Comparative Analysis of Merge Trees Using Local Tree Edit Distance,"Comparative analysis of scalar fields is an important problem with various applications including feature-directed visualization and feature tracking in time-varying data. Comparing topological structures that are abstract and succinct representations of the scalar fields lead to faster and meaningful comparison. While there are many distance or similarity measures to compare topological structures in a global context, there are no known measures for comparing topological structures locally. While the global measures have many applications, they do not directly lend themselves to fine-grained analysis across multiple scales. We define a local variant of the tree edit distance and apply it towards local comparative analysis of merge trees with support for finer analysis. We also present experimental results on time-varying scalar fields, 3D cryo-electron microscopy data, and other synthetic data sets to show the utility of this approach in applications like symmetry detection and feature tracking.",Isosurfaces;Feature extraction;Costs;Measurement;Transforms;Indexes;Image color analysis;Merge tree;scalar field;local distance measure;persistence;edit distance;symmetry detection;feature tracking,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,10.1109/TVCG.2021.3122176
Semisupervised Boundary Detection for Aluminum Grains Combined With Transfer Learning and Region Growing,"In the manufacturing process of aluminum alloy, the size, distribution, and shape of microscopic grains indicate the mechanical characteristics and product quality. However, for metallographic images that can reveal microstructures, the cost of expert labeling at pixel level is high. To solve the problem, we propose a semisupervised learning strategy for grain boundary detection with a few labeled images and abundant unlabeled samples. To expand the helpful information, transfer learning and rule-based region growing are considered. Specifically, a deep network used for extracting multiscale features is designed. With constant training, through a few labeled metallographic images and abundant transferred natural images, pseudo annotations are generated gradually for unlabeled metallographic images iteratively by feature similarity and boundary region growing. The increased unlabeled samples with their pseudo annotations would be involved in the following training process in semisupervised self-training mode to improve the generalization ability of model, together with the domain adaptation block. In experiments, the proposed two methods named semiricher convolutional features-generative adversarial networks (SemiRCF-GAN) and semiricher convolutional features-maximum mean discrepancy (SemiRCF-MMD) can effectively detect grain boundaries with only one labeled metallographic image, and achieve F1 scores of 0.73 and 0.72, respectively, which surpass typical methods.",Feature extraction;Task analysis;Data models;Transfer learning;Adaptation models;Training;Microstructure;Grain boundary detection;region growing;semisupervised learning;transfer learning,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3133760
Artificial Intelligence-Driven Image Analysis of Bacterial Cells and Biofilms,"The current study explores an artificial intelligence framework for measuring the structural features from microscopy images of the bacterial biofilms. Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 (DA-G20) grown on mild steel surfaces is used as a model for sulfate reducing bacteria that are implicated in microbiologically influenced corrosion problems. Our goal is to automate the process of extracting the geometrical properties of the DA-G20 cells from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which is otherwise a laborious and costly process. These geometric properties are a biofilm phenotype that allow us to understand how the biofilm structurally adapts to the surface properties of the underlying metals, which can lead to better corrosion prevention solutions. We adapt two deep learning models: (a) a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to achieve semantic segmentation of the cells, (d) a mask region-convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) model to achieve instance segmentation of the cells. These models are then integrated with moment invariants approach to measure the geometric characteristics of the segmented cells. Our numerical studies confirm that the Mask-RCNN and DCNN methods are 227x and 70x faster respectively, compared to the traditional method of manual identification and measurement of the cell geometric properties by the domain experts.",Microorganisms;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Biological system modeling;Microscopy;Deep learning;Sulfate-reducing bacteria;biofilms;deep learning for microscopy;biofilm image segmentation,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3138304
Superadditivity and Convex Optimization for Globally Optimal Cell Segmentation Using Deformable Shape Models,"Cell nuclei segmentation is challenging due to shape variation and closely clustered or partially overlapping objects. Most previous methods are not globally optimal, limited to elliptical models, or are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a globally optimal approach based on deformable shape models and global energy minimization for cell nuclei segmentation and cluster splitting. We propose an implicit parameterization of deformable shape models and show that it leads to a convex energy. Convex energy minimization yields the global solution independently of the initialization, is fast, and robust. To jointly perform cell nuclei segmentation and cluster splitting, we developed a novel iterative global energy minimization method, which leverages the inherent property of superadditivity of the convex energy. This property exploits the lower bound of the energy of the union of the models and improves the computational efficiency. Our method provably determines a solution close to global optimality. In addition, we derive a closed-form solution of the proposed global minimization based on the superadditivity property for non-clustered cell nuclei. We evaluated our method using fluorescence microscopy images of five different cell types comprising various challenges, and performed a quantitative comparison with previous methods.

Transport-Based Anatomical-Functional Metric Learning for Liver Tumor Recognition Using Dual-View Dynamic CEUS Imaging,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are the most common malignancy arising from primary liver cancer (PLC). Liver ultrasound (US) has been the main approach for the early screening and differential diagnosis. Since ultrasonic findings of PLC are closely associated with tumor growth pattern, histological morphology, tumor staging, and other factors, ultrasonic imaging findings overlap partially. Besides, qualitative assessment is highly dependent on expertise. To improve the diagnostic objectiveness, we propose a novel transport-based anatomical-functional metric learning (T-AFML) method to quantify imaging similarity of both the gray-scale US and dynamic contrast-enhanced US view. Considering that the hemodynamic changes vary with individuals, we introduce a temporally regularized optimal transport to align the local enhancement patterns automatically. To sufficiently exploit ultrasonic findings similarity from different modalities, a selector-based metric integration mechanism is adopted to adaptively select a dominant modality accounting for the similarity measure. In this retrospective study, we collected a total of 174 liver cancer patients consists of 105 HCC and 69 ICC, and our method achieves the superior diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of 88.41% and 86.16%, respectively, demonstrating its efficacy in quantifying multi-modal ultrasonic findings similarity for PLC diagnosis.",Liver;Measurement;Gray-scale;Cancer;Acoustics;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Morphology;Imaging similarity measure;optimal transport;primary liver cancer;temporal alignment,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,10.1109/TBME.2022.3207473
Two Path Gland Segmentation Algorithm of Colon Pathological Image Based on Local Semantic Guidance,"Colonic adenocarcinoma is a disease severely endangering human life caused by mucosal epidermal carcinogenesis. The segmentation of potentially cancerous glands is the key in the detection and diagnosis of colonic adenocarcinoma. The appearance of cancerous tissue is different in gland segmentation in colon pathological images, and it is impossible to accurately segment the changes of glands from benign to malignant using a single network. Given these issues, a two-path gland segmentation algorithm of colon pathological image based on local semantic guidance is proposed in this paper. The improved candidate region search algorithm is adopted to expand the original image data set and generate sub-datasets sensitive to specific features. Then, the semantic feature-guided model is employed to extract the local adenocarcinoma features and acts on the backbone network together with context feature extraction based on the attention mechanism. In this way, a larger receptive field and more local feature information are obtained, the learning ability of the network to the morphological features of glands is enhanced, and the performance of automatic gland segmentation is finally improved. The algorithm is verified on Warwick Qu-Dataset. Compared with the current popular segmentation algorithms, our algorithm has good performance in Dice coefficient, F1 score, and Hausdorff distance on different types of test sets.",Glands;Image segmentation;Pathology;Cancer;Shape;Feature extraction;Semantics;Colonic adenocarcinoma;semantics guided;candidate region;gland segmentation,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3207874
An Efficient Detection and Classification of Acute Leukemia Using Transfer Learning and Orthogonal Softmax Layer-Based Model,"For the early diagnosis of hematological disorders like blood cancer, microscopic analysis of blood cells is very important. Traditional deep CNNs lead to overfitting when it receives small medical image datasets such as ALLIDB1, ALLIDB2, and ASH. This paper proposes a new and effective model for classifying and detecting Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) that delivers excellent performance in small medical datasets. Here, we have proposed a novel Orthogonal SoftMax Layer (OSL)-based Acute Leukemia detection model that consists of ResNet 18-based deep feature extraction followed by efficient OSL-based classification. Here, OSL is integrated with the ResNet18 to improve the classification performance by making the weight vectors orthogonal to each other. Hence, it integrates ResNet benefits (residual learning and identity mapping) with the benefits of OSL-based classification (improvement of feature discrimination capability and computational efficiency). Furthermore, we have introduced extra dropout and ReLu layers in the architecture to achieve a faster network with enhanced performance.

A Compound Loss Function With Shape Aware Weight Map for Microscopy Cell Segmentation,"Microscopy cell segmentation is a crucial step in biological image analysis and a challenging task. In recent years, deep learning has been widely used to tackle this task, with promising results. A critical aspect of training complex neural networks for this purpose is the selection of the loss function, as it affects the learning process. In the field of cell segmentation, most of the recent research in improving the loss function focuses on addressing the problem of inter-class imbalance. Despite promising achievements, more work is needed, as the challenge of cell segmentation is not only the inter-class imbalance but also the intra-class imbalance (the cost imbalance between the false positives and false negatives of the inference model), the segmentation of cell minutiae, and the missing annotations. To deal with these challenges, in this paper, we propose a new compound loss function employing a shape aware weight map. The proposed loss function is inspired by Youden’s J index to handle the problem of inter-class imbalance and uses a focal cross-entropy term to penalize the intra-class imbalance and weight easy/hard samples. The proposed shape aware weight map can handle the problem of missing annotations and facilitate valid segmentation of cell minutiae. Results of evaluations on all ten 2D+time datasets from the public cell tracking challenge demonstrate 1) the superiority of the proposed loss function with the shape aware weight map, and 2) that the performance of recent deep learning-based cell segmentation methods can be improved by using the proposed compound loss function.",Image segmentation;Shape;Microscopy;Computer architecture;Compounds;Microprocessors;Annotations;Microscopy cell segmentation;deep learning;compound loss function;shape aware weight map,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2022.3226226
A Multi-Scale Context Aware Attention Model for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation is critical for efficient diagnosis of diseases and treatment planning. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based methods, particularly U-Net and its variants, have achieved remarkable results on medical image segmentation tasks. However, they do not always work consistently on images with complex structures and large variations in regions of interest (ROI). This could be due to the fixed geometric structure of the receptive fields used for feature extraction and repetitive down-sampling operations that lead to information loss. To overcome these problems, the standard U-Net architecture is modified in this work by replacing the convolution block with a dilated convolution block to extract multi-scale context features with varying sizes of receptive fields, and adding a dilated inception block between the encoder and decoder paths to alleviate the problem of information recession and the semantic gap between features. Furthermore, the input of each dilated convolution block is added to the output through a squeeze and excitation unit, which alleviates the vanishing gradient problem and improves overall feature representation by re-weighting the channel-wise feature responses. The original inception block is modified by reducing the size of the spatial filter and introducing dilated convolution to obtain a larger receptive field. The proposed network was validated on three challenging medical image segmentation tasks with varying size ROIs: lung segmentation on chest X-ray (CXR) images, skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopy images and nucleus segmentation on microscopy cell images. Improved performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates the effectiveness and generalisability of the proposed Dilated Convolution and Inception blocks-based U-Net (DCI-UNet).",Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Convolution;Standards;Task analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semantics;Multi-scale context;dilated convolution;dilated inception;medical image segmentation;U-Net;squeeze and excitation unit;attention,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3227540

Cancer Survival Prediction From Whole Slide Images With Self-Supervised Learning and Slide Consistency,"Histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) at giga-pixel resolution are the gold standard for cancer analysis and prognosis. Due to the scarcity of pixel- or patch-level annotations of WSIs, many existing methods attempt to predict survival outcomes based on a three-stage strategy that includes patch selection, patch-level feature extraction and aggregation. However, the patch features are usually extracted by using truncated models (e.g. ResNet) pretrained on ImageNet without fine-tuning on WSI tasks, and the aggregation stage does not consider the many-to-one relationship between multiple WSIs and the patient. In this paper, we propose a novel survival prediction framework that consists of patch sampling, feature extraction and patient-level survival prediction. Specifically, we employ two kinds of self-supervised learning methods, i.e. colorization and cross-channel, as pretext tasks to train convnet-based models that are tailored for extracting features from WSIs. Then, at the patient-level survival prediction we explicitly aggregate features from multiple WSIs, using consistency and contrastive losses to normalize slide-level features at the patient level. We conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets: TCGA-GBM, TCGA-LUSC and NLST. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, as it achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with previous studies, with concordance index of 0.670, 0.679 and 0.711 on TCGA-GBM, TCGA-LUSC and NLST, respectively.",Feature extraction;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Cancer;Annotations;Self-supervised learning;Training;Whole slide images;survival prediction;self-supervised learning;deep learning,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2022.3228275
Knowledge Distillation in Histology Landscape by Multi-Layer Features Supervision,"Automatic tissue classification is a fundamental task in computational pathology for profiling tumor micro-environments. Deep learning has advanced tissue classification performance at the cost of significant computational power. Shallow networks have also been end-to-end trained using direct supervision however their performance degrades because of the lack of capturing robust tissue heterogeneity. Knowledge distillation has recently been employed to improve the performance of the shallow networks used as student networks by using additional supervision from deep neural networks used as teacher networks. In the current work, we propose a novel knowledge distillation algorithm to improve the performance of shallow networks for tissue phenotyping in histology images. For this purpose, we propose multi-layer feature distillation such that a single layer in the student network gets supervision from multiple teacher layers. In the proposed algorithm, the size of the feature map of two layers is matched by using a learnable multi-layer perceptron. The distance between the feature maps of the two layers is then minimized during the training of the student network. The overall objective function is computed by summation of the loss over multiple layers combination weighted with a learnable attention-based parameter. The proposed algorithm is named as Knowledge Distillation for Tissue Phenotyping (KDTP). Experiments are performed on five different publicly available histology image classification datasets using several teacher-student network combinations within the KDTP algorithm. Our results demonstrate a significant performance increase in the student networks by using the proposed KDTP algorithm compared to direct supervision-based training methods.",Cancer;Training;Knowledge engineering;Histopathology;Task analysis;Predictive models;Neural networks;Knowledge distillation;features distillation;histology image classification;tissue phenotyping,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3237749
Parameter Extraction for the Degradation of On-Board Arrester in High-Speed Railway Under Effects of Multiple Strokes,"On-board arrester (OBA) is an essential equipment of electric multiple units (EMUs), and its working condition will directly affect the reliable operation of EMU. Simultaneously, due to frequent multiple strokes (MSs), OBA suffers from accelerated impulse deterioration and serious life threatening. Thus, this article extracts the feature parameters for degraded OBA under effects of MS. First, an experiment platform is established to perform the MS experiment. The dc parameters and frequency-domain dielectric spectroscopy (FDS) parameters of OBA are then measured. Subsequently, the measured data and the reliability of experimental results are discussed. Finally, microscopic feature parameters [i.e., barrier height (BH) and depletion layer width (DLW)] and dielectric feature parameters of OBA are extracted, and their effectiveness is verified (the maximum and mean of absolute relative error are merely 5.14% and 2.76%, respectively). The results demonstrate that: 1) with increasing MS aging, DLW and BH descend gradually, and after 30 MSs, the maximum decreases are 64.5% and 82.28%, respectively; 2) the geometric capacitance and third polarized branch capacitance ascends exponentially with the deepening of impulse aging, while the insulation resistance and relaxation time constants drop exponentially; and 3) several microscopic and dielectric feature parameters are extracted to effectively evaluate the degradation state of OBA.",Arresters;Aging;Zinc oxide;II-VI semiconductor materials;Surges;Feature extraction;Lightning;Frequency-domain dielectric spectroscopy (FDS);feature parameters;high-speed train;impulse deterioration;multiple strokes (MSs);on-board arrester (OBA),ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2023.3238057
Modality Specific CBAM-VGGNet Model for the Classification of Breast Histopathology Images via Transfer Learning,"Histopathology images are very distinctive, one image may contain thousands of objects. Transferring features from natural images to histopathology images may not provide impressive outcomes. In this study, we have proposed a novel modality specific CBAM-VGGNet model for classifying H and E stained breast histopathology images. Instead of using pre-trained models on ImageNet, we have trained VGG16 and VGG19 models on the same domain cancerous histopathology datasets, which are then used as fixed feature extractors. We have added the GAP layer and Convolutional block attention module (CBAM) after the first convolutional layer of convolutional blocks. CBAM is an effective module for neural networks to focus on relevant features. We have implemented the VGG16 and VGG19 in a novel way following the configuration of state-of-the-art models with our own concatenated layers. The addition of the GAP layer in VGGNet has reduced the number of parameters, requiring less computational power. Both models are ensembled using the averaging ensemble technique. Features are extracted from the final ensembled model and then passed to the feed-forward neural network. A hybrid pre-processing technique is proposed that first uses a median filter and then contrasts limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The median filter removes the highly significant noise and is directly related to image quality. CLAHE improves the local contrast present in an image and boosts the weak boundary edges in each image pixel. The proposed CBAM ensemble model has outperformed state-of-the-art models with an accuracy of 98.96% and 97.95% F1-score on 400X data of the BreakHis dataset.",Histopathology;Feature extraction;Transfer learning;Breast cancer;Convolutional neural networks;Computational modeling;Deep learning;Breast cancer;CBAM;CLAHE;classification;deep learning;histopathology;transfer learning,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3245023
Development of Prognostic Biomarkers by TMB-Guided WSI Analysis: A Two-Step Approach,"The rapid development of computational pathology has brought new opportunities for prognosis prediction using histopathological images. However, the existing deep learning frameworks lack exploration of the relationship between images and other prognostic information, resulting in poor interpretability. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a promising biomarker for predicting the survival outcomes of cancer patients, but its measurement is costly. Its heterogeneity may be reflected in histopathological images. Here, we report a two-step framework for prognostic prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs). First, the framework adopts a deep residual network to encode the phenotype of WSIs and classifies patient-level TMB by the deep features after aggregation and dimensionality reduction. Then, the patients' prognosis is stratified by the TMB-related information obtained during the classification model development. Deep learning feature extraction and TMB classification model construction are performed on an in-house dataset of 295 Haematoxylin & Eosin stained WSIs of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The development and evaluation of prognostic biomarkers are performed on The Cancer Genome Atlas-Kidney ccRCC (TCGA-KIRC) project with 304 WSIs. Our framework achieves good performance for TMB classification with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.813 on the validation set. Through survival analysis, our proposed prognostic biomarkers can achieve significant stratification of patients' overall survival (P $< $ 0.05) and outperform the original TMB signature in risk stratification of patients with advanced disease. The results indicate the feasibility of mining TMB-related information from WSI to achieve stepwise prognosis prediction.",Cancer;Biomarkers;Prognostics and health management;Bioinformatics;Sequential analysis;Tumors;Predictive models;Feature extraction;prognostic biomarker;tumor mutation burden (TMB);whole-slide image (WSI),ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3249354
Triplet-Net Classification of Contiguous Stem Cell Microscopy Images,"Cellular microscopy imaging is a common form of data acquisition for biological experimentation. Observation of gray-level morphological features allows for the inference of useful biological information such as cellular health and growth status. Cellular colonies can contain multiple cell types, making colony level classification very difficult. Additionally, cell types growing in a hierarchical, downstream fashion, can often look visually similar, although biologically distinct. In this paper, it is determined empirically that traditional deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and classical object recognition techniques are not sufficient to distinguish between these subtle visual differences, resulting in misclassifications. Instead, Triplet-net CNN learning is employed in a hierarchical classification scheme to improve the ability of the model to discern distinct, fine-grain features of two commonly confused morphological image-patch classes, namely Dense and Spread colonies. The Triplet-net method improves classification accuracy over a four-class deep neural network by $\sim$∼ 3$\%$%, a value that was determined to be statistically significant, as well as existing state-of-the-art image patch classification approaches and standard template matching. These findings allow for the accurate classification of multi-class cell colonies with contiguous boundaries, and increased reliability and efficiency of automated, high-throughput experimental quantification using non-invasive microscopy.",Stem cells;Biology;Microscopy;Training;Feature extraction;Neurons;Morphology;Deep learning;induced pluripotent stem cells;triplet-net,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,10.1109/TCBB.2023.3247957
Automated Hooking of Biomedical Microelectrode Guided by Intelligent Microscopic Vision,"Biomedical microelectrode implantation is a promising approach to achieve invasive brain-machine interface with high bandwidth and good biocompatibility. However, it is difficult to manipulate a microelectrode probe because of its micron-level width and flexible material. Toward the challenging robotic implantation, this article addresses an essential operation step: automated hooking of flexible microelectrode probe with a micro-needle. First, a point-contour of interest extraction network for microscopic image (MicroPCIE) is proposed to obtain key image features for visual guidance. Based on few-shot learning mechanism, MicroPCIE trained on nonspecific dataset can be rapidly deployed to the specific hooking task without requiring data-driven optimization. Second, a robotic hooking control system is designed considering the distributed probe locations, variable needle direction, and efficiency requirements. The needle-probe alignment control is executed under low and high microscope magnifications, to realize larger operation range and permit high alignment precision. The optical design and camera aiming control are proposed to guarantee the visibility and clearness of objects after low-to-high magnification switch. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with a series of experiments.",Feature extraction;Probes;Needles;Microscopy;Microelectrodes;Task analysis;Cameras;Brain-machine interface (BMI);few-shot learning;flexible electrode;micromanipulation;microscopic vision,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,10.1109/TMECH.2023.3248112
FAM3L: Feature-Aware Multi-Modal Metric Learning for Integrative Survival Analysis of Human Cancers,"Survival analysis is to estimate the survival time for an individual or a group of patients, which is a valid solution for cancer treatments. Recent studies suggested that the integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data can better predict the survival of cancer patients than simply using single bio-marker, for different bio-markers may provide complementary information. However, for the given multi-modal data that may contain irrelevant or redundant features, it is still challenge to design a distance metric that can simultaneously discover significant features and measure the difference of survival time among different patients. To solve this issue, we propose a Feature-Aware Multi-modal Metric Learning method (FAM3L), which not only learns the metric for distance constraints on patients’ survival time, but also identifies important images and genomic features for survival analysis. Specifically, for each modality of data, we firstly design one feature-aware metric that can be decoupled into a traditional distance metric and a diagonal weight for important feature identification. Then, in order to explore the complex correlation across multiple modality data, we apply Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to jointly learn multiple metrics. Finally, based on the learned distance metrics, we apply the Cox proportional hazards model for prognosis prediction. We evaluate the performance of our proposed FAM3L method on three cancer cohorts derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the experimental results demonstrate that our method can not only achieve superior performance for cancer prognosis, but also identify meaningful image and genomic features correlating strongly with cancer survival.",Measurement;Cancer;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Feature extraction;Imaging;Prognostics and health management;Imaging genomics;feature-aware metric learning;Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion;prognostic bio-marker identification,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2023.3262024
Breast Cancer Detection Using ResNet with Hyperparameter Tuning,"There are more than 2 million new cases of breast cancer each year, which is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early diagnosis improves cure rates and reduces mortality and misdiagnosis. However, a common way to diagnose breast cancer is based on mammographic images, which may misdiagnose. In this paper, a convolutional neural network with a pre-trained Residual Neural Network (ResNet) is proposed to diagnose breast cancer based on histology images. The proposed model employs ResNet to extract features from the images, then classify them into benign or malignant. Then a hyperparameter tuning process using the hyperband algorithm is applied to find the optimal hyperparameters in the model. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the default model is compared with the models from tuning results using the histopathological images from other datasets. The comparison result is based on the AUC, ROC, validation accuracy, and validation loss. The experimental results demonstrate that the best-modified model has a 99.63 percent of validation accuracy. The analyses illustrate that the modified ResNet model performs better on detect breast cancer based on histopathological images than the default model.",Analytical models;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Power electronics;Hybrid power systems;Breast Cancer;Convolutional Neural Network;Residual Neural Network;Deep Learning;Hyperparameter Tuning;Histopathological Images;Binary Classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"2023 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Power, Electronics and Computer Applications (ICPECA)",10.1109/ICPECA56706.2023.10076197
Toward Source-Free Cross Tissues Histopathological Cell Segmentation via Target-Specific Finetuning,"Recognition and quantitative analytics of histopathological cells are the golden standard for diagnosing multiple cancers. Despite recent advances in deep learning techniques that have been widely investigated for the automated segmentation of various types of histopathological cells, the heavy dependency on specific histopathological image types with sufficient supervised annotations, as well as the limited access to clinical data in hospitals, still pose significant challenges in the application of computer-aided diagnosis in pathology. In this paper, we focus on the model generalization of cell segmentation towards cross-tissue histopathological images. Remarkably, a novel target-specific finetuning-based self-supervised domain adaptation framework is proposed to transfer the cell segmentation model to unlabeled target datasets, without access to source datasets and annotations. When performed on the target unlabeled histopathological image set, the proposed method only needs to tune very few parameters of the pre-trained model in a self-supervised manner. Considering the morphological properties of pathological cells, we introduce two constraint terms at both local and global levels into this framework to access more reliable predictions. The proposed cross-domain framework is validated on three different types of histopathological tissues, showing promising performance in self-supervised cell segmentation. Additionally, the whole framework can be further applied to clinical tools in pathology without accessing the original training image data.

Automated Nuclei Analysis from Digital Histopathology,"In Histopathology analysis, an abnormal nuclear shape can be a strong parameter to detect malignancy. Similarly, by visualizing the growing amount of nuclei implies disease status such as grading of cancer. In clinical diagnosis there is a link between texture of the nucleus and disease current status. In digital pathology the most crucial & important step for computer-aided diagnostics system is automated cell nuclei segmentation. Regular studies are going on digital pathology for automatic analyzing the nuclei cell images. However, providing accurate cell nucleus segmentation rate through automation is still poor. Scientists are rigorously working on the development of computerized segmentation algorithm to provide faster diagnosis. This paper proposed a novel thresholding based unsupervised technique which is applicable to detect nuclei contours. Proposed approach is applied to seven multi organ histological tissue images. Threshold is calculated by taking into consideration the first nonzero gray level pixel value followed by finding the pixel connectivity with 8 neighborhood concept. Furthermore, the various nuclei feature including mean intensity, diameter, perimeter, centroid is computed to get better insight to cell functionality providing a support in early diagnosis to diseases. When compare with traditional adaptive thresholding this approach achieved better performance rate by 48.31 %.",Training;Image segmentation;Visualization;Thresholding (Imaging);Histopathology;Shape;Medical treatment;Histopathology;Nuclei;Threshold;8 neighborhood;Contour;Cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"2023 International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Advanced Computing and Communication (ISACC)",10.1109/ISACC56298.2023.10083938
Automated Detection of Breast Cancer using Artificial Intelligence Systems,"The second leading cause of death for women worldwide remains breast cancer. In particular as they age, all women have a higher risk of acquiring breast cancer. Populations range in their incidence of various forms of breast cancer, and they also differ in their risks of developing breast cancer in general. Hence, it is crucial to determine the degree of the malignancy as soon as possible. Artificial intelligence may be able to classify breast cancer with competence levels on par with those of a doctor. This paper proposes the detection of breast cancer through a deep learning algorithm-based approach that involves segmentation, feature extraction, and grading. A soft computing technique is developed to categorize tumours as benign or malignant using breast histopathology images. To determine the exact grades of breast cancer, the initiation technique uses K-mean clustering-based segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The segmented region yielded attributes such as correlation, homogeneity, contrast, LBPs (local binary patterns), and energy coefficients. In order to establish which network is better at recognizing the diagnosis of breast malignancy, the Artificial neural network classifier, deep learning architectures of AlexNet and GoogLeNet are contrasted. The AlexNet classification methodology produces accurate solutions than other methods by obtaining 100% accuracy. The proposed enhanced segmentation and classification techniques may help the automated diagnosis system to reduce the number of erroneous diagnoses and increase prediction performance. It could therefore aid clinicians in obtaining an additional opinion and in the early detection of diseases.",Deep learning;Image segmentation;Histopathology;Artificial neural networks;Medical services;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Breast malignance;preprocessing;segmentation;Histopathological breast images;AlexNet;GoogLeNet,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Discovery in Concurrent Engineering (ICECONF),10.1109/ICECONF57129.2023.10083873
Detection of Cancer in Human Blood Sample using Machine Learning,"The process of identifying blood problems involves a human being looking at a blood sample under a microscope with their unaided eyes. In this study, a computerized method was created to aid doctors in recognizing various forms of leukaemia. Initial segmentation is performed using K-Mean clustering once the RGB image has been transformed to L*a*b color space. The properties of this clustered image are extracted and divided into various forms of leukaemia. This method is used to recognize the illnesses and provide an early diagnosis. Since images are inexpensive and don't require any expensive testing or lab equipment, they are used as inputs. In order to investigate any changes in colour, texture, geometry, and statistical analysis of the images, this research will make use of features in microscopic photographs. Proposed method will feed the changes discovered in these features into our classifier. Since images are inexpensive and don't require expensive testing or lab equipment, they are used. Leukemia, a disease of white blood cells, will be the system's main focus.

Diagnosis of Vitamin Deficiency in Human Beings using DNN Algorithm,"The proposed RCNN-based classification system for vitamin deficiency in skin surface microscopy images involves several important steps. The first step is to extract relevant features from the images, which in this case will be border/edge information obtained through the use of Blur Trace (BT) techniques. The BT analysis is a powerful tool for extracting meaningful information from images, and it has been shown to be effective in pattern recognition tasks similar to the one being proposed here. The next step in the process is to perform preprocessing on the images to remove unwanted elements such as hair and noise. This is achieved through the use of nonlinear filtering, specifically median filtering, which has been chosen for its superior performance compared to linear filtering methods. The filtered images are then analyzed to extract energy characteristics that are used to accurately categorize the patterns of vitamin deficiency present in the images. The final stage of the system is the classification of the dermoscopy image into one of the predefined categories, such as Normal, Benign, or Malignant. This is accomplished through the use of the RCNN, which has been trained on the features extracted from the images. The RCNN is a highly advanced machine learning algorithm that has been shown to perform well in a wide range of pattern recognition tasks, making it an ideal choice for this application. The ultimate goal of this research is to contribute to the field of dermatology by improving the accuracy of diagnosing vitamin deficiency and enhancing therapy efficacy through the use of cutting-edge imaging technology. By combining the power of the RCNN with the capabilities of the BT analysis, it is expected that a highly accurate and effective classification system will be developed, which will benefit patients and healthcare practitioners alike.",Maximum likelihood detection;Sensitivity;Filtering;Support vector machine classification;Transforms;Feature extraction;Skin;Skin cancer;Multi-resolution analysis;Support vector machine;Medical image classification;Bendlet Transform,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 Second International Conference on Electronics and Renewable Systems (ICEARS),10.1109/ICEARS56392.2023.10085334
Altered Neural Net for Breast Histological Image Categorization,"Manual diagnosis of histopathological breast images is both time-taking and inaccurate process. Breast-cancer Computerized Diagnosis (BCD) using the Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) tissue attained from biopsy relies on the efficiency and accuracy of the process. Accuracy of the conventional classification methods depend on extracted features. To conquer the difficulties of traditional feature-based techniques, deep-learning approaches are preferred as an alternative in attaining accurate classification. Deep Altered-Convolutional Neural Network (A-CNN) for categorization of HE breast tissue images as Benign/Malignant is stated. Network architecture of A-CNN is intended to gain information at nuclei and overall tissue levels. Extracted features from A-CNN are used to train the Multi-Class SVM (MC-SVM) classifier. The cascaded categorization method accomplished better accuracy of 94.16 % and a best AUC of 0.913 than the individual ones.",Support vector machines;Sensitivity;Level set;Neural networks;Biopsy;Manuals;Breast tissue;Image Classification;Computer-Aided Analysis;Support-Vector Machine;Neural Networks,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"2023 International Conference on Intelligent and Innovative Technologies in Computing, Electrical and Electronics (IITCEE)",10.1109/IITCEE57236.2023.10091027
A Weakly Supervised Method With Colorization for Nuclei Segmentation Using Point Annotations,"Nuclei segmentation is an essential step in the automatic analysis of histopathology images. This segmentation task requires much work to manually generate accurate pixel-level annotations for fully supervised training. To overcome such expensive and hard-to-get pixel-level annotations, in this article, we propose a weakly supervised method for nuclei segmentation only using point annotations based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method effectively combines a weakly supervised segmentation task and an auxiliary colorization task. The dual input with boundaries and color information maximizes the inherent features of the image. Two types of coarse labels generated from point annotations are applied to provide constraint information for the segmentation task. As an auxiliary task, colorization is incorporated to guide the network to extract effective features and improve the segmentation performance of the network. We evaluate our proposed method on two public nuclei segmentation datasets. The experimental results indicate that our method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.",Annotations;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Task analysis;Histopathology;Training;Feature extraction;Colorization;deep learning;nuclei segmentation;point annotations;weakly supervised,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,10.1109/TIM.2023.3265124
Role of Image Analysis on Coke Strength Prediction: A Survey,"The metallurgical coke consists of different qualitative and quantitative properties. Qualitative properties defining the varied structure of a coke sample have visible influence on the strength of the coke and coke strength is a topic of study in view of its application areas. Image analysis provides a very reliable method for the quantification of these coke properties and establishes a direct link to the strength prediction of coke. With time, the different available microscopic imaging technologies have also evolved a lot and cater an extremely wide range of imaging requirements. The aim of this survey is to study the scope of image analysis in the field of the coke mineralogy. It tries to outline the properties of coke in two aspects, first are the established metrics that have been traditionally used to quantify the coke strength indexes and next are the qualitative properties engraving the structural complexity of coke.

A Brief Survey on Image Denoising based Feature Extraction and Classification Models for Oral Cancer Detection,"A subset of oral cancer is called Oropharyngeal Carcinoma (OPC). As opposed to other forms of oral cancer, this one seems to be fatal more often. Those with oropharyngeal cancer also have damage to their tonsils, the back of their tongues, and the vallecula. The oral cavity is frequently attacked by malignant tumours, and oral cancer is one of the most common types. Understanding the precise nature of the oral cancer at an early stage allows for more precise treatment planning and more accurate prediction of the patient’s response to therapy. Diagnosing oral cancer from histological pictures is a significant obstacle. Visual characteristics of oral cancers are typically gleaned from epithelial layer architecture and the presence of keratin pearls. Salivary glands, tonsils, and the jawline, face, and mouth are all affected by the tumour. In this research, a brief survey is presented on image denoising models, feature extraction models for accurate oral cancer detection. A deep learning algorithm and cutting-edge technology make it possible to discover and classify things at an early stage. Multiple filtering strategies are used here to get rid of the speckle noise in the CT image. Oropharyngeal carcinoma is often detected with CT scans. In this research, a deep learning systems are analyzed for application in the classification of oral pictures into normal and pathological categories.

High-Order Correlation-Guided Slide-Level Histology Retrieval With Self-Supervised Hashing,"Histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in cancer diagnosis. It is of significant importance for pathologists to search for images sharing similar content with the query WSI, especially in the case-based diagnosis. While slide-level retrieval could be more intuitive and practical in clinical applications, most methods are designed for patch-level retrieval. A few recently unsupervised slide-level methods only focus on integrating patch features directly, without perceiving slide-level information, and thus severely limits the performance of WSI retrieval. To tackle the issue, we propose a High-Order Correlation-Guided Self-Supervised Hashing-Encoding Retrieval (HSHR) method. Specifically, we train an attention-based hash encoder with slide-level representation in a self-supervised manner, enabling it to generate more representative slide-level hash codes of cluster centers and assign weights for each. These optimized and weighted codes are leveraged to establish a similarity-based hypergraph, in which a hypergraph-guided retrieval module is adopted to explore high-order correlations in the multi-pairwise manifold to conduct WSI retrieval. Extensive experiments on multiple TCGA datasets with over 24,000 WSIs spanning 30 cancer subtypes demonstrate that HSHR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised histology WSI retrieval methods.",Feature extraction;Histopathology;Codes;Correlation;Task analysis;Data mining;Biomedical imaging;Histopathological Whole Slide Image (WSI);computer-aided retrieval;slide-level;high-order correlation,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,10.1109/TPAMI.2023.3269810
Optimization of Micro-Object Identification by Correcting Distorted Image Points,"A methodology for optimizing the identification, recognition and classification of micro-objects has been implemented using dynamic models for transforming the original image, synthesizing mechanisms for extracting redundant information structures and using histological, morphological, and texture characteristics of images. Implemented mechanisms for detecting, highlighting and correcting the values of distorted points by embedding new data, segmenting the contour, reducing redundant fragments, and setting variables. Identification algorithms have been developed that take into account the correlations of a set of points, the dynamics of their change, matrices of coordinates of points, deformation of segments and the selection of homogeneous areas of images.

Machine Learning Thyroid Model for Prediction System,"Deep learning and cytopathology identification have trended in recent decades. Whole slide images (WSI) from clinic e-scanners help researchers classify slides (benign or malignant). In a thyroid WSI, the crucial area that supports the detection result may be smaller, and only the worldwide label may be gathered, making the supervised learning framework impracticable. Clinical thyroid cell identification requires many visual cues across several scales, therefore standard feature extraction may not work. This study proposes a poorly guided multi-instance-based learning technique for cytopathological thyroid diagnosis using Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSF) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). WSIs are pouches with numerous occurrences for each section. Architecture learns to automatically categorise important sections. A feature fusion architecture that merges minimum features in the feature map with an instance-level awareness model improves classification results. The suggested model, trained and verified on clinical data, outperforms all existing methods with 93.2% accuracy.

Dimensionality Reduction of Multivariate Images Using the Linear & Nonlinear Approach,"Multivariate imaging advanced in recent years which prompted many applications for detailed understanding in the fields of satellite imaging, medical imaging, and microscopic imaging. To achieve more insights about it, various feature extraction techniques exist which utilize the ample spectral and spatial details in an image. But apart from feature extraction dimensionality reduction (DR) and efficient classification has become a key aspect in multivariate image analysis (MIA). Adding more and more variables in feature space of multivariate image results into high dimensionality which in turn increases the complexity in classification. Therefore, it becomes important to apply DR techniques before classification process. Most widely used DR method is Principal component analysis (PCA) which is linear DR method. The main disadvantage of PCA is that it does not consider the nonlinearity in data. Local linear embedding (LLE) overcomes nonlinearity issue.

Continual Cell Instance Segmentation of Microscopy Images,"A continual cell instance segmenter aims to continually learn to segment new objects while preserving the ability to localize and distinguish old objects without access to previous data. Besides catastrophic forgetting, background shift, where the background class could contain objects in the old and unseen future classes, could occur. In addition, as acquiring annotations is label-intensive, cell images can be partially labeled. In this paper, we present iMRCNN, which extends Mask R-CNN with knowledge distillation and pseudo labeling, to address these challenges. To preserve the learned skills, the current student distills knowledge from the former teacher at output and feature levels. Furthermore, we employ a pseudo labeling scheme, where the teacher is utilized to identify objects with no labels provided, to deal with background shift and partially labeled data.

Classifying Pathological Images Based on Multi-Instance Learning and End-to-End Attention Pooling,"In order to address the issue that previous deep learning methods for classifying pathological images cannot adaptively learn features, we propose an end-to-end attention pooling method based on a multi-instance learning patch scoring model. Our method integrates feature extraction and classification into a unified framework that is conducive to extracting the most valuable features. In this model, a patch scoring method is constructed by a multi-instance learning method firstly and then the partial patches selected by the patches scoring model are classified using an end-to-end classification model that incorporates an attention pooled mechanism. To make the pathological image classification mechanism more compatible with the pathologist diagnosis method, we use the squared average normalization function instead of the softmax function to optimize the feature extraction and fusion process, so that the high score patches in positive pathological images receive more attention weights, thus giving better interpretability to the classification results. Experiments on publicly available datasets TCGA_BRCA show a significant improvement in the performance of our approach over other work.",Learning systems;Deep learning;Pathology;Adaptation models;Signal processing;Feature extraction;Acoustics;pathological image;attention pooling;end-to-end model;patch scoring;multi-instance learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"ICASSP 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10094946
An Application of Quantum Mechanics to Attention Methods in Computer Vision,"This work proposes the quantum-state-based mapping (QSM) for machine learning. QSM uses wave functions that describe microscopic particle systems as mappings. By QSM, original inputs or features extracted by neural networks are processed as quantum states to train wave function parameters. QSM has a low computational cost, almost no additional parameters, and is easy to integrate with other modules. We demonstrate the simplest form of the wave function as a mapping, that is, when a one-dimensional particle is in an infinitely deep potential well, in combination with advanced attention modules. Experiments show that QSM significantly improves the feature recalibration ability of attention module in transfer learning tasks. Then, we tried to analyze the effectiveness of QSM.

Multi-Object Localization and Irrelevant-Semantic Separation for Nuclei Segmentation in Histopathology Images,"Automated segmentation of nuclei in histopathology images is critical for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Due to the high variability of nuclei morphology, numerous nuclei overlapping, and the wide existence of nuclei clusters, this task still remains challenging. In this paper, we propose an effective nuclei segmentation method for histopathology images based on a novel neural network for multi-object localization and irrelevant-semantic separation (MI-Net), which includes a multi-object localization module (MOLM), a deep boundary awareness module (DBAM), and an irrelevant semantic separation module (ISSM). Specifically, the MOLM is used to calibrate features to capture more comprehensive information about the location of nuclei. It alleviates the problem of cell adhesion in histopathology images. The DBAM is intended to extract boundary information and solve the blurred boundary problem effectively. The ISSM is used to separate foreground features from background features and effectively address the problem of complex backgrounds in histopathology images. It also solves the low contrast problem between the target objects and the background. We evaluate MI-Net on the famous MoNuSeg dataset and compare it with ten state-of-the-art methods. MI-Net surpasses the best-performed method by margins from 1.12% to 2.29% over standard evaluation metrics, showing its effectiveness on nuclei segmentation.",Location awareness;Image segmentation;Histopathology;Semantics;Neural networks;Signal processing;Task analysis;Nuclei segmentation;Multi-object localization;Boundary-aware;Convolutional neural network,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"ICASSP 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10096902

Automatic Defect Classification Using Semi-Supervised Learning With Defect Localization,"Automatic defect classification (ADC) systems automatically classify defects that inevitably occur during semiconductor manufacturing processes. ADC is the beginning of defect management that increases the yield of semiconductor chip production, and prevents accidents in the process. It takes a lot of engineer’s labor to classify defects, but ADC can be the answer to classify all defects at low cost. ADC employs the defect image of a wafer surface, captured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images can feature a variety of backgrounds based on the defect position on the wafer and the process steps. The manual classification of SEM images involves significant labor costs related to hiring experienced engineers. Despite recent ADC studies reporting good performance, the lack of labeled images and various backgrounds make it difficult to apply ADC in actual manufacturing processes. To address this issue, automated defect classification with defect localization is proposed herein. To this end, a classification model is specifically designed for reducing the effect of varying backgrounds using defect localization. Defect localization uses an object detection model to provide the region information of defects in SEM images. We aimed to design a classification model and defect detection model using semi-supervised learning to reduce labeling costs. Experimental results indicate that the classification performance, over 15 classes, is improved by 12.56% (9.82%p), as compared with that of supervised models.",Location awareness;Object detection;Data models;Scanning electron microscopy;Predictive models;Costs;Labeling;Auto defect classificati;semi-supervised learning;object detection;image classification;deep learning,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing,10.1109/TSM.2023.3278036

An Efficient And Clever Computer-Aided Diagnosis System Design Explicitly For Mammography Examination,"For women, breast cancer ranks among the most fatal diseases. Mammography is the most widely used and effective imaging technique for the initial detection of breast cancer. On a mammography, the most significant indicators of breast cancer are asymmetry, microcalcification, lumps, and distortion of the breast's architecture. What we call “microcalcification” (MC) refers to extremely minute deposits of calcium. It is common knowledge that the presence of clusters of microscopic calcification raises the cancer risk significantly. These microcalcification clusters are now being taken seriously as a reliable first signal in regular mammography screening. Microcalcifications occur in 61%-82% of malignant tumors, and in roughly 21% of these cases, they are the only indication of cancer. Microcalcifications on mammography film can be anywhere from 0.01mm2 to 1mm2. Considering how a radiologist's attention may be diverted from such minute calcium deposits. The diagnostic errors itself are the foundation of CAD in digital mammography. There are a plethora of computerized automated instruments for distinguishing and interpreting microcalcification's earliest stages. Diagnostic imaging, computer science, image processing, pattern recognition, and AI are all brought together in computer assisted diagnosis. The detection performance and screening efficacy of mammography can be improved with the help of digital image processing techniques, which CAD systems employ. CAD examines the digital mammography for suspicious regions and highlights them for the radiologist to further investigate. Once the suspicious area has been located, CAD separates it into sections, calculates many characteristics for each region, and uses the appropriate features to classify a lesion as benign or malignant.",Image segmentation;Technological innovation;Calcium;Microscopy;Malignant tumors;Reliability engineering;Breast cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 1st International Conference on Innovations in High Speed Communication and Signal Processing (IHCSP),10.1109/IHCSP56702.2023.10127214

Single-Shot Focus Estimation for Microscopy Imaging With Kernel Distillation,"Optical microscopy imaging provides cellular-level visualization of tissues, which has therefore become the gold standard for the diagnosis of cancers. Despite the significant contributions of optical microscopy to pathology, a fundamental pre-requist is to capture high-quality and all-in-focus images at high speed. In this work, we propose a Kernel Distillation AutoFocus (KDAF) method to predict the defocus distance based on a single-frame image. This work takes the advantages from both previous virtual-refocusing and single-shot focus estimation methods. During the training phase, the focus distance is formulated as a latent variable to determine the kernel of defocus blurring. The in-focus samples are processed via the kernel to generate the defocused images via the conditional convolutional neural networks. During the testing phase, we directly predict the focus distance via the latent features. Compared with previous works, the proposed method introduces the paired focused/defocused samples as strong supervision to learn the representative features for focus estimation. Experiments on BBBC and Incoherent datasets demonstrate that the proposed can effectively estimate the optimal focus distance. This method can accurately estimate the focus distance based on single-shot imaging. Accurate and automated focus estimation may potentially improve the imaging quality of microscopes, which can benefit the robust diagnosis.",Kernel;Estimation;Microscopy;Imaging;Training;Robot sensing systems;Cancer;Blur kernel;deep learning;focus estimation,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging,10.1109/TCI.2023.3281189

Colorectal Tissue Image Classification Across Datasets,"This work studies the performance of the pretrained models to classify colorectal tissues and the effectiveness of tissue image classification models when it is applied across different datasets that may exhibit different color characteristics. In particular, the study is conducted on three pre-trained CNN models, ResNet50, VGG19, and EfficientNetB3, where they are used as to extract a feature vector of the image patch. Then the multi-layer perceptron-based neural network is used to perform the task of multiclass classification. The result shows that the best accuracy to classify the colorectal histopathological images was achieved by the ResNet model with 93.87% test accuracy on the Kather-texture2016 image dataset. And for the accuracy of the classification model when it is trained in the public dataset and applied to the local datasets, the normalized color image test dataset showed the best accuracy rate at 80.69% when compared to raw images and grayscale images among the local datasets. This result suggests that the pre-trained classification models could be useful for tissue image classification tasks across various laboratory sources and image color adjustment could help enhance the recognition performance even further of the image classification model. Therefore, consideration for image color correction would be needed to preserve the recognition performance of the model if the pre-trained tissue image classification model is to be used off-the-shelf across laboratories.",Training;Visualization;Image recognition;Image color analysis;Color;Gray-scale;Feature extraction;colorectal cancer;histopathology;convolutional neural network;image classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"2023 20th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)",10.1109/ECTI-CON58255.2023.10153365
Optimization of Phase Transfer Methods of Gold Nanoprisms,"Gold nanomaterials are used in several application areas, such as biosensing, nanomedicine and catalysis. Triangular nanoprisms (flat nanoobjects with a triangular base) gained much attention in the past few years due to their unique anisotropic shape, optical and plasmonic properties. In this work nanoprisms were prepared using a seed-mediated growth method in a polar solvent. The synthetized particles were examined with SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and their absorption spectra were also measured by spectrophotometry. The aim of the work is the investigation and optimization of phase transfer methods, namely, to transfer the nanoprisms from the polar environment of their synthesis to nonpolar, organic solvents, without nanoparticle aggregation or segregation.

An improved algorithm for interactive medical image segmentation based on Intelligent scissors,"Image segmentation is an important part of computer vision technology, which aims to extract areas of interest for feature acquisition and analysis. The accuracy of medical image segmentation has a direct impact on the decision-making capacity of doctors to diagnose patients' condition. In this paper, the interactive medical image segmentation algorithm based on the intelligent scissors is selected to process the medical image. It can not only combine the subjective experience but also reduce the operation obstacles and speed up the segmentation. The main work of this paper is as follows: 1. Based on the full study of the intelligent scissors algorithm, the principles and methods for the digraph's weight selection in the algorithm construction are clarified, which can improve the accuracy of the algorithm effectively. 2. The IOU factor was introduced to evaluate the image segmentation effect, which can analyze the existing defects from a quantitative perspective. By calculating the similarity between pathological images and normal images, the rationality of image segmentation result analysis is improved. 3. The intelligent scissors algorithm is improved by the modified Canny operator to reduce the generation of pseudo-edges and protect the weaker edges from rejection, which largely improves the accuracy of the segmentation. 4.

Machine Learning Models for Histopathological Breast Cancer Image Classification,"Breast cancer is among the most common forms of cancer, representing 30% of cancer cases in the United States per year and is the leading cause of cancer-induced mortality. Diagnosis is determined through biopsies followed by analysis of histopathological images. Machine Learning (ML) proves to be an essential image classification tool, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) providing high accuracy, but long training time. To provide optimal ML models for medical use and evaluate model performance, unstructured images are converted to structured data. Singular Value Decomposition extracted features from 277,524 histopathological images and Recursive Feature Selection reduced the dimensionality of the resultant dataset.

An Optimized Multi-Organ Cancer Cells Segmentation for Histopathological Images Based on CBAM-Residual U-Net,"In digital pathology, the accurate segmentation of cell nuclei in histopathology images is essential for medical image analysis. Histopathologists visually evaluate the patterns of cellular architecture and tissue patterns in histopathology image analysis for cancer detection to determine the malignant tissue portions and assess the severity of malignancy. However, manually analyzing scans using a high-resolution microscope requires significant effort and time. A computer-assisted diagnosis system utilizing deep learning (DL) algorithms rapidly, reliably, and automatically segments cell nuclei. However, the existing research studies have limited accuracy, high computational costs, and a lack of robustness and generalizability on diverse datasets. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel and improved DL architecture based on the U-Net, namely, the CBAM-Residual U-Net for improving accuracy, robustness, and generalized segmentation algorithm that can be applied to various staining techniques and tissue structures. The proposed architecture utilizes a ResConv and convolution block attention modules (CBAM). These modules help the proposed architecture learn the image’s shallow and deep features. The CBAM module uses an attention mechanism concentrating on essential features such as cell nuclei’s shape, texture, and intensity to accurately segment the raw input patterns. The proposed CBAM-Residual U-Net involves fewer trainable parameters, reducing the computational and time cost s compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme on publicly available datasets: i) Data Science Bowl (DSB) 2018, ii) The GlaS, iii) Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).

Perspectives of machine learning on protein structure prediction and function,"The experimental techniques for determining protein structure using electron microscopy and other various methods. These are all laborious, time-consuming processes that call for knowledge. Using data gathered in the protein libraries and computational approaches, scientists employ prediction tools to make the process less time-consuming. Machine learning techniques have piqued the community's interest in structure prediction in recent years. The majority strategies off machine learning helps in protein structure prediction and function focus on co-evolutionary techniques. The quantity of homologous protein sequences present in the databases affects how accurate these methods are. Many proteins experience difficulty with the prediction challenge, particularly those with a dearth of sequence homologs. Without using any assumptions, deep learning techniques enable the extraction of complex features from protein sequence data. Protein structures that are accurately predicted are used to create antibodies, study protein-protein interactions, and develop new drugs.

Self-Supervised Digital Histopathology Image Disentanglement for Arbitrary Domain Stain Transfer,"Diagnosis of cancerous diseases relies on digital histopathology images from stained slides. However, the staining varies among medical centers, which leads to a domain gap of staining. Existing generative adversarial network (GAN) based stain transfer methods highly rely on distinct domains of source and target, and cannot handle unseen domains. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a self-supervised disentanglement network (SDN) for domain-independent optimization and arbitrary domain stain transfer. SDN decomposes an image into features of content and stain. By exchanging the stain features, the staining style of an image is transferred to the target domain. For optimization, we propose a novel self-supervised learning policy based on the consistency of stain and content among augmentations from one instance. Therefore, the process of training SDN is independent on the domain of training data, and thus SDN is able to tackle unseen domains. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that SDN achieves the top performance in intra-dataset and cross-dataset stain transfer compared with the state-of-the-art stain transfer models, while the number of parameters in SDN is three orders of magnitude smaller parameters than that of compared models. Through stain transfer, SDN improves AUC of downstream classification model on unseen data without fine-tuning. Therefore, the proposed disentanglement framework and self-supervised learning policy have significant advantages in eliminating the stain gap among multi-center histopathology images.",Image color analysis;Histopathology;Feature extraction;Training;Self-supervised learning;Optimization;Image reconstruction;Stain normalization;stain transfer;histopathological image analysis;digital pathology;computational pathology;self-supervised learning,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,10.1109/TMI.2023.3298361
Image Synthesis and Modified BlendMask Instance Segmentation for Automated Nanoparticle Phenotyping,"Automated nanoparticle phenotyping is a critical aspect of high-throughput drug research, which requires analyzing nanoparticle size, shape, and surface topography from microscopy images. To automate this process, we present an instance segmentation pipeline that partitions individual nanoparticles on microscopy images. Our pipeline makes two key contributions. Firstly, we synthesize diverse and approximately realistic nanoparticle images to improve robust learning. Secondly, we improve the BlendMask model to segment tiny, overlapping, or sparse particle images. Specifically, we propose a parameterized approach for generating novel pairs of single particles and their masks, encouraging greater diversity in the training data. To synthesize more realistic particle images, we explore three particle placement rules and an image selection criterion. The improved one-stage instance segmentation network extracts distinctive features of nanoparticles and their context at both local and global levels, which addresses the data challenges associated with tiny, overlapping, or sparse nanoparticles.

These blocks can be identified from the spatial and time-depth variable Two-Photon Excitation Microscopy (TPEF) images of the brain blood vessels using machine learning methods. In this study, we propose several pre-processing schemes to improve the performance of these methods. Our method includes 3D-point cloud data extraction from image modality and their feature-space fusion to leverage complementary information inherent in different modalities. We also enforce the learned representation to be sequence-order invariant by utilizing bidirection dataflow. Experimental results on The Clog Loss dataset1 show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art pre-processing methods in stalled and non-stalled vessel classification.1https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/65/clog-loss-alzheimersresearch/data/",Microscopy;Machine learning;Blood vessels;Signal processing;Feature extraction;Medical diagnosis;Data mining;Bi-directional dataflow;Pre-processing;Deep neural networks;Multimodal fusion;Point cloud,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Workshops (ICASSPW)",10.1109/ICASSPW59220.2023.10193405
A feature engineering method for machine learning inspired by quantum mechanics,"This work proposes a quantum-state-based feature engineering (QSFE) method for machine learning. QSFE uses wave functions that describe microscopic particle systems as mappings. By QSFE, original inputs or features extracted by neural networks are processed as quantum states to train wave function parameters. The experiments demonstrate that QSFE can improve the feature recalibration ability in deep neural networks. QSFE has a low computational cost, almost no additional parameters, and is easy to integrate with other modules. This work unfolds two effectiveness of QSFE: firstly, QSFE can enhance the expression ability of the model and make full use of the features extracted from the previous network; secondly, QSFE can extract complex spatial and temporal interactions, following the self-organization theory. The validations on various machine learning tasks, including a classical self-organization model, indicate that QSFE is valuable in interdisciplinary machine learning applications.",Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Microscopy;Computational modeling;Potential well;Computer architecture;Quantum state;Attention method;Quantum mechanics;Image classification;Self-organization,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10192017
An Oriented Object Detector towards Diatoms,"Automatic diatom detection refers to the task of identifying and characterizing diatoms based on artificial intelligence. It will replace traditional time-consuming and laborious manual microscopy method of diatom observation to greatly accelerate the process of diatom research and some diatomrelated studies, such as diatom abundance statistics, using diatom properties for environmental monitoring and paleoenvironmental reconstruction. However, complex background interference and the detection of slender diatoms with different integrity are two major challenges for automatic diatom detection. To solve the mentioned-above issues, we propose an oriented object detector for automatic diatom detection based on RepPoints, called OOD-RepPoints. Specifically, for encouraging the network to adaptively capture the feature of slender diatoms, we design a cascaded feature refinement head (CFRH) which consists of points generation stage and points refinement stage, to progressively optimize the extraction of slender diatom features. Furthermore, to fit the shape of diatoms well, especially for slender diatoms, we propose a tailored label assignment strategy for our CFRH, which contains a short side assigner (SSA) for points generation stage and an adaptive IoU thresholds assigner (AITA) for points refinement stage. Besides, we contribute a so called O-Diatom dataset for automatic diatom detection. The dataset has 1711 images which contains 3949 diatoms and provides finely manual oriented bounding box annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrated our method achieve state of the art performance and can reach mAP 89.9% which is highest on O-Diatom, and shows competitive results on slender categories of publicly available datasets (i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016).",Head;Optical microscopy;Shape;Annotations;Microscopy;Manuals;Detectors;Diatom Detection;Oriented Object Detection;Deformable Convolution;Label Assignment,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191878
Extremely Large Area Integrated Circuit (ELAIC): An Advanced Packaging Solution for Chiplets,"The slow-down of Moore's-Law-related lithographic scaling in high-density semiconductor integrated circuits has created a major impact on the design of computing hardware architecture. Computer architects are exploring heterogeneous assemblies of specialized chips (called “chiplets”) as an alternative way (i.e., “More-Than-Moore”) to provide the increasing computing capability needed to satisfy our data intensive future. Microelectronics packaging is evolving to meet the computing demands of increasing power and performance in ever smaller packages. To accomplish this, new packaging structures need to be able to integrate more chiplets with smaller technology nodes (5-, 7-, or 10-nanometer), higher I/O counts, and smaller interconnect pitches, while reducing the overall assembly footprint. This paper describes a new extremely large area integrated circuit (ELAIC) solution suitable for combining multiple chiplets of varying type (e.g., memory, ASICs, CPU, GPU, power conditioning) into a single package on a common interconnect platform. The ELAIC approach helps to rearchitect heterogeneous chip tiling for developing highly complex systems having desired circuit density and performance. Recent work on large-area superconducting integrated circuits to join multiple individual die is highlighted, with particular attention paid to the processing of the high-density electrical interconnects formed between the individual die. A variety of ELAIC assemblies were fabricated and characterized using several techniques (i.e., scanning-electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy, confocal microscopy, X-ray) to investigate the integration quality, minimum feature size, silicon content, die-to-die spacing, and gap filling. Silicon dioxide, benzocyclobutene (BCB), epoxy, polyimide, and silicone-based dielectrics were used for gap fill, via formation and redistribution layers (RDLs). For the ELAIC approach, the thermal stability is improved by reducing the die-to-die (D2D) gap and increasing the silicon content, allowing assemblers to mitigate the problem of mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for different substrates/modules integration schemes, which is important for allowing the broad temperature range stability from reflow to operation at room or even cryogenic temperatures. ELAIC technology facilitates more space-efficient designs and can accommodate most heterogeneous die without compromising stability or introducing CTE mismatch or warpage. A variety of heterogeneous chips were used to fabricate ELAIC modules. The present process allows fabrication of ELAIC buildup layers having thickness in the range of 1–10 microns, which allows packaging structures having both finer pitch and higher density. The processes and materials used to achieve smaller feature dimensions, satisfy stringent registration requirements, and achieve robust electrical interconnections are discussed.",Wiring;Thermal expansion;Temperature distribution;Optical microscopy;Microscopy;Integrated circuit interconnections;Packaging;chiplets;heterogeneous integration;multi-die system-on-chip;RDLs;chip tiling,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 73rd Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC),10.1109/ECTC51909.2023.00051
Assessing the Effect of Pre-processing Techniques on Classification of Breast Cancer using Histopathological Images,"Over past few decades Breast cancer (BC) has become more common and affecting females in early age, which is an alarming and challenging situation for researchers to provide methods to identify the disease in their early stage. This is the deadliest cancer among women and is alarming female fraternity becoming second leading cause of deaths. If the disease gets identified in their early stage it may leads to reduction in mortality rate. It may occur in cells that produce milk (lobules) or in the passages responsible for carrying milk (milk ducts). This paper presents the performance comparison of various pre-processing techniques based on the BreakHis dataset. The dataset used contains 1980 breast histopathological images including 625 benign and 1355 malignant cases. Initially the histopathological images have been pre-processed using techniques including contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), contrast stretching (CS), histogram equalization (HE), and unsharp masking (UM) followed by feature extraction using 2D Gabor Wavelet Transform to obtain texture feature from both the categories like original and preprocessed images. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) classifies the images in two categories namely benign and malignant. The experiments results show that texture features computed using UM as pre-processing tool outperformed for making difference between benign and malignant images using breast histopathological images with a classification accuracy of 84.1 %.",Support vector machines;Wavelet transforms;Histograms;Dairy products;Image analysis;Ducts;Adaptive equalizers;Histopathological images;Breast cancer;Pre-processing;Feature extraction;Classification,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"2023 3rd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Embedded and Secure Systems (ACCESS)",10.1109/ACCESS57397.2023.10201037
Development of Drop-On-Demand Inkjet Process for the Fabrication of Thin-Film Printed Devices,"The main benefit of inkjet printing (IJP) lies in its ability to eliminate the photolithography and etching processes that are fundamental to silicon manufacturing technology. This is due to the direct deposition of solution-processed materials in predefined patterns. Although IJP has been employed in the production of various thin-film devices (TFD), there are still significant challenges in achieving fully printed TFDs. These include adjusting the rheological properties of formulated inks with drop-on-demand (DoD) printers and developing a comprehensive understanding of the parameters and conditions required for the IJP process to yield a desired morphology, film thickness, and pattern area uniformity. This investigation proposes to develop a process for the IJP of solution-processed materials, considering not only the ink rheological properties but also the parameters and setup conditions of the DoD printer employed. Commercial inks with specific rheological properties for IJP are used to print materials patterns with different resolutions, under continuous ejection conditions. The morphology and film thickness variations of the printed material are characterized by employing atomic force microscopy, ellipsometry, and optical microscopy. The obtained results depend on the rheological properties and solid content in the ink, as well as the configured parameters of the DoD printer. These findings can provide valuable evidence for attaining optimal conditions to enhance the surface wettability and develop the stacking of printed patterns of different materials. The focus of this work is on the fabrication of TFDs through a complete IJP process and improving their performance.",Atomic force microscopy;Optical microscopy;Surface morphology;Morphology;Surface roughness;US Department of Defense;Rough surfaces;Inkjet printing;Drop-On-Demand;Printability;Morphology;Film thickness;Thin-film electronic devices,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE Latin American Electron Devices Conference (LAEDC),10.1109/LAEDC58183.2023.10208285
A Heterogeneous Ensemble Learning Approach for Leather Species Prediction,"This paper proposes heterogeneous ensemble learning for automatic leather species identification. I t combines the advantage of four learning algorithms for reliable and robust results. The objective is to predict the leather species from novel digital microscopic leather images. Hence, firstly, it extracts seventeen derived and 512 deep features to describe the species-definite leather image behavior. Secondly, these features are used to train the four base learners: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Thirdly, an ensemble model is built by fusing the prediction accuracies of four models in a voting scheme. Lastly, it utilizes data partitioning to achieve better generalization. The experimental analysis affirms that the proposed ensemble model outperforms the base learners with 98.75% accuracy and 98.77% precision. It resulted in robust results with negligible misclassification (1.25 %). Thus, the present work sufficiently l earns divergence from images, features, and models.

MSCA-UNet: Multi-Scale Convolutional Attention UNet for Automatic Cell Counting Using Density Regression,"The quantification of cell numbers in microscopy images plays a vital role in biomedical research and medical diagnosis. Presently, deep regression networks are widely employed to generate cell density maps, and the number of cells is obtained by integrating the density maps. However, automating cell counting remains challenging due to the variability in cell morphology, the diversity of cell types, and the interference of image backgrounds. This paper aims to address the central question: ‘Can we design a robust and efficient deep learning model that can effectively count cells in microscopy images, regardless of these challenges?’ To tackle this issue, we propose a novel multi-scale convolutional attention UNet (MSCA-UNet) based on density regression. Compared with other advanced density regression methods, our method introduces two key innovations. Firstly, we employ an MSCA block with multi-scale interaction ability as an encoder component, which, when combined with spatial attention, enhances the extraction of cell details and spatial information. Secondly, the design of the asymmetric UNet allows the encoder to extract more global information and better understand the image. In the meantime, using smaller convolutional kernels and strides in the decoder helps to restore image details and edge information, resulting in improved network performance. Our method outperformed other advanced methods on three publicly available benchmark cell datasets, including the synthetic bacterial (VGG) dataset, the modified bone marrow (MBM) dataset, and the human subcutaneous adipose tissue (ADI) dataset.",Feature extraction;Microscopy;Estimation;Decoding;Diseases;Task analysis;Cells (biology);Automatic cell counting;microscopy images;density map;multi-scale convolutional attention,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3304993
Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning On Whole-Slide Pathological Images,"Multi-instance learning (MIL) is an effective paradigm for whole-slide pathological images (WSIs) classification to handle the gigapixel resolution and slide-level label. Prevailing MIL methods primarily focus on improving the feature extractor and aggregator. However, one deficiency of these methods is that the bag contextual prior may trick the model into capturing spurious correlations between bags and labels. This deficiency is a confounder that limits the performance of existing MIL methods. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning (IBMIL), to achieve deconfounded bag-level prediction. Unlike traditional likelihood-based strategies, the proposed scheme is based on the backdoor adjustment to achieve the interventional training, thus is capable of suppressing the bias caused by the bag contextual prior. Note that the principle of IBMIL is orthogonal to existing bag MIL methods. Therefore, IBMIL is able to bring consistent performance boosting to existing schemes, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

This can be regarded as a special case of the instance segmentation task with several unique challenges such as the concentric circular ring shape of the objects and high precision requirements that result in inadequate performance of existing methods. We propose a new iterative method which we term Iterative Next Boundary Detection (INBD). It intuitively models the natural growth direction, starting from the center of the shrub cross section and detecting the next ring boundary in each iteration step.

"MAESTER: Masked Autoencoder Guided Segmentation at Pixel Resolution for Accurate, Self-Supervised Subcellular Structure Recognition","Accurate segmentation of cellular images remains an elusive task due to the intrinsic variability in morphology of biological structures. Complete manual segmentation is unfeasible for large datasets, and while supervised methods have been proposed to automate segmentation, they often rely on manually generated ground truths which are especially challenging and time consuming to generate in biology due to the requirement of domain expertise. Furthermore, these methods have limited generalization capacity, requiring additional manual labels to be generated for each dataset and use case. We introduce MAESTER (Masked AutoEncoder guided Segmen'Iation at pixEl Resolution), a self-supervised method for accurate, subcellular structure segmentation at pixel resolution. MAESTER treats segmentation as a representation learning and clustering problem. Specifically, MAESTER learns semantically meaningful token representations of multi-pixel image patches while simultaneously maintaining a sufficiently large field of view for contextual learning. We also develop a cover-and-stride inference strategy to achieve pixel-level subcellular structure segmentation. We evaluated MAESTER on a publicly available volumetric electron microscopy (VEM) dataset of primary mouse pancreatic islets ß cells and achieved up-wards of 29.1 % improvement over state-of-the-art under the same evaluation criteria. Furthermore, our results are competitive against supervised methods trained on the same tasks, closing the gap between self-supervised and supervised approaches. MAESTER shows promise for alleviating the critical bottleneck of ground truth generation for imaging related data analysis and thereby greatly increasing the rate of biological discovery.

FFF: Fragment-Guided Flexible Fitting for Building Complete Protein Structures,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a technique for reconstructing the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of biomolecules (especially large protein complexes and molecular assemblies). As the resolution increases to the near-atomic scale, building protein structures de novo from cryo-EM maps becomes possible. Recently, recognition based de novo building methods have shown the potential to streamline this process. However, it cannot build a complete structure due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) problem. At the same time, AlphaFold has led to a great break through in predicting protein structures. This has inspired us to combine fragment recognition and structure prediction methods to build a complete structure. In this paper, we propose a new method named FFF that bridges protein structure prediction and protein structure recognition with flexible fitting. First, a multi-level recognition network is used to capture various structural features from the input 3D cryo-EM map. Next, protein structural fragments are generated using pseudo peptide vectors and a protein sequence alignment method based on these extracted features. Finally, a complete structural model is constructed using the predicted protein fragments via flexible fitting.

Supervised deep learning for segmentation has achieved unparalleled success when sufficient training data with annotated labels are available. However, annotation is known to be expensive to obtain, especially for histopathology images where the target regions are usually with high morphology variations and irregular shapes. Thus, weakly supervised learning with sparse annotations of points is promising to reduce the annotation workload. In this work, we propose a contrast-based variational model to generate segmentation results, which serve as reliable complementary supervision to train a deep segmentation model for histopathology images. The proposed method considers the common characteristics of target regions in histopathology images and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. It can generate more regionally consistent and smoother boundary segmentation, and is more robust to unlabeled ‘novel’ regions. Experiments on two different histology datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to previous models.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Neuron Membrane Segmentation based on Structural Features,"AI-enhanced segmentation of neuronal boundaries in electron microscopy (EM) images is crucial for automatic and accurate neuroinformatics studies. To enhance the limited generalization ability of typical deep learning frameworks for medical image analysis, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been applied. In this work, we propose to improve the performance of UDA methods on cross-domain neuron membrane segmentation in EM images. First, we designed a feature weight module considering the structural features during adaptation. Second, we introduced a structural feature-based super-resolution approach to alleviating the domain gap by adjusting the cross-domain image resolutions. Third, we proposed an orthogonal decomposition module to facilitate the extraction of domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on two domain adaptive membrane segmentation applications have indicated the effectiveness of our method.",Knowledge engineering;Image segmentation;Image analysis;Image edge detection;Superresolution;Neurons;Neuroinformatics;Neuron membrane segmentation;unsupervised domain adaptation;electron microscopy images,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME),10.1109/ICME55011.2023.00167
AutoKary2022: A Large-Scale Densely Annotated Dataset for Chromosome Instance Segmentation,"Automated chromosome instance segmentation from metaphase cell microscopic images is critical for the diagnosis of chromosomal disorders (i.e., karyotype analysis). However, it is still a challenging task due to lacking of densely annotated datasets and the complicated morphologies of chromosomes, e.g., dense distribution, arbitrary orientations, and wide range of lengths. To facilitate the development of this area, we take a big step forward and manually construct a large-scale densely annotated dataset named AutoKary2022, which contains over 27,000 chromosome instances in 612 microscopic images from 50 patients. Specifically, each instance is annotated with a polygonal mask and a class label to assist in precise chromosome detection and segmentation. On top of it, we systematically investigate representative methods on this dataset and obtain a number of interesting findings, which helps us have a deeper understanding of the fundamental problems in chromosome instance segmentation. We hope this dataset could advance research towards medical understanding.

Optical Properties of Two-Dimensional Islands of Tungsten Disulfide (WS2),"The paper presents the results of investigation of the optical and structural properties for tungsten disulfide (WS2) islands using atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman scattering, and photoluminescence (PL). The morphology and local composition as well as oxidation induced changes in the WS2 islands were investigated. Micro- Raman and micro-PL spectra reveal the fundamental vibrational end exciton modes in WS2 islands, respectively. The intensity distribution maps of the phonon and exciton modes are discussed. The frequency dependences for the fundamental vibrational modes (A1gand E2g) in WS2 islands on their thickness is obtained. A low-frequency shift of the E2g mode and a high-frequency shift of the A1gmode with increasing the number of layers are reported. A shift in the PL peak energy position and changes in intensity induced by defects in the WS2 islands are observed. It is suggested that the shift of the PL energy, apparently, can be associated with the sample oxidation.",Optical microscopy;Atom optics;Force;Raman scattering;Tungsten;Photoluminescence;Phonons;Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD);tungsten disulfide (WS2);Raman scattering;photoluminescence (PL);atomic force microscopy (AFM),INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 24th International Conference of Young Professionals in Electron Devices and Materials (EDM),10.1109/EDM58354.2023.10225062
Multiple Instance Learning with Critical Instance for Whole Slide Image Classification,"Histopathological whole slide image (WSI) classification is a fundamental task in clinical diagnosis. The extremely high resolution of WSIs makes it laborious to obtain localized annotations. Hence, WSI classification is often cast as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem when only slide-level labels are available. A major challenge for MIL approaches is that the proportion of malignant regions in a malignant WSI could be very small, resulting in the misclassification of these slides. In this work, we propose to find the critical instance in the projection space of instance representations. A novel critical instance pooling is proposed to aggregate instance representations with normalized distances between instances and the critical instance. Additionally, a feature magnitude loss is utilized to enforce the discrepancy between positive and negative instances in the projection space. Experimental results on existing benchmark datasets showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.",Image resolution;Annotations;Aggregates;Benchmark testing;Clinical diagnosis;Task analysis;Image classification;Multiple instance learning;whole slide image;computational pathology;classification;deep learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI53787.2023.10230595
Mind the Gap: Scanner-Induced Domain Shifts Pose Challenges for Representation Learning in Histopathology,"Computer-aided systems in histopathology are often challenged by various sources of domain shift that impact the performance of these algorithms considerably. We investigated the potential of using self-supervised pre-training to overcome scanner-induced domain shifts for the downstream task of tumor segmentation. For this, we present the Barlow Triplets to learn scanner-invariant representations from a multi-scanner dataset with local image correspondences. We show that self-supervised pre-training successfully aligned different scanner representations, which, interestingly only results in a limited benefit for our downstream task. We thereby provide insights into the influence of scanner characteristics for downstream applications and contribute to a better understanding of why established self-supervised methods have not yet shown the same success on histopathology data as they have for natural images.",Representation learning;Image segmentation;Histopathology;Task analysis;Tumors;Biomedical imaging;Histopathology;Domain Shift;Representation Learning;Barlow Twins,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI53787.2023.10230458
Cell Instance Segmentation VIA Multi-Scale Non-Local Correlation,"For cell instance segmentation on Electron Microscopy (EM) images, state-of-the-art methods either conduct pixel-wise classification or follow a detection and segmentation manner. However, both approaches suffer from the enormous cell instances of EM images where cells are tightly close to each other and show inconsistent morphological properties and/or homogeneous appearances. This fact can easily lead to over-segmentation and under-segmentation problems for model prediction, i.e., falsely splitting and merging adjacent instances. In this paper, we propose a novel approach incorporating non-local correlation in the embedding space to make pixel features distinct or similar to their neighbors and thus address the over- and under-segmentation problems. We perform experiments on five different EM datasets where our proposed method yields better results than several strong baselines. More importantly, by using non-local correlation, we observe fewer false separations within one cell and fewer false fusions between cells.",Image segmentation;Correlation;Shape;Merging;Predictive models;Electron microscopy;Proposals,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI53787.2023.10230512
Fast and Interpretable Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for FIB-SEM Cell Segmentation,"Electron microscopy imaging techniques allow biologists to obtain nanoscale slice volumes of cells in which biological structures can be statistically analyzed under the condition that the tedious task of segmentation can be automated. If a learned segmentation has good results on images obtained under the same acquisition process, variations in this acquisition can drastically affect the final image’s features and can lead to a drop of segmentation performances. To tackle this problem, we propose an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) framework based on Batch Normalization. Our method tested on mitochondria segmentation shows better results than state-of-the art methods and uses few computation resources, allowing a near real-time use. Furthermore, we propose a metric based on the Wasserstein distance to evaluate the effect of this normalization. We empirically show that this measure is log-linearly correlated with the drop of performances of the adapted segmentation and sheds light on the gain obtained by our UDA framework.",Image segmentation;Toy manufacturing industry;Graphics processing units;Biomedical measurement;Gain measurement;Real-time systems;Nanoscale devices;Unsupervised domain adaptation;Cell mitochondria segmentation;FIB-SEM;quantifying domain shift,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI53787.2023.10230327
Planar to Spatial: a Synapse Reconstruction Method to Rebuild Voxel Connections for Anisotropic Serial EM Images,"Reconstructing synapses from anisotropic serial electron microscopy (EM) images remains challenging, especially in restoring neural circuits. Recently, hybrid 2D/3D convolution is proposed to tackle this anisotropy problem. However, Z-axis anisotropy results in distinct structural changes and voxel-level shifts. As a result, the vanilla convolution is ineffective for recovering the instance details end-to-end from anisotropic semantic information, resulting in split/merge or deviation errors. In this study, we propose a synapse reconstruction method to rebuild spatial connections of voxels from accurate planar semantics. First, we design a region-focused Mask R-CNN with a cross-patch fusion method. Anchors and losses are constrained by instance boxes to accommodate the narrow structure of synapses. Furthermore, instance confidences are used for multi-scenario duplicate detection fusion. Second, we present a novel synaptic similarity metric on the basis of synaptic shape and spatial information. A learnable hierarchical clustering strategy based on this metric is performed to obtain the voxel connections. Experiments on anisotropic EM data show the superior performance of our method, especially on the integrity of reconstructed structures.

SIAN: Style-Guided Instance-Adaptive Normalization for Multi-Organ Histopathology Image Synthesis,"Existing deep neural networks for histopathology image synthesis cannot generate image styles that align with different organs, and cannot produce accurate boundaries of clustered nuclei. To address these issues, we propose a style-guided instance-adaptive normalization (SIAN) approach to synthesize realistic color distributions and textures for histopathology images from different organs. SIAN contains four phases, semantization, stylization, instantiation, and modulation. The first two phases synthesize image semantics and styles by using semantic maps and learned image style vectors. The instantiation module integrates geometrical and topological information and generates accurate nuclei boundaries. We validate the proposed approach on a multiple-organ dataset, Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method generates more realistic histopathology images than four state-of-the-art approaches for five organs. By incorporating synthetic images from the proposed approach to model training, an instance segmentation network can achieve state-of-the-art performance.",Training;Deep learning;Image segmentation;Histopathology;Image synthesis;Phase modulation;Image color analysis;Histopathology image synthesis;style manipulation;nuclei annotation,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),10.1109/ISBI53787.2023.10230507
Instance Segmentation of Dislocations in TEM Images,"Quantitative Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during in-situ straining experiment is able to reveal the motion of dislocations - linear defects in the crystal lattice of metals. In the domain of materials science, the knowledge about the location and movement of dislocations is important for creating novel materials with superior properties. A longstanding problem, however, is to identify the position and extract the shape of dislocations, which would ultimately help to create a digital twin of such materials. In this work, we quantitatively compare state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, including Mask R-CNN and YOLOv8. The dislocation masks as the results of the instance segmentation are converted to mathematical lines, enabling quantitative analysis of dislocation length and geometry - important information for the domain scientist, which we then propose to include as a novel length-aware quality metric for estimating the network performance. Our segmentation pipeline shows a high accuracy suitable for all domain-specific, further post-processing. Additionally, our physics-based metric turns out to perform much more consistently than typically used pixel-wise metrics.",Measurement;Image segmentation;Materials science and technology;Transmission electron microscopy;Statistical analysis;Shape;Source coding,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Nanotechnology (NANO),10.1109/NANO58406.2023.10231169
A Counting Algorithm for Adhesion of Wheat Scab Spore Based on Contour Angle-to-distance Ratio,"Aiming at the problem of low efficiency of manual counting of wheat scab spore microscopic images, we propose a counting algorithm for adhesion of wheat scabs spore based on contour angle-to-distance ratio. Specifically, the algorithm first improves the microscopic image quality of wheat scab spores utilizing Mean Shift and eliminates the influence of impurities and noise. Then, the adhesion of spores were screened by the Sobel operator and shape feature factor, and all adhesion spores were segmented according to the angle-to-distance ratio of spore contour, and finally, he spore count was completed. The experimental results show that this algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 93.1% in 313 wheat scab spore microscopic images, which is 7.9% higher than the traditional machine learning clustering algorithm. This algorithm can quickly and accurately calculate the number of wheat scab spores and can provide technical support for disease prevention and food security.",Image quality;Image segmentation;Machine learning algorithms;Adhesives;Shape;Microscopy;Impurities;wheat scab;spores;adhesion target;angle-to-distance ratio;count,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 11th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics),10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics59224.2023.10233682
Topology-Dependent Brownian Gyromotion of a Single Skyrmion,"Non-interacting particles exhibiting Brownian motion have been observed in many occasions of sciences, such as molecules suspended in liquids, optically trapped microbeads, and spin textures in magnetic materials. In particular, a detailed examination of Brownian motion of spin textures is important for designing thermally stable spintronic devices, which motivates the present study. In our recent work, through using temporally and spatially resolved polar magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy, we have experimentally observed the thermal-fluctuation-induced random walk of a single isolated Néel-type magnetic skyrmion in an interfacially asymmetric Ta/CoFeB/TaOx multilayer. Interestingly, a nonlinear temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient and topology-dependent gyromotion are obtained and further formulated based on the stochastic Thiele equation. The experimental and numerical demonstration of topology-dependent Brownian gyromotion of skyrmions can be useful for understanding the nonequilibrium magnetization dynamics and implementing unconventional spintronic devices.",Magnetic multilayers;Optical microscopy;Microscopy;Nonhomogeneous media;Optical materials;Micromagnetics;Spatial resolution;Skyrmion;Brownian Motion;Topology;Spintronics;Micromagnetics,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE International Magnetic Conference - Short Papers (INTERMAG Short Papers),10.1109/INTERMAGShortPapers58606.2023.10228449
Birefringent Elements for Optical Microscopy by Ultrafast Laser Writing,"Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy is one of the most powerful label-free optical imaging techniques available for imaging biological and transparent media with high spatial resolution. Wollaston or Nomarsky prisms that shift the reference beam are key elements in this imaging technology [1]. These prisms are made from birefringent crystals (quartz) and are difficult to manufacture for the small shear angles required at high magnifications. Femtosecond laser writing has emerged as a technologically attractive method for birefringence patterning in silica glass by forming anisotropic nanopores with ultrahigh transmittance (>99%) [2] creating negative form birefringence (−0.0016), comparable to the positive birefringence of a quartz crystal (+0.009). Here we demonstrate that high performance birefringent elements for DIC microscopy, geometric phase prism (GP prism) and retardance gradient prism (X prism), can be fabricated by modulating slow axis or retardance of the birefringent modification with ultrafast laser writing.",Silicon compounds;Optical microscopy;Writing;Optical imaging;Ultrafast electronics;Quartz crystals;Ultrafast optics,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),10.1109/CLEO/Europe-EQEC57999.2023.10231634
Midinfrared Optical Force for Sorting Materials Depending on their Chemical Structures,"Mechanical control of micro- and nanometer-scale materials using lasers forms an indispensable class of techniques for advancing nanoscience and nanotechnology. Optical force (radiation pressure) is exerted on such materials when the momentum of a laser is transferred to them through light scattering and absorption. The magnitude and the sign of optical force depends on the light-matter interactions. For instance, fluorescent nano-diamonds can be sorted by exciting the electronic transition energies of their nitrogen-vacancy centers [1]; the optical force on a dye-doped polystyrene particle is resonantly enhanced by using a 1064 nm trapping laser and 488 nm wide-field excitation laser [2]. In addition, based on circular dichroism, liquid crystal chiral droplets can be sorted using counter-propagating laser beams which are right and left circularly polarized [3].

"Identification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Subtypes: M1, M2, M3 on White Blood Cells Using Microscopic Images","Leukemia is a form of blood cancer characterized by an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells that invade the body’s immune system. Leukemias are divided into four main groups based on cell type and growth rate. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is one of them, namely leukemia that occurs in the myeloid series. AML itself is divided into several subtypes, according to the French-American-British (FAB), namely M0-M7. AML subtypes M1, M2, and M3 are influenced by the same cell type, namely myeloblast cells, so a more detailed analysis is needed to classify them. Therefore we need a system that can identify the presence of AML in the blood, this identification is done by classifying white blood cells on microscopic images. To detect the presence of AML in microscopic images, multiple processes will be used, including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification stages by applying the K-NN method. This classification procedure will result in a diagnosis of M1, M2, or M3 blood cells. At the end of phase 1 of this final project, pre-processing and segmentation processes and graphical user interface (GUI) designs have been carried out. This final project resulted in an accuracy of 80% for the identification of subtype M1, 70% for the identification of subtype M2, and 80% for the identification of subtype M3.",White blood cells;Image segmentation;Nearest neighbor methods;Feature extraction;Electron microscopy;Graphical user interfaces;Immune system;Leukemia;Acute Myeloid Leukemia;Image Processing;AML Subtypes;Classification;K-NN Method,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 International Electronics Symposium (IES),10.1109/IES59143.2023.10242476
Self-Supervised Triplet Contrastive Learning for Classifying Endometrial Histopathological Images,"Early identification of endometrial cancer or precancerous lesions from histopathological images is crucial for precise endometrial medical care, which however is increasing hampered by the relative scarcity of pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) provides an automated alternative for confirming endometrial diseases with either feature-engineered machine learning or end-to-end deep learning (DL). In particular, advanced self-supervised learning alleviates the dependence of supervised learning on large-scale human-annotated data and can be used to pre-train DL models for specific classification tasks. Thereby, we develop a novel self-supervised triplet contrastive learning (SSTCL) model for classifying endometrial histopathological images. Specifically, this model consists of one online branch and two target branches. The second target branch includes a simple yet powerful augmentation module named random mosaic masking (RMM), which functions as an effective regularization by mapping the features of masked images close to those of intact ones. Moreover, we add a bottleneck Transformer (BoT) model into each branch as a self-attention module to learn the global information by considering both content information and relative distances between features at different locations. On public endometrial dataset, our model achieved four-class classification accuracies of 77.31 ± 0.84, 80.87 ± 0.48 and 83.22 ± 0.87% using 20, 50 and 100% labeled images, respectively. When transferred to the in-house dataset, our model obtained a three-class diagnostic accuracy of 96.81% with 95% confidence interval of 95.61–98.02%. On both datasets, our model outperformed state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised methods. Our model may help pathologists to automatically diagnose endometrial diseases with high accuracy and efficiency using limited human-annotated histopathological images.",Solid modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Cancer;Task analysis;Lesions;Support vector machines;Predictive models;Histopathology;Biomedical imaging;Computer aided diagnosis;Self-supervised learning;Histopathological image;endometrial medical care;computer-aided diagnosis;self-supervised learning;contrastive learning,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3314663
A Hierarchical Graph V-Net With Semi-Supervised Pre-Training for Histological Image Based Breast Cancer Classification,"Numerous patch-based methods have recently been proposed for histological image based breast cancer classification. However, their performance could be highly affected by ignoring spatial contextual information in the whole slide image (WSI). To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical Graph V-Net by integrating 1) patch-level pre-training and 2) context-based fine-tuning, with a hierarchical graph network. Specifically, a semi-supervised framework based on knowledge distillation is first developed to pre-train a patch encoder for extracting disease-relevant features. Then, a hierarchical Graph V-Net is designed to construct a hierarchical graph representation from neighboring/similar individual patches for coarse-to-fine classification, where each graph node (corresponding to one patch) is attached with extracted disease-relevant features and its target label during training is the average label of all pixels in the corresponding patch. To evaluate the performance of our proposed hierarchical Graph V-Net, we collect a large WSI dataset of 560 WSIs, with 30 labeled WSIs from the BACH dataset (through our further refinement), 30 labeled WSIs and 500 unlabeled WSIs from Yunnan Cancer Hospital. Those 500 unlabeled WSIs are employed for patch-level pre-training to improve feature representation, while 60 labeled WSIs are used to train and test our proposed hierarchical Graph V-Net. Both comparative assessment and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed hierarchical Graph V-Net over state-of-the-art methods in classifying breast cancer from WSIs.

Benchmarking Feature Extractors for Reinforcement Learning-Based Semiconductor Defect Localization,"As semiconductor patterning dimensions shrink, more advanced Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image-based defect inspection techniques are needed. Recently, many Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed for defect localization and have shown impressive results. These methods often rely on feature extraction from a full SEM image and possibly a number of regions of interest. In this study, we propose a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to defect localization which iteratively extracts features from increasingly smaller regions of the input image. We compare the results of 18 agents trained with different feature extractors. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different feature extractors as well as the RL-based framework in general for semiconductor defect localization.",Location awareness;Deep learning;Scanning electron microscopy;Reinforcement learning;Inspection;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Feature extraction;metrology;object detection;reinforcement learning;semiconductor device manufacture,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 International Symposium ELMAR,10.1109/ELMAR59410.2023.10253916
An Automated Approach for Identification of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma based on 2D-ICNN,"Oral cancer (OC) is a malignant neoplasm that poses a significant threat to human health, resulting in a considerable fatality rate. India accounts for almost one-third of the global population of OC patients. Among the various types of OC, OSCC is the most common and dominant. Histopathological images are widely considered as the benchmark for diagnosing OSCC. However, this method is known to be time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise due to the heterogeneity of the tumor. To aid accurate diagnosis, artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been employed. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, such as the Two-Dimensional Improved Convolutional Neural Network (2D-ICNN) using GLCM have shown promise in predicting different medical image-based cancers, including breast cancer, OC, and lung cancer. This research work proposes a new approach for classifying OC by utilizing the 2D-ICNN technique. Our method focuses on extracting the best features from biopsy images of OSCC to train the model. By employing GLCM, achieve efficient feature extraction. The findings of our simulations indicate that the suggested model attains an especially elevated level of classification accuracy, amounting to 98.29%. The timely identification of OC, particularly in its early stages, is of paramount importance in facilitating optimal treatment and suitable therapy.

Machine Learning Model to Detect Chronic Leukemia in Microscopic Blood Smear Images,"Chronic leukemia is a slow-progressing form of disease, If not diagnosed on time can progress and increase the risk of life-threatening complications. It is essential to develop a fully automated system to recognize and categorize type of leukemia for proper evaluation and treatment.

Digital microscopic blood smear images were automatically cropped into single nucleus and segmented using watershed algorithm.

Harnessing Digital Pathology And Causal Learning To Improve Eosinophilic Esophagitis Dietary Treatment Assignment,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, food antigen-driven, allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus associated with elevated esophageal eosinophils. Second only to gastroesophageal reflux disease, EoE is one of the leading causes of chronic refractory dysphagia in adults and children. Diagnosis of EoE heavily relies on counting eosinophils in histological slides, a manual, laborious, time-consuming task that limits the ability to extract complex patient-dependent features. The treatment for EoE typically involves a combination of medication and dietary changes, particularly food elimination. A personalized, tailor-made food elimination plan is crucial for the patient’s engagement and treatment efficiency. Previous attempts to predict the best food-elimination strategy did not yield significant results. In this work, on the one hand, we utilize AI for inferring many histological features from the entire biopsy slide, features that cannot be extracted manually. On the other hand, we develop causal learning models that can process this wealth of data. We applied our approach to the “Six-Food vs. One-Food Eosinophilic Esophagitis Diet Study” (SOFEED), where 112 symptomatic adults aged 18-60 years with active EoE were assigned to either a six-food elimination diet (6FED) or a one-food elimination diet (IFED) for six weeks. Our results show that the average treatment effect (ATE) of the 6FED treatment compared with the IFED treatment is not significant, that is, neither diet was superior to the other. We examined several causal models and show that the best treatment strategy was obtained using T-learner with two XGBoost modules. While IFED only and 6FED only provide improvement for 35%-38% of the patients, which is not significantly different from a random treatment assignment, our causal model yields a significantly better improvement rate of 58.4%. This work demonstrates the importance of AI in examining the distribution of molecular features within histological slides and integrating them with causal learning to provide better treatment planning. Our approach can be harnessed for other conditions that rely on histology for diagnosis and treatment.",Training;Graphical models;Histopathology;Manuals;Feature extraction;Planning;Artificial intelligence;Machine Learning;Causal Learning;Eosinophilic Esophagitis;Personalized Medicine;Treatment Assignment;Clinical Decision Support;Artificial Intelligence,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB),10.1109/CIBCB56990.2023.10264873
Ensemble Learning With Symbiotic Organism Search Optimization Algorithm for Breast Cancer Classification and Risk Identification of Other Organs on Histopathological Images,"Breast cancer (BC) is closely linked with the maximum mortality rate for cancer detection across the globe and has become a predominant public health issue. Earlier detection might increase the possibility of survival and successful treatment. However, it is a time-consuming and very challenging task that depends on the diagnostician’s experience. For patients and their prognosis, it is essential that BC cancer can be automatically detected by the analysis of histopathological images. Conventional feature extraction method extracts some lower-level features of images, and preceding knowledge is essential for selecting suitable features that could be heavily impacted by human beings. The deep learning (DL) technique extracts higher-level abstract features from an image automatically. Therefore, this study develops a new Ensemble Learning with Symbiotic Organism Search Optimization Algorithm for Breast Cancer Classification (ELSOSA-BCC) technique on Histopathological Images.

Rapid Turnaround Fabrication of Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)-Immobilized Nanowire Biosensors by O2-Plasma Assisted Lithography of e-Beam Resists,"Nucleic acid-based biosensors are useful to precisely detect genetic footprints at low concentrations with high specificity and selectivity. Among various sensing modalities, approaches based on direct electrical measurements offer advantages in label-free detection, portability for point-of care analysis, and direct integration with electronic readout circuits facilitating data processing, transfer and remote interpretation. In this work, we demonstrate a novel fabrication approach which couples conventional optical lithography and oxygen plasma-based etching with high-resolution electronbeam lithography to rapidly pattern poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) e-beam resist at varying feature sizes (i.e. both large and small device areas), which would otherwise require extremely long exposure durations up to days with standalone e-beam lithography. This allows fabrication of realistic biosensor chips in arrayed format, co-integrated with millimeter (mm)-scale electrical peripherals to nanoscale (nm) sensing elements utilizing a simple and high-throughput process. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by successful immobilization of thiol-functionalized peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes on $\sim 60$ nm-wide gold nanowires (AuNWs) enclosed in an SU-8 fluidic reservoir. Fabrication of biochips and self-assembly of PNA probes are characterized by optical microscope imaging, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).","Scanning electron microscopy;Spectroscopy;Biomedical optical imaging;Lithography;Optical device fabrication;Resists;Optical imaging;Electron beam lithography;O2 plasma;throughput;large-area patterning;gold;nanowire;biosensor;immobilization;peptide nucleic acid, thiol",INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE BioSensors Conference (BioSensors),10.1109/BioSensors58001.2023.10280935
Modeling Spectral Mixing for Geological Mixtures: Detecting Nonlinearly Mixed Pixels in Hyperspectral Image of Banded Hematite Quartzite,"Modeling spectral mixing for geological mixtures is challenging. The endmembers in these mixtures interact at a microscopic scale resulting in nonlinear mixing. Prior to applying inversion techniques for spectral unmixing, it is essential to identify the nature of nonlinear mixing that would facilitate a faster analysis of hyperspectral images for geological mixtures. This paper attempts pixel-wise nonlinearity detection of a hyperspectral image of a geological mixture (rock sample) collected in a controlled environment in the laboratory. The identified nonlinearly mixed regions were mapped and further validated through their spectral features in the principal component space. The insights obtained in this study would further support identifying the nature of mixing in geological mixtures.",Microscopy;Laboratories;Geoscience and remote sensing;Aerospace electronics;Rocks;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Spectral mixing;geological mixtures;microscopic scale;nonlinear mixing;nonlinearity detection,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,IGARSS 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,10.1109/IGARSS52108.2023.10283193
Unveiling the Future of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Diagnosis: An Innovative Hybrid AI Approach for Accurate Histopathological Image Analysis,"Oral cancer poses a formidable global health threat, demanding urgent attention to combat its devastating impact. Timely detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is pivotal for successful treatment and improved survival rates. However, manual histopathological analysis, reliant on the expertise of medical practitioners, can be time-consuming and vulnerable to subjective discrepancies. To surmount these challenges and elevate diagnostic outcomes, this research explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in OSCC diagnosis. Three distinct methodologies, namely Gabor + CatBoost, ResNet50 + CatBoost, and Gabor+ ResNet50 + CatBoost, were implemented to leverage the power of AI. By extracting 32 low-level features from the Gabor Filter and 100,532 high-level features from the ResNet50 model, the study adopts principal component analysis (PCA) to mitigate overfitting, retaining the top 4096 components. The extracted features underwent individual classification using CatBoost, followed by concatenation and image classification. Remarkably, the third strategy, which synergized Gabor filtering with ResNet50 feature extraction, along with CatBoost classification, demonstrated the most exceptional performance. Achieving an impressive accuracy of 94.92%, 95.51% precision, 84.30% sensitivity, 95.54% specificity, 94.90% F1 score, and 94.9% AUC, these AI-based approaches herald a new era of accurate and efficient OSCC diagnosis.",Cancer;Artificial intelligence;Feature extraction;Residual neural networks;Sensitivity;Medical diagnostic imaging;Training;Histopathology;Gabor filters;Histopathological images;CatBoost;gabor filter;OSCC;ResNet50 and PCA,ARTICLE,2023,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3326152
Densely U-Net Models for Human Embryo Segmentation,"Selection of viable embryo based on the morphological appearance is important for achieving higher success rate of in vitro fertilization treatment. Conventional grading of human embryo by clinical embryologists is prone to variety of expert experiences and subjectivities. Images taken using time-lapse microscopy could be graded using artificial intelligence techniques. As background of the embryo contains many artifacts, segmenting the embryos from the background of images is a crucial step for evaluating the quality of the embryo. In this study, we performed comparative analysis of human embryo (blastocyst) image segmentation using U-Net based architecture. Two modified U-Net architectures for image segmentation were implemented. The first model obtained by replacing the encoder or contraction section of U-Net with pretrained DenseNet121 models, while keeping the original U-Net decoder. The second model is worked out by replacing all convolutional blocks in the initial U-Net model with dense blocks while preserving the model's symmetry. The experimental result on the test set proved that the proposed modified U-Net model performed better than the original U-Net model. The best result was achieved for the second model called as Densely U-Net model with a 99.8% accuracy, 96.6% Dice Coefficient, 93.5% Jaccard Index and 96.9% Precision.",In vitro fertilization;Image segmentation;Embryo;Microscopy;Data models;Decoding;Indexes;Deep learning;U-Net;Dense-Net;in vitro fertilization;human embryo,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences (AiDAS),10.1109/AiDAS60501.2023.10284599

Addressing Uncertainty in Imbalanced Histopathology Image Classification of HER2 Breast Cancer: An Interpretable Ensemble Approach With Threshold Filtered Single Instance Evaluation (SIE),"Breast Cancer (BC) is among women’s most lethal health concerns. Early diagnosis can alleviate the mortality rate by helping patients make efficient treatment decisions. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER2) has become one the most lethal subtype of BC. According to the College of American Pathologists/American Society of Clinical Oncology (CAP/ASCO), the severity level of HER2 expression can be classified between 0 and 3+ range. HER2 can be detected effectively from immunohistochemical (IHC) and, hematoxylin & eosin (HE) images of different classes such as 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+. An ensemble approach integrated with threshold filtered single instance evaluation (SIE) technique has been proposed in this study to diagnose BC from the multi-categorical expression of HER2 subtypes. Initially, DenseNet201 and Xception have been ensembled into a single classifier as feature extractors with an effective combination of global average pooling, dropout layer, dense layer with a swish activation function, and l2 regularizer, batch normalization, etc. After that, extracted features has been processed through single instance evaluation (SIE) to determine different confidence levels and adjust decision boundary among the imbalanced classes. This study has been conducted on the BC immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset, which is classified by pathologists into four stages of HER2 BC. This proposed approach known as DenseNet201-Xception-SIE with a threshold value of 0.7 surpassed all other existing state-of-art models with an accuracy of 97.12%, precision of 97.15%, and recall of 97.68% on H&E data and, accuracy of 97.56%, precision of 97.57%, and recall of 98.00% on IHC data respectively, maintaining momentous improvement.

Characterizing surface phonon polaritons in quartz by near-field microscopy,"Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) are hybrid light-matter states originating from strong coupling between photons and optical phonons which are quasiparticles of lattice vibration. SPhP can be excited in the strong reflection bands in the infrared (IR) region (Reststrahlen region) of polar crystal, where the real part of the dielectric constant is negative. Control of SPhP is expected to be one of the promising ways to improve the thermal conductivity of nanoscale devices because the propagation length of SPhP is as long as $100 \mu m. SiC [1]$ and quartz [2, 3] are polar crystals that are often used for SPhP excitation. Due to crystal lattice vibrations inherent in a quartz [2], the reflectivity of a quartz is significantly decreased at around $1160 cm^{-1",Vibrations;Optical microscopy;Optical attenuators;Phonons;Crystals;Optical imaging;Reflection,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA),10.1109/ICEAA57318.2023.10297943

Active Learning Based Domain Adaptation for Tissue Segmentation of Histopathological Images,"Accurate segmentation of tissue in histopathological images can be very beneficial for defining regions of interest (ROI) for streamline of diagnostic and prognostic tasks. Still, adapting to different domains is essential for histopathology image analysis, as the visual characteristics of tissues can vary significantly across datasets. Yet, acquiring sufficient annotated data in the medical domain is cumbersome and time-consuming. The labeling effort can be significantly reduced by leveraging active learning, which enables the selective annotation of the most informative samples. Our proposed method allows for fine-tuning a pretrained deep neural network using a small set of labeled data from the target domain, while also actively selecting the most informative samples to label next. We demonstrate that our approach performs with significantly fewer labeled samples compared to traditional supervised learning approaches for similar F1-scores, using barely a 59% of the training set. We also investigate the distribution of class balance to establish annotation guidelines.",Training;Image segmentation;Visualization;Annotations;Supervised learning;Streaming media;Signal processing;Computational Pathology;Bladder Cancer;Multi-scale Segmentation;Active Learning;Domain Adaptation,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 31st European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO),10.23919/EUSIPCO58844.2023.10290058
Machine Learning Techniques For AFM-Based Imaging of Cells,"In recent years, advances in computer vision and machine learning have supported a series of algorithms, and their ability to decipher image contents is impressive. These algorithms are being applied to the study of cell images, and gradually changing the analysis methods of cell image data. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool for imaging and analyzing cell structures. It has been used to study the morphology, structure and mechanical properties of cells. However, it is still a challenging topic to identify cells based on AFM images. This article summarizes the applications of machine learning methods in the cell image analysis by AFM. The research of the cell analysis method begins with the collection of cell data, and it emphasizes to identifying cell types, carcinogenesis or carcinogenesis levels, and its auxiliary work includes the cell segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, generation and simulation.

Photoacoustic microscopy of sandstone reservoirs rocks,"The porosity of materials is an important parameter in several areas, ranging from industry to biomedicine. For sandstone rocks, the mineral composition is interesting in the oil industry and could be related to porosity and permeability. For example, the amount of rigid grains, such as quartz and feldspar, in sandstone composition can support the overload pressure, preserving the primary pores. Furthermore, the amount of feldspar could be positively correlated with porosity. On the other hand, mixtures of illite/smectite could reduce porosity. With the goal to investigate alternative techniques to analyze porous media, this work studies the application of photoacoustic microscopy in sandstone rocks. Photoacoustic microscopy is based on the photoacoustic effect, converting optical absorption into acoustic waves, and carrying both mechanical and optical information of the sample. Thus, the difference in optical absorption among the different minerals in sandstones could act as a contrast agent in the photoacoustic signal, allowing differentiation. Photoacoustic microscopy images were acquired in eleven sandstone rock samples to evaluate the intensity and frequency of the photoacoustic signal. The signal intensity was compared with photographs to analyze the mineral composition, and the signal frequency was used in morphology analysis.",Optical microscopy;Biomedical optical imaging;Absorption;Microscopy;Morphology;Rocks;Optical imaging;Sandstone Rocks;Photoacoustic Microscopy;Porosity;Mineral Composition;Morphology,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),10.1109/IUS51837.2023.10308378
Gland Segmentation in H&E Histopathological Images using U-Net with Attention Module,"Gland segmentation refers to the process of identifying and delineating glandular regions within histopathology images. However, gland segmentation in histopathology images is a challenging task due to several factors such as shape variations and overlapping structures. Despite numerous research efforts dedicated to addressing this challenge, it remains an unresolved problem. To address this issue, we introduce a deep gland segmentation method by designing an enhanced U-Net variant combined with an Attention module. By incorporating the Attention module into the U-Net architecture, the model becomes more adept at capturing contextual information and fine details within the histopathology images. To verify the effectiveness of the introduced method, we compare it with well-known semantic segmentation architectures on the GLAS and GRAG datasets. According to the results, our approach demonstrates a high success rate in gland segmentation, effectively competing with existing state-of-the-art methods.",Image segmentation;Sensitivity;Histopathology;Shape;Semantic segmentation;Glands;Computer architecture;U-Net;Attention module;gland segmentation;histopathological images,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,"2023 Twelfth International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)",10.1109/IPTA59101.2023.10320014
Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Classification Using Ensemble Feature Set,"Breast cancer accounts for 30% of newly diagnosed tumours due to lifestyle and genetic causes.

Histopathologists manually quantify mitosis, which is time-consuming and subjective. CAD, a secondary reader system, improves diagnosis and therapy. Recent technology advances have focused on mitosis detection utilising hand-crafted or CNN-learned characteristics. CNN-based techniques are computationally intensive, yet hand crafted features are inaccurate. Our technique combines Convolutional Neural Network-learned deep features with handcrafted features and employs an ensemble machine learning model to classify. The model was trained using MITOS-ATYPIA-14 grand challenge mitotic images. The model fed HC and deep features has an F1 score of 96%.

Integrated Multiscopic CPSS For Physical and Cognitive Measurement in an Independent Block-Design Test,"This paper presents an integrated multiscopic cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) for evaluating physical and cognitive aspects in an independent block-design test (BDT).

Second, an egocentric vision incorporating an eye tracker describes perceptual representation at the mesoscopic level. This system represents hand-eye coordination by measuring the distance between the hand and the center of visual attention during the test. Thirdly, an upper table vision system uses color feature recognition in each block to evaluate cognition at the macroscopic level. This system detects the blocks and recognizes that the design matches the task given. By evaluating eight designs of WAIS-IV BDT, our system has demonstrated its ability to measure physical and cognitive variables during the BDT successfully.

Estimation of Surface Roughness Using AFM Image Adopting 2D FFT and Wavelet Analysis,Surface discharge studies were carried out with silicone rubber added with 3wt% nano boron nitride composites. The study innovatively involves the frequency domain image analysis for estimating the nanoscale surface roughness of silicone rubber nanocomposites and thereby average surface roughness can be predicted using it as a texture feature. Five frequency domain parameters were extracted from two-dimensional surface morphological atomic force microscopy images. The two-dimensional Fast Fourier transform is used to extract the roughness features in the spatial frequency domain. The 2D frequency parameters and AFM roughness parameters are statistically correlated and correlate well with the experimental results. The prediction is high when the average power spectrum and central power spectrum percentage parameter of the AFM image are used for the regression model.

Decoding Ensemble Spike States from Extracellular Field Potentials,"Behaviors are encoded by multi-scale brain signals, from microscopic spike signals to macroscopic extracellular Field Potentials (FPs). Extracting neuronal spike information from FPs is an important, yet challenging problem. Because FPs stem from summed contributions of a large population of neurons. Previous work inferred single-neuron spiking activity from the FPs using a generalized linear model (GLM). However, FPs reflect the states of neural ensembles more than single-neuron spike trains. In this paper, we propose a computational model to decode ensemble spike states from FPs. This framework first extracts transient features in FPs, and then detects typical ensemble spike patterns and assigns state labels accordingly. Finally, we use a neural network to decode the ensemble spike states from the FP neuromodulations. This FP-Spike decoder is tested on the FP and spike data from the M1 area of an SD rat. We show that our model can effectively decode multi-neuron spike states. Compared with the GLM method for single-neuron spike prediction, our model exhibits 37% less ensemble spike pattern decoding error. These preliminary results show that we can decode informative spike states from FPs, indicating that the decode results can further benefit long-term stable brain-machine interfaces.",Computational modeling;Sociology;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Decoding;Data mining;Statistics;multiscale neural signal;spike-field relationship;latent brain states;neuron populations states,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 45th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341044
Lymphoma Recognition in Histology Image of Gastric Mucosal Biopsy with Prototype Learning,"Lymphomas are a group of malignant tumors developed from lymphocytes, which may occur in many organs. Therefore, accurately distinguishing lymphoma from solid tumors is of great clinical significance. Due to the strong ability of graph structure to capture the topology of the micro-environment of cells, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used in pathological image processing. Nevertheless, the softmax classification layer of the graph convolutional models cannot drive learned representations compact enough to distinguish some types of lymphomas and solid tumors with strong morphological analogies on H&E-stained images. To alleviate this problem, a prototype learning based model is proposed, namely graph convolutional prototype network (GCPNet). Specifically, the method follows the patch-to-slide architecture first to perform patch-level classification and obtain image-level results by fusing patch-level predictions. The classification model is assembled with a graph convolutional feature extractor and prototype-based classification layer to build more robust feature representations for classification. For model training, a dynamic prototype loss is proposed to give the model different optimization priorities at different stages of training. Besides, a prototype reassignment operation is designed to prevent the model from getting stuck in local minima during optimization. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of 183 Whole slide images (WSI) of gastric mucosa biopsy. The proposed method achieved superior performance than existing methods.Clinical relevance— The work proposed a new deep learning framework tailored to lymphoma recognition on pathological image of gastric mucosal biopsy to differentiate lymphoma, adenocarcinoma and inflammation.",Training;Solid modeling;Image recognition;Biological system modeling;Biopsy;Prototypes;Feature extraction;Lymphoma;Whole slide image;Graph convolutional network;Prototype learning,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 45th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340697
In vitro laser scanning confocal microscopy and unsupervised segmentation: Quantification of cytosolic calcium and RNA distribution in hypoxic neurons,"The mimicry of neurodegenerative diseases in vitro can be observed through the induction of chronic hypoxia, and the impact of this stress is monitored using multiplexed imaging techniques. While laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) is a valuable tool for observing single neurons under degenerative conditions, accurately quantifying RNA distribution and cell size by deep learning tools remains challenging due to the lack of annotated training datasets. To address this, we propose a framework that combines 3D tracking of RNA distribution and cell size identification using unsupervised image segmentation. Additionally, we quantified the calcium level in neurons using fluorescent microscopy using unsupervised image segmentation. First, we performed imaging of neuronal morphology using differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and RNA/calcium level imaging using fluorescent microscopy. Next, we performed k-means clustering-based cell segmentation. The results show that our framework can distinguish between distinct neuronal states under control and chronic hypoxic conditions. The analysis reveals that hypoxia induces a significant increase in cytosolic calcium level, reduction in neuron diameter, and alterations in RNA distribution.Clinical Relevance— The proposed framework is crucial to study the neurodegeneration process and evaluating the efficacy of neuroprotective drugs through image analysis.",Image segmentation;Optical microscopy;RNA;Microscopy;Calcium;Neurons;Lasers,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 45th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340952
Immunohistochemistry Biomarkers-Guided Image Search for Histopathology,"Medical practitioners use a number of diagnostic tests to make a reliable diagnosis. Traditionally, Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained glass slides have been used for cancer diagnosis and tumor detection. However, recently a variety of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides can be requested by pathologists to examine and confirm diagnoses for determining the subtype of a tumor when this is difficult using H&E slides only. Deep learning (DL) has received a lot of interest recently for image search engines to extract features from tissue regions, which may or may not be the target region for diagnosis. This approach generally fails to capture high-level patterns corresponding to the malignant or abnormal content of histopathology images. In this work, we are proposing a targeted image search approach, inspired by the pathologists’ workflow, which may use information from multiple IHC biomarker images when available. These IHC images could be aligned, filtered, and merged together to generate a composite biomarker image (CBI) that could eventually be used to generate an attention map to guide the search engine for localized search. In our experiments, we observed that an IHC-guided image search engine can retrieve relevant data more accurately than a conventional (i.e., H&E-only) search engine without IHC guidance. Moreover, such engines are also able to accurately conclude the subtypes through majority votes.",Histopathology;Search engines;Feature extraction;Reliability;Cancer;Tumors;Immune system;Image Retrieval;Image Search;Histopathology;Immunohistochemistry;Biomarkers;Digital Pathology;Fuzzy Inference,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 45th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340099
Identification and Analysis of Imaging-Genomic Signatures to Study Recurrence in Breast Cancers,"One of the main causes of breast cancer related death is its recurrence. In this study, we investigate the association of gene expression and pathological image features to understand breast cancer recurrence. A total of 172 breast cancer patient data was downloaded from the TCGA-BRCA database. The dataset contained diagnostic whole slide images and RNA-seq data of 80 recurrent and 92 disease-free breast cancer patients. We performed genomic analysis on RNA-seq data to obtain the hub genes related to recurrent breast cancer. We extracted relevant pathomic features from histopathology images. The discriminative ability of the hub genes and pathomic features were evaluated using machine learning classifiers. We used Spearman rank correlation analysis to find statistically significant association between gene expression and pathomic features. We identified that, genes which are related to breast cancer progression is significantly associated (adjusted p-value<0.05) with several pathomic features.Clinical Relevance— Histopathology is the gold standard for cancer detection. It provides us with cellular level information. A strong association between a pathomic feature and a gene expression will help clinicians understand the cellular and molecular mechanism of cancer for better prognosis.",Correlation;Histopathology;Genomics;Imaging;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Gene expression,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 45th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10339965

Raman spectroscopy and microscopy are powerful tools to visualize and monitor the quality of CNTs and evaluate their distribution inside cells, providing valuable information for the development of effective carbon nanotube-based therapies. However, the features obtained from Raman spectra are quite dependent on each other, and their simultaneous presence is often redundant.

Towards control of Dielectric Properties in Single-Layer WS2via Defect Density Engineering,"Tungsten disulfide (WS2) possesses attractive optical and electronic properties, which make it a promising candidate for a wide range of applications. However, upon growth it exhibits an intrinsic variety of defects, affecting its electronic and optical characteristics. This study focuses on the control of dielectric properties of WS2 via defect density engineering. In particular, we investigate atomically thin WS2, grown via liquid phase chemical vapour deposition (LiP-CVD).

RC R-CNN for Bone Marrow Cell Recognition,"The morphological examination of bone marrow (BM) cells is an essential basis for the diagnosis and assessment of hematologic diseases. However, manual recognition of cell class and quantification in microscopic images of BM cells is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. Therefore, it is crucial to study an efficient algorithm for the automatic recognition of BM cells. Clinically, to determine the BM cell classes, experienced examiners usually rely on surrounding cells as references to provide auxiliary confirmation, but there is no model specially designed for contextual relationships of BM cells. To extract cell features comprehensively and explore the contextual relationships among BM cells, we propose RC RCNN based on Mask R-CNN, which includes positional encoding (PE), ROI self-attention module (RSAM), and ROI channel attention module (RCAM) as an extension to Mask RCNN. The PE and RCAM enable better capturing of contextual information between BM cells. By using the RSAM, the model directs its attention toward internal cell features while effectively suppressing irrelevant background information. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method, with the AP and F1-Score reaching 73.21% and 87.71%, respectively, an improvement of about 2.3% and 2.2% over the baseline.",Image recognition;Microscopy;Morphology;Cells (biology);Manuals;Feature extraction;Bones;bone marrow cell recognition;Mask R-CNN;self-attention;contextual relationships,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 35th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI),10.1109/ICTAI59109.2023.00127
ALFA – Leveraging All Levels of Feature Abstraction for Enhancing the Generalization of Histopathology Image Classification Across Unseen Hospitals,"We propose an exhaustive methodology that leverages all levels of feature abstraction, targeting an enhancement in the generalizability of image classification to unobserved hospitals. Our approach incorporates augmentation-based self-supervision with common distribution shifts in histopathology scenarios serving as the pretext task. This enables us to derive invariant features from training images without relying on training labels, thereby covering different abstraction levels. Moving onto the subsequent abstraction level, we employ a domain alignment module to facilitate further extraction of invariant features across varying training hospitals. To represent the highly specific features of participating hospitals, an encoder is trained to classify hospital labels, independent of their diagnostic labels. The features from each of these encoders are subsequently disentangled to minimize redundancy and segregate the features. This representation, which spans a broad spectrum of semantic information, enables the development of a model demonstrating increased robustness to unseen images from disparate distributions. Experimental results from the PACS dataset (a domain generalization benchmark), a synthetic dataset created by applying histopathology-specific jitters to the MHIST dataset (defining different domains with varied distribution shifts), and a Renal Cell Carcinoma dataset derived from four image repositories from TCGA, collectively indicate that our proposed model is adept at managing varying levels of image granularity. Thus, it shows improved generalizability when faced with new, out-of-distribution hospital images.

Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation: Optimizing Cross-Entropy Weights and Post-Processing with Autoencoders,"The task of medical image segmentation presents unique challenges, necessitating both localized and holistic semantic understanding to accurately delineate areas of interest, such as critical tissues or aberrant features. This complexity is heightened in medical image segmentation due to the high degree of inter-class similarities, intra-class variations, and possible image obfuscation. The segmentation task further diversifies when considering the study of histopathology slides for autoimmune diseases like dermatomyositis. The analysis of cell inflammation and interaction in these cases has been less studied due to constraints in data acquisition pipelines. Despite the progressive strides in medical science, we lack a comprehensive collection of autoimmune diseases. As autoimmune diseases globally escalate in prevalence and exhibit associations with COVID-19, their study becomes increasingly essential. While there is existing research that integrates artificial intelligence in the analysis of various autoimmune diseases, the exploration of dermatomyositis remains relatively underrepresented. In this paper, we present a deep-learning approach tailored for Medical image segmentation. Our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques by an average of 12.26% for U-Net and 12.04% for U-Net++ across the ResNet family of encoders on the dermatomyositis dataset.

Towards Fixing Clever-Hans Predictors with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation,"This paper introduces a novel technique called counterfactual knowledge distillation (CFKD) to detect and remove reliance on confounders in deep learning models with the help of human expert feedback. Confounders are spurious features that models tend to rely on, which can result in unexpected errors in regulated or safety-critical domains. The paper highlights the benefit of CFKD in such domains and shows some advantages of counterfactual explanations over other types of explanations. We propose an experiment scheme to quantitatively evaluate the success of CFKD and different teachers that can give feedback to the model. We also introduce a new metric that is better correlated with true test performance than validation accuracy.

It optimizes parameters of the two-dimensional bandpass filter, crucial for addressing challenges with thin, elongated cells. The bandpass segmentation, ranking second in the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC) 2020 for rat MSC segmentation, indicates potential performance improvement through parameter optimization. The optimization involves two Gaussian filters and a tophat filter, utilizing a grid search and perceptron model on the Fluo-C2DL-MSC dataset in the CTC.

MAgic: A Morphable Attention Based Algal Tiny Object Detection Model,"The dense and toxic blooms formed by cyanobacteria in the aquatic environment have caused serious damage to public health and aquatic ecosystems. It is crucial to monitor and prevent cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater waters in a timely manner. Although the object detection method has been applied to the field of algae identification, there are some issues to be solved in the existing research. The main challenge is that the setting of the training set is too idealistic, which is separated from the actual water quality environment and cannot guide the actual algae identification and water quality monitoring. In this paper, we collect 2,024 algae microscopic images of algae from a reservoir in southern China and a data set for object detection. Aiming at the above problems, we proposed a morphable attention based algal tiny object detection strategy to sample and extract features of algae small targets more effectively. It is hoped that the model training and improvement results of this paper can help to establish a future algae real-time monitoring and water quality evaluation system.",Training;Social computing;Computational modeling;Algae;Object detection;Water quality;Feature extraction;cyanobacterial blooms;water quality evaluation;algal detection;object detection;computer vision,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 10th International Conference on Behavioural and Social Computing (BESC),10.1109/BESC59560.2023.10386562
Biomarker discovery using multimodal data with the potential application in lung tumor diagnosis,"Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in humans, with very high morbidity and mortality. Accurately identifying the lung tumor markers can significantly improve the diagnostic capability of lung cancer, which helps clinicians detect potential lung cancer lesions earlier and take a more timely and effective treatment regime, thus improving the survival rate and quality of life of cancer patients. Recently, there has been growing interest in biomarker discovery based on multi-omics and multimodal data, which explore high-dimensional, high-throughput, and multi-scale biomedical data of lung cancer patients from various perspectives, including molecular, histopathology, radiology, and clinical records. Additionally, machine learning (ML) techniques can handle complex multi-omics and multimodal data more efficiently than traditional biomarker discovery methods, so ML has been widely adopted in finding lung cancer biomarkers. This paper reviews biomarker discovery using multimodal data with the potential application in lung tumor diagnosis. Specifically, we comprehensively summarize and analyze the current research status of biomarker discovery from three aspects, including multimodal data feature extraction and selection, multimodal integration methods, and biomarker discovery methods.

Stain Normalization and Augmentation in Frequency Space for Histology Analysis,"Histopathology plays an indispensable role in cancer diagnosis. However, the frequent staining variations observed in tissue slides pose significant challenges to the effectiveness of computer-aided diagnostic systems. Stain Normalization (SN) and Stain Augmentation (SA) have been proposed to mitigate these issues. Traditional SN techniques focused on minimizing variations between slides, whereas SA sought to enhance data distribution without changing the inherent morphology, mainly within the image domain. Notably, many medical signals originate from frequency information, often processed in specialized facilities. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel approach: harnessing the frequency domain for SN and SA. Our proposed Fourier Stain Normalization (F-SN) and Fourier Stain Augmentation (FSA) methods innovatively mark a significant departure from conventional techniques by leveraging the focus on the frequency domain. Through the application of Fourier transformation, we transmute time-domain signals into the frequency domain, resulting in a streamlined and more efficient preprocessing phase compared to time-domain-based methodologies. Enhancing this approach, we incorporate a learnable mask prediction mechanism, adeptly merging source and target images, which bolsters its adaptability for a spectrum of downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations spanning medical image classification and segmentation using diverse network architectures, affirm the superiority of our F-SN and F-SA techniques over traditional time-domain methods, underscoring the frequency domain’s richer informational content.

CVFC: Attention-Based Cross-View Feature Consistency for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Pathology Images,"Histopathology image segmentation is the gold standard for diagnosing cancer, and can indicate cancer prognosis. However, histopathology image segmentation requires high-quality masks, so many studies now use image-level labels to achieve pixel-level segmentation to reduce the need for fine-grained annotation. To solve this problem, we propose an attention-based cross-view feature consistency end-to-end pseudo-mask generation framework named CVFC based on the attention mechanism. Specifically, CVFC is a three-branch joint framework composed of two Resnet38 and one Resnet50, and the independent branch multi-scale integrated feature map to generate a class activation map (CAM); in each branch, through down-sampling and The expansion method adjusts the size of the CAM; the middle branch projects the feature matrix to the query and key feature spaces, and generates a feature space perception matrix through the connection layer and inner product to adjust and refine the CAM of each branch; finally, through the feature consistency loss and feature cross loss to optimize the parameters of CVFC in co-training mode. After a large number of experiments, An IoU of 0.7122 and a fwIoU of 0.7018 are obtained on the WSSS4LUAD dataset, which outperforms HistoSegNet, SEAM, C-CAM, WSSS-Tissue, and OEEM, respectively.",Histopathology;Semantic segmentation;Prognostics and health management;Bioinformatics;Residual neural networks;Cancer;Biomedical imaging;Histopathology Image;Segmentation;CAM;Consistency;Weak supervision,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM58861.2023.10385357
Histopathological Cancer Detection with Topological Signatures,"We present a transformative approach to histopathological cancer detection and grading by introducing a very powerful feature extraction method based on the latest topological data analysis tools.

While most DL models work well for one type of cancer, our model easily adapts to different scenarios, and consistently gives highly competitive results with the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets across multiple cancer types including bone, colon, breast, cervical (cytopathology), and prostate cancer.

CAMPEOD: A Cross Attention-Based Multi-Scale Patch Embedding Organoid Detection Model,"In medical research, organoids, which exhibit structural and functional resemblances to authentic organs, offer a substantial avenue for delving into aspects encompassing physiology, pathophysiology, diseases, and pharmaceutical screening. Critical insights into drug responsiveness are often gleaned from these organoids' dimensional and configurational disparities. However, conventional detection methodologies reliant upon fluorescent labeling engender potential hazards to organoid integrity, thereby impinging upon their intrinsic dynamic attributes. Traditional bounding-box detection methodologies fall short in encapsulating intricate morphological particulars, and certain deep-learning approaches grapple with the intricate task of capturing multi-scale data, particularly when tasked with discerning organoid structures characterized by marked shape and size heterogeneities. In a bid to surmount these constraints, our study introduces CAMPEOD, an innovative framework that synergistically amalgamates multi-scale attributes derived from organoid specimens, employing cross-attention mechanisms. This novel approach effectively obviates superfluous background interference and image noise, thereby endowing an automated, finely-tuned dissection of organoid samples. Significantly, this segmentation process ensures congruence with authentic organoid quantities and morphological characteristics. By facilitating comprehensive scrutiny of microscopy images of organoid samples on a large scale, CAMPEOD assumes considerable implications for the realm of pharmaceutical screening and ailment emulation.",Training;Image segmentation;Tracking;Shape;Motion segmentation;Microscopy;Interference;organoids;cross-attention;segmentation;multi-scale;automated,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),10.1109/BIBM58861.2023.10385689
Self-distillation Augmented Masked Autoencoders for Histopathological Image Understanding,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has drawn increasing attention in histopathological image analysis in recent years. Compared to contrastive learning which is troubled with the false negative problem, i.e., semantically similar images are selected as negative samples, masked autoencoders (MAE) build SSL from a generative paradigm which is probably a more appropriate pretraining. In this paper, we introduce MAE to histopathological image understanding, and moreover, verify the effect of visible patches in this task. Specifically, a novel SD-MAE model is proposed to enable a self-distillation augmented MAE. Besides the reconstruction loss on masked image patches, SD-MAE further imposes the self-distillation loss on visible patches to enhance the representational capacity of encoder located in the shallow layers. It generates a more effective feature pre-training and benefits downstream applications. We apply SD-MAE to histopathological image classification, cell segmentation and cell detection. Experiments demonstrate that SD-MAE shows highly competitive performance compared with other SSL methods in these tasks.

Few-Shot Fine-Grained Classification of Histological Images,"Histological image classification plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis. However, the acquisition of well-labeled histological images is prohibitively expensive, and obtaining rare abnormal samples is challenging. Therefore, applying few-shot learning methods to histological image classification tasks holds significant clinical value. Nevertheless, existing research predom-inantly relies on coarse-grained image classification approaches based on natural image datasets, which struggle to address the fine-grained challenges encountered in histological image classification, such as intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity. To tackle this issue, this study proposes a novel few-shot fine-grained classification method for histological images, named “Category-Aware Feature Map Reconstruction Network.” This method employs channel weights to localize the differences between inter-class and intra-class regions, composed of intra-class channel weights and inter-class channel weights, collectively referred to as category-aware weights. Specifically, intra-class channel weights indicate the matching degree of salient regions within the support set of a particular class, while inter-class channel weights represent the degree of containing distinct information between classes. The category-aware weights are utilized to transform the support feature maps and query feature maps, generating feature maps that capture differentiating details between categories. Finally, the distance between the transformed query feature map and support feature map is calculated to achieve probabilistic predictions for the categories. On a histological few-shot dataset, this method achieves an accuracy of 90.23% using ResNet-12 as the feature extractor, surpassing the baseline model by 5.24% and outperforming other few-shot methods by at least 10% in the 5-way 10-shot experimental setting. The proposed method exhibits exceptional performance on histological image few-shot datasets, playing a vital role in more accurate and pathologist-independent cancer diagnosis.",Training;Transforms;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Image reconstruction;Cancer;Image classification;Computer-aided diagnosis;Few-shot learning;Fine-grained classification;Histological image classification;Convolutional neural networks;Attention mechanism,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE International Conference on Medical Artificial Intelligence (MedAI),10.1109/MedAI59581.2023.00056

How Do Norms and Noise Impact Clustering Results? A Robustness Analysis Applied to Digital Pathology,"In real-world scenarios, where datasets often lack strong annotations, unsupervised learning enables the discovery of new knowledge from unlabeled data. However, in the unsupervised field, a challenging issue is the uncertain robustness of the obtained clusters since noisy data and different algorithms and settings could lead to different results. Therefore, to face this challenge, we employed unsupervised machine learning techniques with the dual aim of evaluating the robustness to noise and norm changes of unsupervised clustering techniques. To do this, a real-world dataset composed of histopathological images of colon cancer patients was employed in the analysis. First-order and texture features were extracted patch-wise from each patient, aggregated at the patient level, and used as input of two unsupervised algorithms, i.e., dendrogram and self-organizing map (SOM). Keeping fixed the clustering algorithm and settings, we compared in terms of Rand Index (RI) the results obtained using 1) original and noisy features and 2) different norms. In addition, we assessed the correlation of the clustering results to the Microsatellite Instability (MSI) status. Results showed that the L2-based SOM and both L1 and L2-based dendrograms seem to be not affected by noise (respectively 70%, 68%, and 63% RI). Moreover, the obtained results were highly similar when comparing the use of L1 and L2 Norm for both dendrograms and SOMs (respectively 78% and 75% RI). In the MSI correlation analysis, the SOM obtained a moderate correlation (0.30) that tended to zero when the norm was changed or noise was added, while dendrograms, on the other hand, yielded more robust correlation values.",Self-organizing feature maps;Correlation;Perturbation methods;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Robustness;Noise measurement;Unsupervised clustering;machine learning;robustness;digital pathology;colon cancer,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE),10.1109/BIBE60311.2023.00061

Breast Cancer Histopathology Images Classification Based on Masked Autoencoders and Knowledge Distillation,"Breast cancer ranks among the most prevalent malignancies affecting women. Precise differentiation between benign and malignant histopathological images holds pivotal significance for the timely diagnosis and effective treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer histopathology images present challenges due to patient privacy concerns and the intricate process of collection. Moreover, the manual annotation of these images necessitates significant human and material resources, contributing to an insufficient dataset for network training. Concurrently, the escalating intricacy of breast cancer histopathology image classification tasks demands more extensive networks for efficient handling.

Color and texture feature fusion for breast cancer classification using histopathology images,"Recent advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision have made it possible to create computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to detect breast cancer using histopathology images. In this research, a classification framework for breast cancer has been developed using histopathology images. In this regard, the color and texture features of the images are utilized for classification using several machine learning (ML) classifiers. For texture, three handcrafted feature extraction techniques, such as Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Gabor have been investigated. Similarly, for color features, HSV histogram features and H, S, and V values of the HSV color model are used to classify the images. The features extracted from each method are evaluated individually. The best derived methods are combined and feed into different ML classifiers. The performance of each classifier is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score. It is observed that LBP and HSV histogram with XGB classifier obtained an accuracy of 87.50% and 83.62%, respectively. After fusing the LBP and HSV histogram features with the XGB classifier obtained an accuracy of 93.34%. The experiment is carried out on the BreakHis dataset.

A lightweight pathological image segmentation framework based on heterogeneous cross-layer sampling,"Pathological image segmentation is an essential step in the early detection and diagnosis of various diseases. The features of high resolution, complex background structure, and different tissue shape and size of pathological images, bring great challenges to the segmentation algorithm of pathological images. Deep learning is proved to be an effective method for the segmentation of pathological images. However, there are still some difficulties such as poor capture ability of lesion characteristics and complex model parameters. To solve the above problems, this paper designs a lightweight segmentation network framework for pathological image, called HES-UNet. The framework employs a learning mode of heterogeneous cross-layer sampling and feature capture, which improves computational efficiency while guaranteeing the performance of image segmentation. The way of heterogeneous cross-layer sampling is used in the encoder and decoder to perform only two feature extractions at large and small scales, which greatly reduces the number of parameters of the model. And after drastic dimensional changes, an attention mechanism is adopted for a global feature and local feature capture to improve the learning ability of the network on pathological features and the performance of image segmentation algorithm. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed segmentation framework, we conducted experiments on three different datasets. The experimental results show that the network outperforms the contrast algorithm on segmentation performance and efficiency to obtain more accurate segmentation results. Compared with the standard UNet3+, the number of parameters can be reduced to 1/39 of the original. It is indicated that our proposed segmentation framework not only has efficient segmentation performance, but also has good generalization ability.",Image segmentation;Pathology;Cross layer design;Shape;Computational modeling;Computational efficiency;Standards;pathological image segmentation;lightweight;cross-layer sampling;attention mechanism,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 IEEE Smart World Congress (SWC),10.1109/SWC57546.2023.10448845
Hardware Deployable Classifier for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma using Tiny Machine Learning Model,"Breast Cancer is a global health concern, emphasizing the crucial importance of its early detection in improving patient treatment. This is especially true for the most frequently diagnosed type of breast cancer, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), which has a high risk of spreading and significant mortality. Automation provides an opportunity to streamline the detection, improving efficiency and minimizing diagnostic errors. In this research paper, we proposed a low-computational Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) model for the classification of IDC. Conventional methods for IDC classification, such as histopathological analysis and mammography, are time-consuming, costly, and subjective. Therefore, there is a need for an automated and accurate method for IDC classification that can be applied in a resource-limited environment. Our proposed TinyML model takes digital images of whole-mount breast cancer slide specimens and extracts the features necessary to classify them as IDC-(-ve) or IDC-(+ve). The TinyML model is evaluated using a publicly available dataset of Breast Histopathology Images and compared to the other Deep Learning (DL) models based on accuracy and computational complexity. The results show that our model achieved a high accuracy of 89.3% while maintaining limited processing power and memory. The successful deployment of the model on an embedded system like Raspberry Pi demonstrates that our TinyML model can be used in hardware resource- constrained environments, promising improved cancer diagnosis.",Embedded systems;Histopathology;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Medical treatment;Feature extraction;Breast cancer;Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM);Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Deep Learning (DL);Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC);Multilayer Perceptron (MLP);Raspberry Pi;Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML),INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 16th International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST),10.1109/ICST59744.2023.10460815

A Proposed Framework for Improving the Detection and Classification of Ki67 Expression in Astrocytoma Histopathological Images,"Detecting and classifying the Ki67 expression is a challenging process. The inconsistency in staining intensity and the variations in image quality are the main factors that may reduce the performance of an automated system. Therefore, this study proposes a framework that objectively improves detecting and classifying Ki67 expression in astrocytoma histopathological images. The proposed framework began with implementing the double stain normalization procedure to reduce the colour-staining intensity variations. Then, the system automatically enhanced the morphological features of the Ki67 expression. The following step was to segment the enhanced images by using the U-Net network model.

Optimization of Random Forest Hyperparameters with Genetic Algorithm in Classification of Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer is a type of cancer with the highest death rate compared to other cancers. Cancer can be classified using histopathological methods which are obtained using biopsies. Manual classification of cancer on histopathological images is work intensive and highly susceptible to human error. Cancer classification from histopathological images can be done using computer assistance using computer vision and machine learning. This research proposes the following stages: data collection, feature extraction from images, feature selection, building a Random Forest model, optimizing hyperparameters using a Genetic Algorithm, and evaluating the performance of the model. The histopathological images that have been collected will have their color and texture features extracted. The extraction process produces 9 RGB features and 9 HSV features for color features. Meanwhile, texture features produce 6 types of features, namely dissimilarity, correlation, homogeneity, contrast, ASM, and energy, which are then searched for values from four different angles to produce 24 texture features. A total of 42 features were produced. All these features are then selected using the correlation coefficient and the remaining 24 features will be used to build a classification model using Random Forest. The classification model that has been built is then optimized by setting hyperparameters automatically so that the resulting model is reliable and better than general models. The hyperparameters that are optimized are $n$ estimators, max depth, max features, and criterion. By using a Genetic Algorithm, all hyperparameters are adjusted automatically to get hyperparameters with the best model performance. The Random Forest model with hyperparameters with default values succeeded in getting an accuracy of 98.82 % and a 10-fold cross-validation value of 99.39%. Meanwhile, the model that has been optimized using the Genetic Algorithm with the best hyperparameters $n$ estimators = 300, max depth = 100, max features = log2, and criterion = entropy produces an accuracy of 98.83% and a 10-fold cross-validation value of 99.50%. The Random Forest model with hyperparameters optimized using the Genetic Algorithm succeeded in outperforming the Random Forest model with default hyperparameters. It is proven that optimizing hyperparameters using a Genetic Algorithm can improve the performance of the Random Forest model.",Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Lung cancer;Feature extraction;Entropy;Data models;Reliability;lung cancer;histopathology;cancer classification;Random Forest;Genetic Algorithm,INPROCEEDINGS,2023,2023 6th International Seminar on Research of Information Technology and Intelligent Systems (ISRITI),10.1109/ISRITI60336.2023.10467686
