  abstract={This paper introduces a kind of cancer cells in pleural fluid microscopic images processing and fuzzy recognizing method. We propose a method, which firstly segments the image using the OTSU thresholding method and fuzzy edge detection, then extracts 7 measurement parameters i.e. the area rate of the karyon and cytoplasm, the optic density, the shape factor and else, finally uses fuzzy pattern recognition which is based on establishing 6 membership functions and 4 normative modes to recognize the cancer cells. Experiments show that this system provides valuable suggestions to the diagnosis of cancer.},

  abstract={Coupling between electrical and mechanical phenomena is a near-universal characteristic of inorganic and biological systems alike, with examples ranging from piezoelectricity in ferroelectric perovskites to complex, electromechanical couplings in electromotor proteins in cellular membranes. Understanding electromechanical functionality in materials such as ferroelectric nanocrystals and thin films, relaxor ferroelectrics, and biosystems requires probing these properties on the nanometer level of individual grain, domain, or protein fibril. In the last decade, piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) was established as a powerful tool for nanoscale imaging, spectroscopy, and manipulation of ferroelectric materials. Here, we present principles and recent advances in PFM, including vector and frequency-dependent imaging of piezoelectric materials, briefly review applications for ferroelectric materials, discuss prospects for electromechanical imaging of local crystallographic and molecular orientations and disorder, and summarize future challenges and opportunities for PFM emerging in the second decade since its invention},

  title={A Statistical Study of Sn Whisker Population and Growth During Elevated Temperature and Humidity Tests}, 
  year={2006},
  volume={29},
  number={4},
  pages={246-251},
  abstract={Storage tests at elevated temperature and humidity conditions have been widely adopted as one of the major acceleration tests for Sn whisker growth. However, the driving force associated and the nucleation and growth process of whiskers are yet to be fully understood. In this paper, Sn whisker growth on Cu leadframe material at two different test conditions is compared. Both loose and board-mounted components were used. At each read point, the length and location of every whisker observed was recorded. Statistical characteristics and growth rate of the whisker population will be presented for each of the tests conditions. On loose components, corrosion of the Sn finish was observed near the tip and the dam bar cut area of the leads with backscatter scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy. The entire population of whiskers was located in these corroded areas, and there were zero whiskers located in the noncorroded areas on the same leads. On board-mounted components, the corrosion level of the Sn finish, as well as the whisker population and length was greatly reduced compared to those on the loose components. These results suggest that the corrosion of Sn finish in high-temperature and high-humidity conditions is the major driving force for whisker growth. The cause for the difference between the loose and board-mounted components is also analyzed},

This is a non-invasive method to microscopy biology samples in order to recognize them. We generate the hologram from the 2D digital images of blood cells and make the reconstruction of leukemia cell through a computer simulation. We utilize approximate Fresnel digital holography in order to simulate optical diffraction patterns of hologram. A feature selection process is done on a computer reconstructed holographic image where we use the Zernike moments as the features of digital image. We take advantage of the rotation invariant property of the Zernike moments in the recognition of leukemia cell due to its unknown rotational direction. We compute the Zernike moments from scale and translation invariant geometric moments. In order to classify the leukemia cell, we use the minimum mean distance and the K-nearest neighbor methods using the invariant features},

  abstract={Piezoelectric AlN thin film has been considered for fabricating the thin film bulk acoustic wave resonator (FBAR) for over years. Characterization of thin film material properties including density, elastic modulus, and piezoelectric coefficient are essential in processing study and for predicting the performance of the acoustic wave devices. In this paper, the authors present our results on the fabrication of highly c-axis oriented AlN thin films on Pt/Ti/Si (100) and Pt/Ti/sapphire (002) substrates by DC reactive magnetron sputtering method. The crystalline structure and the surface morphology of AlN films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effective piezoelectric coefficient d33eff of the AlN films on the sapphire substrate were measured by the laser interferometer method and the piezoelectric coefficient d33 was calculated. In addition, a more detailed characterization on the mechanical properties was performed by using a recently developed resonance spectrum method. Based on the impedance spectrum, the density and elastic constant of the piezoelectric AlN thin film in the four-layer composite resonator structure were evaluated. The calculated results reveal that the piezoelectric coefficient d33, density and velocity of the AlN thin film are 4.19pm/V, 3187.3kg/m3, and 10631m/s respectively},

  abstract={We report a single tungsten nanowire successfully grown by controlling the distance between the emitter and substrates with a robotic nanomanipulator moved at a speed of 15 nm/s. When we draw the emitter far from the substrates during electron emission, the longest nanowire at the tip can grow continually, because the electron field at the tip is stronger than the other parts of nanowires. Although multiple nanowires grow at the beginning, the result is that only one nanowire can grow continually at the tip of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We also show tree-like nanowires on the tip of a CNT without inter-electrode control. These nanowires were induced by field emission, with tungsten hexacarbonyl as precursors. The nanowire's geometric properties were characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and its composition was detected with TEM energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). The EDS spectrum showed that the nanowires are mainly made of tungsten and carbon. The degradation of CNT emitter is an important problem and influences the device's stability and lifetime. We propose that the growth of nanowires can be used for modifying degraded emitters},

Atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for the analysis of the morphology, electrical properties and composition of ITO layers deposited on Corning glass at different temperatures and subsequently subjected to hydrogen plasma. Formation of highly conductive nano-structures at hydrogenation temperatures below 250degC is observed. It is shown that the nano-structures formation can be controlled by the time and the temperature of the hydrogenation},

The photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency gradually increased with increase in PCBM concentration up to 50% and decreased with further increase in PCBM concentration. Both the root mean square and average roughnesses measured by atomic force microscopy decrease as the PCBM concentration increases from 0 to approximately 70%. The surface morphology of P3HT/PCBM blended and improved donor-acceptor proximity, leading to electron conductivity, contribute to the increase in power conversion efficiency},

The ZnO films exhibited a strong (002) diffractive peak, which indicates that the ZnO crystals were highly orientated along the c-axis. The highly oriented structure of the ZnO films was confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis, which revealed vertical flower-like ZnO crystals on the substrates. Raman spectra for flower-like porous-structured ZnO film showed three feature peaks at 345 cm-1 , 570 cm-1 and 1100 cm-1, which were also found in pure bulk ZnO powder reference samples as well.

  abstract={Band alignments and microscopic structures at interfaces between CdS buffer layer grown by chemical bath deposition and Cu(In1-x Gax)Se2 (CIGS) absorbing one by three stage co-evaporation have been studied as a function of Ga substitution ratio x by means of photoemission, inverse photoemission spectroscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy and in-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). For the interfaces over the In-rich CIGS, conduction band offset (CBO) was positive, where conduction band minimum of CdS was higher than that of CIGS. The CIGS region adjacent to the interface of these specimens had band gap energy much wider than that of corresponding bulk. In in-situ XPS measurement, as-grown surfaces of the vacuum-transported In-rich CIGS showed a wide band gap feature with a surface composition around Cu:(ln+Ga):Se = 1:3.5:5.5~1:2.5:3.5, which indicates that the CIGS region adjacent to the interface should be modified in the final stage of the growth of CIGS. An increase of x resulted in a decrease of CBO. On the specimen with x = 0.40~0.45, an almost flat conduction band alignment was realized. This decreasing tendency of CBO continued even in the Ga rich region. Further rise of x resulted in an inversion of sign of CBO; for the specimens with x = 0.60 and 0.75, CBO were about -0.2 and -0.3, respectively. Around a center region of the interface of the Ga rich samples, a decrease of Fermi level, which corresponded to a rise of conduction band minimum, was locally observed together with a local rise of oxygen impurities in this region. This phenomenon also enhanced a rise of CBM of CIGS beyond that of CdS. The observed changes of the band alignments are consistent with Ga substitution ratio dependence of performances of the cells fabricated over the studied interfaces},

  abstract={Cadmium sulfide thin films have been grown using a modified chemical bath deposition method with four innovative features: i) ethylenediamine was used as the complexing agent, enabling the use of low cadmium concentrations, ii) a rectangular bath geometry with heated glass plate walls was employed, iii) a low deposition temperature (30degC) was used and iv) nitrogen gas was flowed over the substrate surface during growth. The latter two features eliminate the formation and adherence of gas bubbles on the substrate during growth, hence reducing pinhole formation. On inspection, films were found to be specularly reflective and homogeneous with no visible pinholes. Characterization was performed by atomic force microscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, optical transmittance and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It was shown that films possessed a low surface roughness value of 5.2 nm, were highly crystalline, textured, had a grain size of 15 nm and a bandgap of 2.42 eV. Preliminary results from CdTe/CdS thin film photovoltaic devices demonstrate a notable efficiency of 9.8%},

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was carried out in order to study the morphology and size distribution of the nanoparticles. It was observed that nanoparticles of lead free alloys were almost spherical in shape. The observed size distribution of both lead free solder alloy nanoparticles is between 20 ~ 80 nm. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to analyse the detailed nanostructure and oxide layer present on the nanoparticles surface. The observed oxide layer thickness is about 25Aring (2.5 nm). The depression in melting point due to nanosize effect was calculated theoretically as a function of particle size for the above mentioned lead free solder alloys and the theoretical results were compared with differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Onset calculation was used to determine the depression in melting point due to nanosize effect in respect to bulk material. The melting point difference obtained by DSC for Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu and Sn-0.4Co-0.7Cu lead free solders are between 1.1 to 7.8degC and 0.24 to 2.4degC respectively depending on the definition of the melting point determination by DSC},

  abstract={The purpose of this paper was to investigate the effect of thermal cycling on the high frequency behavior of a BGA transition structure. A broadband microwave BGA transition structure between a RF-PWB and a ceramic module was designed and fabricated. The stand-off height of the composite BGA solder joints was 500 mum. The BGA test modules mounted on the PWBs were exposed to thermal cycling testing over a temperature range of -40...+125 degC. To detect interconnection failures induced by cyclic thermal stresses, both DC resistance and scattering parameter measurements (45 MHz-25 GHz) were performed on the test assemblies at specific intervals. Parallel to the electrical measurements, crack propagation in the vicinity of the BGA transition structure was investigated using scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine the failure mechanisms of the test assemblies. Degradation in the signal transmission characteristics was first observed at higher microwave frequencies as an increase in signal return loss (|S11|). As the thermal cycling test proceeded, the reflected signal loss became more significant and gradually became pronounced at lower microwave frequencies. Pure DC resistance measurements showed no indication on the degradation of the transition structure},

  abstract={The need for faster, smaller, and more reliable and efficient products has resulted in increase of heat generated in microelectronic components. The removal of the heat generated is an important issue in electronic packaging. The present research work aims at developing a new class of nano-thermal interface material (nanoTIM) that has low thermal resistance, high thermal conductivity and mechanical strength using the electrospinning process. With the electrospinning process, polymer nano-fibers with nano-scale diameter are formed. Nano-particles such as nano-silver particles, nano-carbon nanotubes (CNT) and nano-silicon carbide particles were embedded into the nano-fibers to enhance the thermal conductivity and to reduce the thermal resistivity. Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis techniques were used to determine the morphology of the nano-composite fibers obtained. Thermal resistivity, conductivity and mechanical strength of the nano-composite materials formed were measured. In addition, the manufactured nano-materials were characterized using the thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and the differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis techniques to study the softening, melting as well as degradation behavior. The mechanical strength was also studied using a multi-functional mechanical tester. The results show that the nano-fiber based composite nano-TIMs have similar thermal conductivity, 3 to 9 times lower thermal resistivity, similar operation temperature range and degradation behavior, 2 to 5 times higher ultimate tensile strength, in comparison with commercially available TIMs. By adding adhesive functions into the process, a new class of nano-TIM tape has been produced},

  abstract={The forthcoming European legislation restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS), in effect at July 1st 2006, has prohibited the use of certain substances for electronic and or electrical equipment. One of these prohibited materials is lead, which has been used for the past decades in the solder used to connect the components to the printed circuit boards (PCBs). Therefore, lead-free solders have been developed to replace the SnPb solders. The military, medical and aerospace industries work exclusively with proven technologies and are consequently exempted from these directives. Consumer electronics already has experience with lead-free technology, although the products have a shorter lifespan, whereby the maintaining of the product is of lower importance. Industrial electronics has almost no experience with lead-free technology yet remains confronted with longevity problems. The main alternatives solder alloys are Sn, Ag and Cu (SAC) near eutectic composition. As these alloys have higher melting points and different physical characteristics in comparison to SnPb, research is needed to discover the eventual problems with the replacement of SnPb. In this work PCBs with Ni/Au finish have been soldered with SAC and SnPb alloys. Reflow and wave soldering have been performed on three type of industrial. The components soldered to the board were: ceramic resistor, ceramic capacitor, coil, diode, jumper, plastic spacer, hybride module, flexible PCB, QFP, LED, electrolytic capacitor, capacitor, oscillator, cable or connector. The component finishes encountered were: pure Sn, SnPb, SnPb40 and AgPd. Environmental and bump tests have been conducted and analyzed by means of metallurgical research. Visual and light microscopy as well as in-circuit tests have been preformed},

  abstract={Anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACAs) are widely used in microsystem packaging as interconnection materials, and many studies have been done about their electrical features, but limited works have been done on the mechanical properties with respect to the overall reliability of the packaging, and even less attention is paid to the micro-scale constituents of the internal structures in the ACA interconnection. This paper establishes a second order homogenization approach for predicting the mechanical performance of the typical internal structure in the ACA interconnection layer. This interface model is developed in the micropolar theory frame, and the macro- and micro-responses of each constituent are included. The considered structure under shear loading is simulated as application example of this model. The computational results show that the microscopic fluctuation field has a counteraction effect on the overall deformation, and the constituents with various material parameters have different responses to the prescribed loading. And the joint locations are of high possibility for crack/delamination initiation},

  abstract={New electronic packages and electronic systems with integrated micromechanical functions (MEMS) or integrated optical functions (MOEMS) need for their geometrical characterization measurement systems which can operate in the nanometer scale. At present, different optical scanning techniques are used to measure surface features of packages, substrates and other devises. Therefore a laser beam follows the object surface in a meander pattern. Because of the necessary movement of the plane-table or the sensor the measurement result is superimposed by the drive characteristics. For very smooth surfaces as silicon or glass this can result in a strong failure. In contrast to this the confocal microscopy provides a high resolution surface plot in one shot without movement of the device. This paper shows the benefits of such a measurement principle. The confocal microscope can measure optically complex surface structures while maintaining high vertical and lateral resolution. The physical filtering principle leads to a significant reduction of optical artefacts and a robust and predictable height signal in cases, where other optical methods fail. In addition the confocal microscopy allows to measure through transparent layers as passivations or optical windows in hermetic packages. For such applications a non-destructive testing becomes possible. The confocal microscopy is best used for the development of new products with functional microstructures, for the failure analysis and the industrial quality assurance. Application data demonstrate the capabilities of this technique compared to conventional scanning profilers on one side and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the other side.},

  pages={1266-1273},
  abstract={Since roughly 2002, reliability problems occur often at the ball bonds after wire bonding or reliability testing procedures. The failure mainly appears as ball lift-off or reduced pull force values. Applying focused ion beam (FIB) techniques as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) alternative failure modes in addition to Kirkendall voids were found that could be divided into five morphological categories. These failures include the missing of any Au-Al intermetallic compound (IMC) formation at the pads after wire bonding, no uniform horizontal/vertical IMC formation after wire bonding, micro cracks between the interface IMC and Au ball during reliability stressing, micro cracks between the interface of the two IMCs during temperature aging and finally corrosion of the interface IMC/Au ball during temperature aging or humidity testing. Although there is strong indication that part of these failure modes are related to front end process steps, the practical limitations resulting from separation between semiconductor manufacturing and assembly line require a back end solution. It is shown that the use of an improved high security (HS) or high reliability wire (HR) contributes significantly to reliability improvement. The wires contain special dopants which reduce the IMC and defect growth. The influence of these wires on the reliability of bonds are explained and shown in selected examples},

  abstract={In this paper, a fiber optic sensing system, designed, and developed for the detection of ammonia in aqueous ambient at room temperature, is presented. The sensor is constituted by a standard silica optical fiber (SOF) coated by a tin dioxide sensitive layer. The SnO2 films have been transferred onto the distal end of the SOF by means of the simple and low-cost electrostatic-spray-pyrolysis deposition technique. The spectral characterization of the fabricated samples has been carried out in the wavelength range 400-1750 nm in order to estimate the thickness of the SnO2 fiber coatings. The morphology and the elemental composition of the deposited layers have also been investigated by means of scanning-electron-microscopy observation and energy-dispersive-spectrometer analysis, respectively. Single-wavelength reflectance measurements have been carried out to test the sensing performances of the realized sensors toward ammonia traces in water. A fiber-Bragg-grating temperature sensor has also been used for monitoring the temperature changes occurring inside the test ambient during the experimental measurements, in order to identify the effects of thermal drifts on the sensor response. The results here presented demonstrate that the developed refractometric chemical sensor is able to provide measurements of ammonia concentration in water and at room temperature with a high sensitivity, response times of few minutes, and a resolution as low as 2 ppm},

  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major cause of blindness among the people. Many approaches are proposed by the authors to automate and detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy in fundus image. We propose a novel method of detection of the diabetic retinopathy using Gaussian intensity feature input to a VQ classifier. The underlying idea of using this technique in fundus imaging is that there are certain features which pertain only to diabetic retinopathy. These features are extracted in terms of diameter of the blood vessels expressed by sigma, and the height of the Gaussian profile across the cross-section, given by h. In this work, 30 images are taken as normal images and 25 pathological images are considered. A successful average diagnostic performance of 90% is achieved in this method},

  abstract={At present, Mammography is one of the most effective methods to detect early breast cancers. However, the signs of most micro-calcifications that are the early signs of malignant tumours cannot appear clearly in an inhomogeneous background because of the complicated structures in breast. As a rule, a tool of magnified glass is required to enlarge mammograph views to check the characteristics of a suspected lesion, but there is at least 15 percent of breast cancer that is still missed. Without specific feature, when doctors have to relay on clinical histology, this will causes a large number of misdiagnosis with false negative or false positive even decrease the rate of detection, furthermore, causing pain to the patients. Therefore, it is a crucial task to need a reliable and effective approach to assist the micro-calcifications detection. This paper uses a new technology to extract micro-calcifications clusters with accurate edge effects to obtain much more hidden information which can't be detected by the naked eye on mammograms in order to help the doctors in diagnosing early breast cancer. In this paper, this research combines the findings of histopathology in benign or malignant calcifications and uses the typical application examples with the contrastive analysis to do a relevant expatiation.},

  abstract={In 1990, Whitehill Manufacturing produced one of the earliest mooring ropes made with Spectrareg fiber for a Jones Act tanker operator. The lines were tested aboard a 60 k dwt tanker dedicated in ship-to-ship lightering service in San Francisco Bay since this vessel docked and undocked 3 to 5 times more frequently than a typical tanker. Therefore, it provided an ideal accelerated test case to evaluate the endurance of synthetic lines in a pier-side mooring application. Initial test results reflecting 8 years of service were presented at the 1998 DOT MTS conference. The breaking strength was determined to be excellent and the lines remained in service. In May 2003, these same lines were retired after 13 years of service. One of the retired lines was returned to Whitehill in its entirety. Sample sections were removed and tested to determine residual breaking strength characteristics as a function of position on the winch drum. Spectrareg fiber was removed from positions between each of the test samples and sent to Honeywell for microscopic analysis. Results on retained breaking strength are presented as well as a discussion of the mechanisms affecting the long term life of mooring lines containing fiber made from high modulus polyethylene (HMPE)},

  abstract={Automatic segmentation and tracking of biological objects from dynamic microscopy data is of great interest for quantitative biology. A successful framework for this task are active contours, curves that iteratively minimize a cost function, which contains both data-attachment terms and regularization constraints reflecting prior knowledge on the contour geometry. However the choice of these latter terms and of their weights is largely arbitrary, thus requiring time-consuming empirical parameter tuning and leading to sub-optimal results. Here, we report on a first attempt to use regularization terms based on known biophysical properties of cellular membranes. The present study is restricted to 2D images and cells with a simple to skeletal cortex underlying the membrane. We describe our new active contour model and its implementation, and show a first application to real biological images. The obtained segmentation is slightly better than standard active contours, however the main advantage lies in the self-consistent and automated determination of the weights of regularization terms. This encouraging result will lead us to extend the approach to 3D and more complex cells.},

We found that the liposomes transformed into various stable shapes depending on the combination of encapsulated proteins and experimental conditions. The vesicle morphologies observed in this model system, are similar to those of living cells.

  abstract={Nonmotile primary cilia are expressed in most renal epithelial cells. The primary cilia of renal epithelia bend with the urinary flow within the renal tubules. It has been postulated that the cilia are a mechano-sensor of urinary flow. However, the mechanical characteristics of an individual primary cilium are not fully understood. In the present study, we successfully manipulated micron-sized primary cilia of the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines derived from the collecting duct, by using optical tweezers. The primary cilia of MDCK cells, cultured on flexible plastic films, could be clearly visualized from the side by video microscopy. Optical tweezers utilize the radiation pressure from the concentrated laser beam to trap and manipulate a small microparticle, and forces on the objects in the trap can be evaluated. We showed that we could apply forces in the piconewton range to a polystyrene bead fixed on the tip of the primary cilium by using optical tweezers; by that means, the primary cilium could be bent and stretched. The elasticity of each primary cilium was analyzed by measuring the displacement of the bead},

  abstract={Filament of F-actin is formed from a linear array of G-actin and exhibits the characteristics as a negatively charged stiff polyelectrolyte with the persistence length above 1 mum. In living cellular system, F-actins from thick bundles with the help of specific proteins as the mediator. It has been found that bundling of F-actin filaments is generated with various cationic species, such as Fe3+ , spermidine3+, cationic synthetic polypeptides. It has been regarded that these multivalent cations work as a paste to stick the like-charge filaments. In the past studies, the bundling phenomenon of F-actin has frequently been observed through the increase of the light scattering. There observations indicated the cooperative, continuous nature in the transition. In the present study, we performed the observation on the bundling phenomenon by use of fluorescent microscopy. We found that the bundling transition proceeds through the coexistence of single filaments and bundles, which corresponds to the continuous nature of the transition revealed from the measurement of the light scattering. From these results, it is concluded that the bundling transition is characterized as a first-order phase transition under the criterion of Landau's symmetry argument},

  abstract={To investigate the shape-dependent cell mechanics and ECM-dependent control of motility, cell elasticity, structural features of the actin cytoskeleton (CSK) and motility responses were characterized on well-designed microprocessed substrates with micropatterned cell adhesive regions and microelastic gradient. Cell elasticity and actin CSK features of shape-engineered fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells (round and spindle-shaped) cultured on photolithographically microprocessed surfaces were characterized employing the cellular microindentation test and fluorescence observation of actin CSK by the combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM). Condition of directional cell movement towards stiffer region, so called mechanotaxis, was studied on the photolithographically-microprocessed microelastic gradient gel (MEG gel). The interrelationships between cell elasticity, the structural features of actin CSK and engineered cell shape were analyzed as compared with control cells cultured on non-processed surfaces (termed naturally extended cells). The results showed that the elasticity of regionally restricted adhesion-surface-induced shape-engineered cells, particularly highly elongated cells, is predominantly affected by cell shape rather than by the structural features of SFs. As for the mechanotaxis behaviors induced on MEG gel, design of both elasticity jump and discreteness in the elasticity boundary was found to be essential to cause cellular directional movement},

  abstract={In this paper, we review our main results on the optical and electrical properties of light-emitting silicon nanocrystals (Si-ncs) obtained from the thermally induced nucleation in amorphous silicon-rich nitride (SRN) films deposited either by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) or magnetron sputtering. In particular, we discuss the Si-ncs microscopic light emission mechanism combining the optical data with the first-principle calculations of the absorption/emission Stokes shifts and recombination lifetimes. In addition, we report on the electrical injection characteristics of simple p-i-n device structures showing efficient bipolar transport and room temperature electroluminescence, and demonstrate efficient energy sensitization of erbium (Er) ions from the Si-ncs embedded in the SRN matrices. We further show that the light-emitting nanocrystals in SRN can be embedded in aperiodic photonic environments, where the localized optical modes can be used to significantly enhance the Si-ncs emission intensity at different emission wavelengths. These results suggest that the Si-ncs embedded in the SRN matrices have a large potential for the fabrication of optically active photonic devices based on the Si technology},

  abstract={This paper presents an automatic alignment procedure for a 4-source photometric stereo technique to reconstruct the depth map in the scanning electron microscopy. PS, based on the so-called reflectance map, used several images of a surface to estimate the surface depth at each image point. Lambertian reflectivity function is the simplest one. In the SEM one of the most important signals, the backscattered electron emission, is nearly Lambertian, and, to simplify matters, SEM images are intrinsically grey scale maps. The possibility for electron-PS is assumed, taking advantage of one of the most exciting features of the technique, which doesn't return some depth illusion from ordinary pictures, but true numerical 3D models},

The InP layers were grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) on (100)-oriented single crystal InP substrates with rare-earth element (RE) addition to the growth melt. The surface morphology and defect density was monitored by optical and scanning electron microscopy, the evaluation of electrical properties was gained from C-V characteristics and Hall measurements, and the low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy was used to study the optical properties. Significant improvement of all studied layer parameters with increasing amount of RE in the melt was observed right to critical value of RE concentration. The residual impurity concentration was reduced by up to three orders of magnitude, photoluminescence spectra were markedly narrowed and fine spectral features were resolved. The conductivity changed from n- to p-type when certain limit of RE concentration in the melt was exceeded for majority of studied REs},

  abstract={Electrospinning is a straightforward and effective technique to produce nanofiber nonwovens. In this paper, a comb ionomer of poly(ethylene covinyl alcohol) end-capped with sulfonic acid (EVOH-g-SO 3H) was synthesized by two-step synthesis process and electrospun into nonwoven membranes. The effect of processing parameters on the fibrous and beads morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The result indicated that the morphology of EVOH-g-SO3H membrane was heavily dependent on the electrospinning process as the electrospinning voltage (v), the concentration of polymer solution (c), the surface tension of polymer solution (sigma), the solution flow-rate (upsi), and the deposition distance between the syringe needle and the collecting drum (1). A 'beads-on-string' morphology could be seen from SEM image when the solution was electrospun in DMAc/water while decreasing the surface tension is a good way towards the formation of fibers without beads. When the solution concentration reaches 35wt%, a melded twist-ribbon structure could appear. There is an optimum range of solution concentration (5.0~20.0wt%) for a stable electrospinning and nonwoven formation. A higher applied voltage could result in a higher electric charge density on the surface of polymer solution jet during the electrospinning, they cause the higher splitting to the polymer jet and result in higher density and smaller diameter of round beads, as well as they also produce the thinner diameters fibers},

  abstract={The paper describes an approach for preparing probes for combined SPM techniques, such as scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)/photoelectrochemical microscopy (PEM), SECM/near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). The SECM/PEM probes were constructed firstly by stripping off a single mode optical fiber's polymer coating (125 mum diameter of cladding) at one end. The stripped optical fibers were then concentrically coated with Au thin film by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The Au thin film coated optical fibers were insulating using silicon nitride thin films of low temperature plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Polishing was used to simultaneously open up the surfaces of Au ring ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) of SECM and the apertures of PEM. Once fabricated, the probes were characterized with excellent adhesion qualities at the interfaces of Au thin film/optical fiber and silicon nitride thin film/Au thin film by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement. The silicon nitride thin films were found to be free of microcracks by SEM. Electrochemical properties of the probes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) through three-electrode system. The electrochemical responses of the probes are sigmoidal in shape at different scan rates and indicate that the fabricated Au ring electrodes exhibit UMEs' electrochemical response},

  abstract={The sensitivity and stability are mainly factors to hold back the practical applications of Polypyrrole coated fabrics. In this paper, a flexible fabric strain sensor with high sensitivity, good stability and large deformation is reported. It is fabricated by depositing a nano-layer (200nm to 300nm) of polypyrrole on the fabric substrate at low temperature. Thickness and morphology of the conducting thin film on the surface of the fibers were examined by scanning probe microscopy (SPM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The measurement of the conductivity change with strain shows the fabrics so prepared exhibits a high strain sensitivity of ~160 for a deformation as large as 50%, while its good stability is indicated by a small loss of conductivity after the thermal and humidity aging tests, and supported by the slight change in conductivity and sensitivity over a storage of eighteen months. The flexible strain sensor is expected to be a promising "soft" smart material with good sensing properties in the preparation of smart garment, wearable hardware and biomedical applications},

We proved that ZnO nanostructures, including particles and nanorods, could be fabricated by a solvothermal route. Precursors of Zn(Ac)2 and LiOH reacted in ethanol at temperatures lower than 150°C. Then zinc oxide nanocrystals with a hexagonal wurtzite structure were formed. These ZnO nanocrystals were single crystalline, as confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.

Prolong reaction time, ZnO nanorods were formed and they grew along the [001] direction, whose aspect ratio was also changed with reaction time.},

Porous matrix coated on the wall of the channel in the microfluidic chip to provide a surface-enlarging matrix, is achieved by electrochemical etching technology in a hydrofluoric acid / ethanol mixture. The surface morphology of porous matrix has been characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the properties of the porous matrix have been achieved by BET (Brunauer, Emmet, and Teller) nitrogen adsorption analysis. The pore size of the porous matrix is in the range of 20 nm to 30 nm, and the surface area to volume is about 300 m2/cm3. The porous microfluidc chip is successfully used to extract DNA, obtaining about 19.2 ng genomic DNA from a microlitre rat whole blood in 35 minutes. The extracted DNA is successful used in PCR reaction to ensure that no inhibitors are present. Evaluation of the structure and the preparation process of the microfluidic chip as well as the rapid time frame for DNA extraction, the porous microfluidic chips are suitable for incorporation into muTAS (micro total analysis system).},

  year={2006},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={551-551},
  abstract={Ni-Mo based "Hastelloy" alloys are structural materials for the accelerator-driven molten-salt reactor, in which they are subjected to intense radiation damage. This causes a complete alteration of the microstructure. Since atomic collisions are responsible for inducing, modifying and activating the kinetic processes which alter the microstructure, high energy electron or proton irradiation is suitable to simulate the microstructural changes. A "Hastelloy" alloy with the nominal composition Ni-11.7Mo-6.7Cr-1.5Fe-0.8Al-0.5Ti-0.5Mg-0.5Nb-0.15Si-0.05Y (wt.%) was investigated in this study. The material was homogenized at 1100degC for 1 h and aged at 675degC for 50 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies demonstrate decoration of the grain boundaries by large Ni-Ti-Si precipitates with a high content of Y (up to 30 at.%). Local-electrode atom-probe (LEAP) tomographic analyses reveal additional small precipitates with a cylindrical morphology. The composition of these precipitates is 73.8Ni-14.8Al-3.7Ti-3.6Mo-1.7Cr (at.%) and small amounts of Mn, Fe, Si and Nb. This composition corresponds to an intermetallic phase with an A3B structure. Additionally transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses show that the precipitates have a mean diameter of 22 nm and are coherent with the fee matrix. The number density of these precipitates is about 2 times 10 21 m-3. Electron diffraction patterns from these precipitates exhibit superlattice reflections corresponding to the ordered L12 structure. For studying the microstructural changes during irradiation, the alloy was irradiated with 10 MeV electrons at 650degC for 700 h. The dose was 2 times 10-3 dpa (displacement per atom). The large precipitates at the grain boundaries remain unchanged by the electron irradiation. The small precipitates with the cylindrical morphology, however, are no longer visible. Instead, new small precipitates with an irregular morphology are observed. The number density of these new precipitates is of the same order as that of the A3B precipitates before irradiation. The L12 diffraction spots disappear completely, instead diffuse diffraction spots are observed at lang1 1/2 0rang fcc, which are attributed to short range order (SRO). An ordering transformation from L12 to lang1 1/2 0rangfcc requires a change of the atom positions. SRO with lang1 1/2 0rangfcc superstructure reflections have been found in Ni3Mo or in Ni4Mo precipitates in Ni-Mo alloys after thermal treatment. However, the content of Mo in the investigated "Hastelloy" alloy is significantly lower than that of these alloys. In both cases the ordering transformation requires changes of atom positions, which are induced by thermally activated transport or by radiation-induced diffusion, respectively. In the present case the irradiation damage may lead to the formation of metastable phases},

The clusters have diffuse boundaries, maintain the same crystal structure as the host lattice and are roughly spherical in shape. Clusters were face-centered cubic and contained up to 80 at.% Al, whereas the precipitates were diamond cubic and contained no Al. Although the existence of strain-compensated Si-Ge clusters had been postulated previously, this direct observation clarifies their role in the microstructural evolution and provide a more systematic use of this phenomenon},

  year={2006},
  volume={},

  pages={139-140},
  abstract={Successful growth of Lanthanum Monosulfide (LaS) nanodot and nanowire arrays has been performed by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using self-assembled nanoporous alumina templates containing pores about 50nm wide and 200-300 nm deep. The arrays were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Scanning Anode Field Emission Microscopy (SAFEM). The array of LaS nanodots grows selectively at boundaries between different regions of the alumina film with local hexagonal symmetry of pores. The density of these dots is about 109/cm2 (Fig.1). Cross sectional FE-SEM showed that LaS nanowires also grow inside the pores with a density of 1010/cm2, which is equal to the pore density of the templates. The field emission properties of the LaS nanodots grown on top of the alumina templates were measured using SAFEM. A typical current-voltage characteristic is shown in Fig.2. Using the conventional Fowler-Nordheim relation, the work function of the LaS nanodots has been extracted from the slope of the plot ln(J/F2) vs 1/F, where J is the field emission current density and F is the local applied field. This leads to an outstanding, reproducible effective work function value of ~1 eV for the LaS nanodots. The threshold for an emission current density of 1 mA/cm2 occurs around a 150 V/μm which is considerably lower than the 230 V/μm threshold value reported recently for LaS thin films.},

  abstract={Summary from only given. In the phase-separating Al-Ag system, intermediate metastable precipitates (Guinier Preston zones) are formed. The metastable miscibility gap is characterized by a large asymmetry with a gap extending to ~55 at.% Ag below 175degC and to ~30 at.% Ag above 220degC. The exact structure of the GP zones (ordering, Ag concentration) and the existence of temperature-dependent phases (ordered at low T and disordered at high T) is still a matter of debate and the experimental studies published on this system have yet to concur. Previous atom probe studies have confirmed the variations of GP zone concentration with temperature and a more recent work by Al-Kassab et al. showed the coexistence of two types of precipitates. Recent TEM observations have also indicated that in the initial stages of decomposition, GP zones form with a surprising morphology consisting of a Ag-rich shell surrounding an Al-rich inner core. This paper discusses our recent transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography measurements of the three-dimensional Ag concentration in precipitates, including the temporal evolution},

  abstract={Summary form only given. The enhanced interest to nanocrystalline (NC) materials is attributed to their unusual physical properties significantly different from those of usual coarse-grained counterparts. A large volume fraction of grain boundaries within NC metals and their special, non-equilibrium states play a significant role in formation of its specific properties. The specific behavior of physical properties from NC materials allows waiting the features of the electronic structure from these materials. Specific features of an electron structure of the NC tungsten and NC nickel were studied by a method of field electron emission spectroscopy. The NC structure with average grain size about 100 nm was processed in specimens of tungsten by severe plastic deformation. The microstructure was studied by ion and transmission electron microscopy. Specific features of an electron structure of the NC specimens were studied by a method of field electron emission spectroscopy. Depending on a probing area on the emitter surface (near grain boundary or far from grain boundary) the energy distribution of field-emitted electrons for NC samples either have additional maximum or have one-peak form. On the basis of the theoretical analysis it supposed that due to formation Of NC structures (by means of severe plastic shear straining under quasi-hydrostatic pressure) paths of currents with low work function at grain boundaries can occur in metal. The work function was determined by electron-beam measurements of the contact potential difference. It has been revealed that the formation of a nanocrystalline structure results in a decrease in the electron work function of a metal. For tungsten with a grain size of about 100 nm, this decrease is equal to 0.8 V},

  year={2006},

  pages={29-29},
  abstract={Summary form only given. Noble metals nanoparticles can be applied to a wide range of functions such as catalysis, optics and biosensing. Although chemical and physical synthetic routes to noble metal nanoparticles have been extensively developed, another possibility is synthesis by bioreduction of noble metal ions using microorganism. For microbial synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles, we focused on the Fe(III)-reducing bacterium Shewanella algae, which is able to transfer electrons to Fe3+ ions. Intracellular synthesis of gold nanoparticles was achieved at 25degC and pH 7 using S. algae (ATCC 51181) with H2 as the electron donor. The reductive deposition of gold by S. algae was a fast process: 1 mol/m3 AuCl4 ions were completely reduced to insoluble gold within 30 min. Speciation of gold in bacterial cultures of S. algae by X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) showed that the trivalent gold ions were rapidly reduced to gold metal in the bacterial cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of thin sections of S. algae cells revealed that the biogenic gold nanoparticles of 10-20 nm were located in the periplasm. When the pH of the HAuCl4 solution was decreased from 7 to 1, many of the biogenic gold particles were synthesized extracellularly. The gold particles synthesized at pH 1 were typically 50 nm and 500 nm, and some were angular in shape and single crystal. This suggests that at pH 1, a gold-reducing enzyme is released from the periplasmic space into the aqueous solution, and the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of gold ions in the aqueous solution. We can therefore conclude that the solution pH is an important factor in controlling the morphology of biogenic gold particles and location of particle formation},

  pages={79-79},
  abstract={Summary form only given. We report studies of ordered microporous and nanoporous polymer films formed by the evaporation of polymer solutions following exposure to a humid atmosphere. High speed microphotographic studies of the formation process reveal that near the surface of the polymer solution, vapour condensation produced near mono-disperse water droplets which form a close-packed monolayer (or 'breath figure'). An interesting feature found in the present study is the occurrence of nano-scale pores at the film surface and at (and within) the walls of the sub-surficial microscopic pores. This finding is particularly important in the context of the possible use of such films as biodegradable scaffolds for Tissue Engineering applications involving extracellular matrix production, or as candidate systems for drug delivery containment systems. Clearly, a failure to account for the presence of large populations of nanoscopic pores at (and within) the walls of the micron-scale pore structure will lead to significant overestimates of the mass of polymer available for bio degradation and hence of the likely lifetime of such structures in vivo. Similarly, given the potential application of porous scaffolds generated using the breath figure technique for slow release in drug delivery processes, the results of the present work suggest the presence of the smaller population of pores could have a significant influence on drug delivery timescale},

  abstract={Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized in atmospheric pressure microwave plasma torch in the mixture of argon, methane and hydrogen on the silicon substrate with SiO2 overlayer and a thin top iron film serving as a catalyst. This deposition technique is unique because of its simplicity and high CNT growth rate but it is still under investigation as concerns exits around its reproducibility. CNTs were deposited with the future prospect of their applications or further characterization that might require CNTs in the form of suspension or powder. One of the research directions includes measurements of CNT electrical properties such as their current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Preparation of solutions with well dispersed CNTs was studied using various liquids (distilled water, ethyl alcohol) and ultrasonication. Dried drops of these solutions were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in order to assess CNT appearance and dispersion. Electrical measurement chips with gold electrodes were prepared by electron lithography. CNTs were placed on the chips by dropping their solution and the I-V characteristics may be measured by contacting the electrodes bridged by CNTs},

Structural information of carbon nanofiber arrays obtained with high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are correlated with electrical characteristics using a semi-empirical model developed based on graphite conduction principles.

Due to the highly localized nature of dielectric breakdown, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) based tools are very suitable for monitoring the degradation and breakdown of gate dielectric.

The measurement capability of the C-AFM has been extended by connecting it with the Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The effect of current compliance on C-AFM measured post-breakdown I-V characteristics is also discussed},

Scanning electron microscopy and Raman scattering studies directly demonstrated that the different collection efficiencies of the coplanar and sandwich sensors mainly resulted from the different micro-structural features between the final growth side and the substrate side of the diamond film. The energy resolution of the diamond sensor significantly decreased with the applied electric field. A good energy resolution of 1.55 % was obtained at 66.7kV/cm for the coplanar diamond film sensor},

  abstract={Multi-focus image fusion is a process of combining two or more partially defocused images into a new image with all interested objects sharply imaged. In this paper, after reviewing the multi-focus image fusion techniques, a wavelet based fusion scheme with new image activity level measurement is presented. The proposed multi-resolution image fusion technique includes three steps: first, multi-resolution discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to obtain the wavelet coefficients of the source images. Then, applying proposed coefficients fusion scheme to the obtained coefficients, the wavelet coefficients of the fusion image are reconstructed. Finally, the final fusion image is generated by applying inversed wavelet transform. In experiments, artificial defocused images (by applying low-pass filter to the specified regions) are utilized to investigate the performance of proposed scheme and to select suitable wavelet family and wavelet decomposition scales. Then we apply the proposed image fusion scheme to optical microscopy domain to solve the short depth of focus characteristic of optical microscope. The experiments results verify the validity of the proposed multi-focus image fusion scheme.},

The type I error is defined as the difference between the mapping model used for the alignment and the actual between-image geometric distortion, and the type II error is defined as the erroneous alignment due to mismatch. Firstly, a global alignment model based on two-dimensional (2D) grid graph is proposed to eliminate error accumulation induced by type I error. Secondly, characteristic of global alignment error caused by type II error is analyzed. Finally, a minimum cycle method is proposed to eliminate the type II error. Iteratively solving the global alignment model leads to a global consistently mosaics for large-scale microscopic images},

  abstract={There is increasing commercial demand for nanoparticles because of their wide applicability in a growing number of fields, e.g. electronics, catalysis, chemistry, energy, and medicine. Metallic nanoparticles are traditionally synthesized by wet chemical techniques, where the chemicals used are quite often toxic and flammable. In this work, we describe a cost effective and environmentally sound technique for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles using live plants. We have adopted the generic term, phytosynthesis to describe this process. Nanoparticles of common heavy metal ions, e.g. Ag, Cu, Co, Zn and Ni, were synthesized by exposing plants to aqueous metal salt solutions. These experiments were used to evaluate the potential of two known hyperaccumulator species Brassica juncea, Helianthus annus and Medicago sativa for producing nanoparticles. The influence of exposure time, substrate metal ion concentration and chelating agent addition were all investigated. Brassica juncea was found to be the best plant for sequestering metals from aqueous solutions and depositing them as intracellular nanoparticles. Metal concentrations were determined by atomic absorption and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the size and shape of the nanoparticles formed.},

Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is ideally suited for such studies as it can provide information on the geometric and electronic structure of individual adsorbates on surfaces, and can also serve as an electrical contact to the molecule for conductance measurements. However, it has been reported several times that surface adsorbed organic molecules containing C=C double bonds are unstable when under the influence of the applied biases and currents of an STM tip. Here the authors use STM and density functional theory calculations to study the adsorption of acetone [(CH3)2CO] to the silicon (001) surface, and the stability of the resulting adsorbate structures.

FinFETs are three dimensional nano-scale devices consisting of a lithographically defined Si nanowire surrounded by a gate and have an active region as small as 50 60 35nm3. Analysis of the low-temperature transport properties of these devices with strong mesoscopic effects makes it possible to experimentally quantify the formation of sub-threshold inversion channels at the edges of the nanowire. By measuring the thermionic as well resonant tunneling current a channel cross-section as small as 4nm2 was found. The strong confinement of the current at the edges actually enables us to study resonant transport through single dopants present inside these channels. The charge, orbital and spin properties of the impurity states are determined and their excited states are revealed by means of transport spectroscopy.},

  abstract={The kinks formation in heterostructural nanowires was observed to be dominant when InAs nanowires were grown on GaAs nanowires. Nanowires were grown through vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism in an MOCVD (metalorganic chemical vapor deposition) reactor. GaAs nanowires were grown in [1 1 1 ]B direction on a GaAs (1 1 1 )B substrate. When InAs nanowires grown on the GaAs nanowires, most of the InAs nanowires changed their growth directions from [1 1 1 ]B to other <111>B directions. The kinks formation is ascribed to the large compressive misfit strain at the GaAs/InAs interface (7.2% lattice mismatch between GaAs and InAs) and the high mobility of indium species during MOCVD growth. The in-depth analysis of the kinks formation was done by growing InAs for short times on the GaAs nanowires and characterizing the samples. The hindrance to compressively strain InAs to form coherent layers with GaAs pushed the InAs/Au interfaces to the sides of the GaAs nanowires growth ends. New InAs/Au interfaces have generated at the sides of GaAs nanowires, due to lateral growth of InAs on GaAs nanowires. These new interfaces led the InAs nanowires growth in other <111>B directions. The morphological and structural features of these heterostructural kinked nanowires were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques.},

  abstract={The ball impact test (BIT) was developed based on the demand of a package-level measure of the board-level reliability of solder joints in the sense that it leads to brittle intermetallic fracturing, similar to that from a board-level drop test. The BIT itself stands alone as a unique and novel test methodology in characterizing strengths of solder joints under a high-speed shearing load. In this work, we present BIT results conducted on package-level 95.5Sn-4Ag-0.5Cu solder joints of a wafer-level chip-scale package, under an impact velocity of 1.4 m/s. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to investigate intermetallic morphologies and fractographs around the under bump metallurgy before and after BIT, respectively. The explicit three-dimensional finite element analysis was also conducted and the comparison between computed and measured impact force profiles were presented.},
