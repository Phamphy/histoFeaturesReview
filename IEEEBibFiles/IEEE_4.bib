  abstract={Protein subcellular locations, as an important property of proteins, are commonly learned using fluorescence microscopy. Previous work by our group has shown that automated analysis of 2D and 3D static images can recognize all major subcellular patterns in fluorescence micrographs, and that automated methods can be used to distinguish patterns that are subtly different. Since many proteins are in constant movement within the cell, we extended our studies to time series images, which contain both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we present the application of a set of temporal texture features, which do not require predefining objects for tracking, to the classification of subcellular location patterns. We demonstrate that these features successfully captured new information contained in the time domain by evaluating the accuracy of automated classification of a data set of five proteins with similar location patterns.},

  title={Analyzing motion and deformation of the cell nucleus for studying co-localizations of nuclear structures}, 
  year={2006},

  pages={1044-1047},
  abstract={In cell biology, modern imaging techniques using fluorescence microscopy allow to visualize specific nuclear structures in situ in the same cell nucleus. Hence, distances between these structures can be evaluated, in particular co-localization can be investigated. When the nucleus alters its global shape, especially if the structures are imaged sequentially, the distances are changing as well and the global movements have to be compensated. In this paper we present an image processing based quantitative evaluation system comprising: (i) semi-automatic non-rigid registration with a specific model for motion and deformation compensation, (ii) automatic detection and localization of the imaged structures, (iii) quantitative evaluation and statistical assessment of their proximity. We applied our approach to analyse the binding behaviour (indicated by co-localization) of telomeric DNA and TRF 1, a protein important for the regulation of the cellular lifespan. Our evaluation on real data shows that our motion model reproduces reliably the global movements of the nucleus and that protein and telomere co-localization could be identified by our pipeline where this was not possible before.},

  pages={1020-1023},
  abstract={This paper presents a framework for tracking fluorescent objects imaged with 3D+time video-microscopy. The proposed technique solves the NP-hard problem of the multi-frame object correspondence. For this purpose, we use the simulated annealing algorithm for its flexibility for feature correspondence and its ability to give results in a very short time. Our approach takes into account events like "split", "merge", "birth" and "death". These "evolutionary events" are motivated by biological and physical considerations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on images of carcinoma NBT-II cells expressing fluorescent LAR-PTP, a tyrosine phosphatase possibly involved in tumor progression.},

  pages={1284-1287},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a novel method for automatic registration of large set of microscopic images by automatically match high-level region features via finding cyclic structures in a matching graph. The use of high-level features (e.g., regions, landmarks, objects) significantly reduced the computation and provides accurate initialization, which further allows fast convergence of the maximum mutual information algorithm. The scheme is a universal one as it works for other types of high-level features and the matching process is very computationally efficient. We have applied our method in 3-D reconstruction of a unique human cochlear sample and are also applying it to two other set of large microscopic images.},

  title={Modeling and characterizing collagen fiber bundles}, 
  year={2006},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1280-1283},
  abstract={Collagen fibers are prominent constituents of many soft tissues. The fibers are able to carry load along their fiber axis, and, therefore, their structural arrangement renders the mechanical behavior of biological tissue anisotropic. In some tissues, e.g., blood vessels, tendons and ligaments, the fibers form fiber bundles. Structure-based biomechanical models of soft tissues strongly rely on a clear understanding of the underlying collagen fiber bundle structure and require precise quantitative structural information. The paper presents a novel fiber bundle model that satisfactorily explains the observed bundle structure and reveals meaningful parameters for bundle characterization. The model is capable of describing a wide variety of natural bundle structures. It is shown that the identified bundle parameters can be extracted from real histological images using computer vision algorithms. The generative nature of the model allows the creation of artificial fiber bundle images with characteristics very similar to real images.},

  pages={273-277},
  abstract={High-density GaN nanorods with outstanding crystal quality were grown on c-sapphire substrates by radio-frequency plasma-assisted metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy under catalyst- and template-free growth condition. Morphological and structural characterization of the GaN nanorods was employed by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). These results indicate that the rod number density can reach 1/spl times/10/sup 10/ cm/sup -2/ and the nanorods are well-aligned with preferentially oriented in the c-axis direction. Meanwhile, no metallic (Ga) droplet was observed at the end of the rods, which is the intrinsic feature of vapor-liquid-solid method. Nanorods with no traces of any extended defects, as confirmed by TEM, were obtained as well. In addition, optical investigation was carried out by temperature- and power-dependent micro-photoluminescence (/spl mu/-PL). The PL peak energies are red-shifted with increasing excitation power, which is attributed to many-body effects of free carriers under high excitation intensity. The growth mechanism is discussed on the basis of the experimental results. Catalyst-free GaN nanorods presented here might have a high potential for applications in nanoscale photonic devices.},

  abstract={A novel modulated nanolamellar structure with a lamellar spacing of about 5 nm was obtained by simple heat treatment of an initially amorphous Co/sub 65/Si/sub 15/B/sub 14/Fe/sub 4/Ni/sub 2/ magnetic alloy. The crystallographic characteristics of this nanolamellar structure were investigated using selected area diffraction pattern, Kikuchi maps, convergent beam electron diffraction, and X-ray diffraction techniques. The crystal structure of the lamellae was found to be a novel phase with a C-base centered orthorhombic crystal structure of a=0.74 nm, b=1.07 nm, and c=0.77 nm, the nanolamellar structure was modulated along the (0 0 1) plane. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations showed negligible lattice mismatch between neighboring lamellae. Electron energy loss spectroscopy mapping showed a periodic variation of boron composition corresponding to the nanolamellar periodicity. The formation of the nanolamellar structure was found to be due to spinodal decomposition within the grains formed by crystallization of the alloy.},

Polydimethylsiloxane was polymerized on flexible siliconemembranes at different levels of stiffness. The membranes werethen stretched equibiaxially using a commercially availablesystem. Image analysis was used to verify the uniformity of thestrain field applied to the cells. Microscopic analysis of stretchedand static samples showed low initial cell attachment; however, both static and stretched samples retained cells with 87% and83% viability, respectively. We are currently investigating the combined effects of substrate stiffness and stretch onvalvular interstitial cell phenotype, as the phenotype ofthese cells influences the function of heart valves [1-3].},

  pages={498-506},
  abstract={Microsystems using electrothermal bent-beam microactuators have been demonstrated for a variety of applications including optical attenuators, RF switches, and micro positioners, thus creating a need for information on the longevity of these devices. This paper reports on the dc and pulse mode lifetime testing of this class of actuators constructed using polysilicon and p/sup ++/ doped single crystal silicon. The relative temperature profile along the top surface of an actuator is experimentally verified by scanning probe microscopy. Displacement measurements are used to explore links between aging behavior and the design variables and operating conditions. At low power levels (which result in average operating temperatures of 300-400/spl deg/C) both polysilicon and p/sup ++/ Si devices provide continuous dc operation for >1400 min, in air without change in amplitude. While some types of p/sup ++/ Si devices show monotonic loss of amplitude in pulse tests, others have been operated up to 30 million cycles without degradation. The displacement for polysilicon actuators can either increase or decrease depending on the geometry of the device and operating conditions, both of which are related to temperature and stress of the structural members. Polysilicon grain transformations are observed over extended operation at high temperatures. Performance changes are correlated to material properties using SEM and TEM images.},

  pages={1174-1182},
  abstract={This paper presents a feasibility study of drilling in fresh wet bone tissue in vitro using the microwave drill method [Derby et ab, 2002], toward testing its applicability in orthopaedic surgery. The microwave drill uses a near-field focused energy (typically, power under /spl sim/200 W at 2.45-GHz frequency) in order to penetrate bone in a drilling speed of /spl sim/1 mm/s. The effect of microwave drilling on mechanical properties of whole ovine tibial and chicken femoral bones drilled in vitro was studied using three-point-bending strength and fatigue tests. Properties were compared to those of geometrically similar bones that were equivalently drilled using the currently accepted mechanical rotary drilling method. Strength of mid-shaft, elastic moduli, and cycles to failure in fatigue were statistically indistinguishable between specimen groups assigned for microwave and mechanical drilling. Carbonized margins around the microwave-drilled hole were /spl sim/15% the hole diameter. Optical and scanning electron microscopy studies showed that the microwave drill produces substantially smoother holes in cortical bone than those produced by a mechanical drill. The hot spot produced by the microwave drill has the potential for overcoming two major problems presently associated with mechanical drilling in cortical and trabecular bone during orthopaedic surgeries: formation of debris and rupture of bone vasculature during drilling.},

  pages={1939-1951},
  abstract={We present a noniterative image cross-correlation approach to track translation and rotation of crawling cells in time-lapse video microscopy sequences. The method does not rely on extracting features or moments, and therefore does not impose specific requirements on the type of microscopy used for imaging. Here we use phase-contrast images. We calculate cell rotation and translation from one image to the next in two stages. First, rotation is calculated by cross correlating the images' polar-transformed magnitude spectra (Fourier magnitudes). Rotation of the cell about any center in the original images results in translation in this representation. Then, we rotate the first image such that the cell has the same orientation in both images, and cross correlate this image with the second image to calculate translation. By calculating the rotation and translation over each interval in the movie, and thereby tracking the cell's position and orientation in each image, we can then map from the stationary reference frame in which the cell was observed to the cell's moving coordinate system. We describe our modifications enabling application to nonidentical images from video sequences of moving cells, and compare this method's performance with that of a feature extraction method and an iterative optimization method.},

  abstract={The material and electrical characteristics of /spl epsiv/-Cu3Ge as a contact metal were investigated.

The /spl epsiv/-Cu3Ge formed at 400 /spl deg/C has a resistivity of 6.8 μ/spl Omega//spl middot/cm, which is lower than typical silicides for silicon CMOS. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy showed smooth germanide/germanium interface, with a series of nanovoids aligning close to the top surface. These voids are believed to be the results of Kirkendall effect arising from the different diffusion fluxes of copper and germanium. The specific contact resistivity of Cu3Ge, obtained from four-terminal Kelvin structures, was found to be as low as 8×10/sup -8/ /spl Omega//spl middot/cm2 for p-type germanium substrate. This low resistivity makes Cu3Ge a promising candidate for future contact materials.},

  abstract={Manipulation and assembly tasks associated with micro-systems, biotechnology, and product miniaturization demand that robots increasingly operate at microscopic dimensions. This paper discusses a new microscope design, called the adaptive scanning optical microscope (ASOM), that is particularly suitable for observing robotic activities at the micron scale. The ASOM combines a custom designed scanner lens, high speed steering mirror, and MEMS deformable mirror to offer the advantages of a greatly expanded field of view, rapid image acquisition, and no agitation to the workspace or specimen. After briefly discussing the challenges of micro assembly and micro manipulation, we present the ASOM theory of operation and include simulated performance results. A low cost proof-of-concept experimental prototype of the ASOM is then described and used to demonstrate shape optimization of the MEMS deformable mirror for different field positions. Realtime tracking of multiple micromanipulators in a workspace and full area coverage are experimentally demonstrated. These results validate the ASOM concept and serve as a crucial step towards realizing a fully operational and high performance ASOM to enable the observation of micro-robotic activities over a large workspace},

  abstract={Direct frequency modulation characteristics in semiconductor lasers are described theoretically in a physics-based multidimensional framework. A microscopic formulation of a phase equation without the need of linewidth enhancement factors is derived directly from Maxwell's equations. This novel model uses a local material phase coefficient instead of the linewidth enhancement factor. Hence, the impact of local phase changes on the optical mode can be described via a spatial integration in analogy to mode gain. The model is applied to the modulation-induced fine structure of the laser power spectrum. It is found that the asymmetry in the modulation-induced fine structure observed in measurements can be explained by the proposed model taking temperature, carrier, and photon effects on the material phase coefficient into account. Furthermore, the implementation of the photon phase into a multidimensional device simulator is described.},

  abstract={Recent innovations in drug therapies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have made it highly desirable to obtain sensitive biomarkers of disease progression that can be used to quantify the performance of candidate disease modifying drugs. We present a spatio-temporal analysis technique to automatically quantify small changes in a bone in in-vivo serial MR images from an experimental model of RA. The technique integrates the time-domain information across all the time points by building a 5-dimensional feature space (3 spatial dimensions, 1 intensity dimension, and 1 temporal dimension) from the serial MR images after rigid image registration. The feature space is then delineated by the mean shift algorithm to give high-intensity bone lesions as 4D segmentations. We detected significant temporal changes in bone lesion volume in 5 out of 7 identified candidate bone lesion regions, and significant difference in bone lesion volume between male and female subjects in 1 out of 7 candidate bone lesion regions. We quantitatively compared this technique with a previous method using simulated and real MR images, and histology of the subjects. We found that this technique was more sensitive to small bone lesion changes than a previous method.},

  abstract={We report a wafer-to-wafer bonding technique with solder as the bonding layer but without the use of any flux. This fluxless or flux-free feature makes void-free and uniform bonding layer possible. If flux were used as in the case of typical soldering processes, the flux or flux residues could be easily trapped in the joint, resulting in voids and uneven solder layer. Flux residues, if not completely removed, could also cause potential reliability problem. The bonding process is performed in a developed vacuum chamber to inhibit solder oxidation. To prevent oxidation during solder manufacturing, 20mum of Sn is electroplated over the entire 2-inch silicon wafer, followed immediately by a thin capping layer of Ag. This outer Ag layer prevents the inner tin from oxidation when the wafer is removed from the plating bath and exposed to air. To evaluate the joint quality and study the microstructure and composition, scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are used. The success of this development shows that it is indeed possible to bond entire wafers together with a thin metallic joint of high quality. This fluxless bonding technique can be extended to bonding wafers of different materials for new device and packaging applications},

  year={2006},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={6 pp.-},
  abstract={Conductive filler-polymer composite materials have been extensively investigated as conductor-insulator percolative system to achieve high dielectric constant (K). Additionally, the effective dielectric constant of conductive filler/polymer composite can be dramatically enhanced by increasing the dielectric constant of polymer matrix according to scaling theory. However, the high dielectric loss of this type material at high filler loading levels has been a challenging issue, which is originated from the high conductivity and excessive polarized interface induced by the fillers. In this study, an in-situ formed metal nanoparticles/polymer resin compound was developed as a high K polymer matrix by adopting a relatively low concentration of conductive filler to obtain high K retaining low dielectric loss simultaneously. Nano-sized metal particles are preferred because they achieve thinner dielectric films leading to a higher capacitance density. Compared to an ex-situ blending technique by incorporating and dispersing pre-synthesized nanoparticles into polymers, the in-situ synthesis method can offer more advantages such as much more uniform dispersion in polymers and easy size control of nanoparticles. This study explores the in-situ nanoparticle synthesis method by photochemical conduction of a metallic precursor within the polymer matrix. Crystal structure analysis and morphology characterization of the as-prepared nanocomposites by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated the success of the in-situ formation of silver (Ag) nanoparticles in various polymer matrices by the photochemical method. Uniform dispersion of nano Ag particles with size of less than 10 nm in polymer matrices was observed. The effects of reducing agent types, concentrations of a metal precursor, epoxy matrix types and additives on the morphology of nanoparticles will be discussed. Based on the results of UV-Vis and FT-IR study, the proposed reaction mechanism of reduction of silver ion to silver will be presented. Aluminum particles were incorporated into the in-situ formed nano Ag/epoxy composite and the dielectric properties of the composite materials were also investigated. The composites showed a more than 50% increase in K values compared with an Al/neat epoxy composite with the same filler loading of Al. Moreover, the dielectric loss was maintained below 0.05. The results suggested that the in-situ formed Ag-polymer nanocomposites via photochemical approach can be employed as a high-K polymer matrix to host various fillers such as conductive metal or high dielectric constant ceramic fillers. The dielectric behavior of the composites materials at various frequency, their morphology, physical properties and their correlations will be discussed.},

In this paper we report upon the development of a prototype of a secure distributed infrastructure that links imaging data from pathology and radiology. The intention is that a fully-developed system will be capable of supporting studies that will examine whether prognostic and diagnostic features which are apparent in histopathological sections and clinical scans are related. Further, these studies will consider whether these features can be meaningfully linked into a diagnostic or predictive profile. The project in which the prototype is being developed naturally involves a large degree of cooperation across various disciplines.

  abstract={This paper discusses on the effect of number of zincation in electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) under bump metallurgy (UBM) on reliability in microelectronics packaging. Double and triple zincation of ENIG methods were used as comparison study. The effect of number of zincation to surface roughness and surface morphology were investigated. All samples were subjected to reliability tests such as multiple reflow, high temperature storage life (HTSL) and temperature/thermal cycle (TC) according to joint electron device engineering council (JEDEC) conditions. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used as analytical tools in this study. In multiple reflow tests, no reliability failure found for triple zincation, however for double zincation of ENIG UBM, the failure revealed failure after 3 times of reflow cycle. Thermal fatigue failure for both double and triple zincation of ENIG UBM revealed after 100 hours and 200 hours of HTSL, respectively. For TC test, thermal fatigue failure occurred after 150 cycles, for both double and triple zincation of ENIG UBM. The external and internal crack observed for this failure. The crack growth for double zincation is always much bigger than the triple zincation of ENIG UBM for both HTSL and TC tests. As conclusion, triple zincation gives a better surface morphology of electroless nickel. Hence, it can achieve a reliable solder joint leads to better adhesion between UBM and solder ball therefore, it can achieve a reliable solder joint},

  abstract={The nanotechnology with chemical deposition (CD) and rapid photothermal processing (RPP) of nanostructured ZnO thin films for solar cell applications was elaborated. The influence of growth processes and the impact of RPP on surface morphology, particles size and resistivity values are presented and discussed. The ZnO thin films were deposited on silicon substrates by chemical deposition method at room temperature and normal pressure. The obtained thin films were rapid photothermal processed in vacuum and N2 ambient. Nanostructures of the deposited films were optimized by adjusting various growth parameters: concentration of zinc complex solution, temperature of aqueous solution of anions and RPP regimes. Structural and electrical properties were investigated by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrical resistivity measurements. Electrical resistivity measurements showed that the room temperature resistivity of 105 Omega-cm for as-deposited ZnO, decreased to 103 Omega-cm after rapid photothermal processing. The impact of RPP temperatures was found to have an important role in the formation of ZnO nanostructures properties for solar cells applications and photoluminescence enhancement. The highest intensity of photoluminescence was obtained at 650degC RPP temperature. The experimental results shown that by RPP is possible to control the surface morphology, electrical properties and photoluminescence of nanostructured zinc oxide thin films as active component and antireflection coating of the solar cells},

  abstract={Studies of drug effects on cancer cells are performed through measuring cell cycle progression such as inter phase, prophase, metaphase and anaphase in individual cells. Such studies require the processing and analysis of huge amounts of image data. Manual image analysis is very time consuming thus costly, potentially inaccurate and poorly reproducible. Stages of an automated cellular imaging analysis consist of segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and tracking of individual cells in a dynamic cellular population. Image classification of cell phases in a fully automatic manner presents the most difficult task of such analysis. We considered applying several versions of Gaussian mixture and Markov models for automating the classification of cell nuclei in different mitotic phases recorded over a period of twenty-four hours at every fifteen minutes with a time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The experimental results have shown that the proposed methods are effective and have potential for higher performance},

  abstract={A novel four-dimensional, patient-specific Monte Carlo simulation model of solid tumor response to chemotherapeutic treatment in vivo is presented. The special case of glioblastoma multiforme treated by temozolomide is addressed as a simulation paradigm. Nevertheless, a considerable number of the involved algorithms are generally applicable. The model is based on the patient's imaging, histopathologic and genetic data. For a given drug administration schedule lying within acceptable toxicity boundaries, the concentration of the prodrug and its metabolites within the tumor is calculated as a function of time based on the drug pharamacokinetics. A discretization mesh is superimposed upon the anatomical region of interest and within each geometrical cell of the mesh the most prominent biological "laws" (cell cycling, necrosis, apoptosis, mechanical restrictions, etc.) are applied. The biological cell fates are predicted based on the drug pharmacodynamics. The outcome of the simulation is a prediction of the spatiotemporal activity of the entire tumor and is virtual reality visualized. A good qualitative agreement of the model's predictions with clinical experience supports the applicability of the approach. The proposed model primarily aims at providing a platform for performing patient individualized in silico experiments as a means of chemotherapeutic treatment optimization},

  abstract={The electrothermal simulator developed in this work uses an iterative procedure that self-consistently couples a Monte Carlo electronic trajectory simulation with a fast Fourier series solution of the heat diffusion equation. Results presented in this paper are obtained from the simulation of In0.15Ga0.85As/Al 0.28Ga0.72As HEMTs. The negative differential output conductance (thermal droop) is observed in the electrothermal I ds-Vds characteristics of the simulated devices. Temperature profiles across the simulated region corresponding to different heat generation distributions are shown to be nonuniform with peak temperature and temperature range values dependent upon the device bias. The microscopic details of charge transport are studied, and the relationship between the thermal droop and the microscopic velocity properties is analyzed. The reduction in the length of the semiconductor die is shown to affect the peak temperature values without significantly altering the temperature range. The distribution of heat generation across the devices is simulated using a microscopic level count of phonon emission and absorption events and compared with that obtained using the current density-electric field (JmiddotE) dot product. The J middot E calculation was found to overestimate the local heat generation in the most electrically active regions of the device},

  pages={1052-1067},
  abstract={We present a method for the analysis of basal ganglia (including the thalamus) for accurate detection of human spongiform encephalopathy in multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. One common feature of most forms of prion protein diseases is the appearance of hyperintensities in the deep grey matter area of the brain in T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. We employ T1, T2, and Flair-T2 MR sequences for the detection of intensity deviations in the internal nuclei. First, the MR data are registered to a probabilistic atlas and normalized in intensity. Then smoothing is applied with edge enhancement. The segmentation of hyperintensities is performed using a model of the human visual system. For more accurate results, a priori anatomical data from a segmented atlas are employed to refine the registration and remove false positives. The results are robust over the patient data and in accordance with the clinical ground truth. Our method further allows the quantification of intensity distributions in basal ganglia. The caudate nuclei are highlighted as main areas of diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD), in agreement with the histological data. The algorithm permitted the classification of the intensities of abnormal signals in sCJD patient FLAIR images with a higher hypersignal in caudate nuclei (10/10) and putamen (6/10) than in thalami. Defining normalized MRI measures of the intensity relations between the internal grey nuclei of patients, we robustly differentiate sCJD and variant CJD (vCJD) patients, in an attempt to create an automatic classification tool of human spongiform encephalopathies},

  abstract={We propose an adaptive multiresolution (MR) approach for classification of fluorescence microscopy images of subcellular protein locations, providing biologically relevant information. These images have highly localized features both in space and frequency which naturally leads us to MR tools. Moreover, as the goal of the classification system is to distinguish between various protein classes, we aim for features adapted to individual proteins. These two requirements further lead us to adaptive MR tools. We start with a simple classification system consisting of Haralick texture feature computation followed by a maximum-likelihood classifier, and demonstrate that, by adding an MR block in front, we are able to raise the average classification accuracy by roughly 10%. We conclude that selecting features in MR subspaces allows us to custom-build discriminative feature sets for fluorescence microscopy images of protein subcellular location images.},

  abstract={In this paper, we use a circular distribution to quantify certain domain properties and model the hysteresis behavior of piezoceramic materials. The model is constructed by bridging the characteristics of microscopic domain distribution into the macroscopic (or bulk) behavior. Contributions, other than those associated with the polarization of domains, to bulk quantities are also counted. A domain orientation distribution function is first selected and the corresponding distribution function parameters are chosen as the internal state variables. For the two-dimensional model, a von Mises-Fisher circular distribution is used. Instead of micromechanical analysis of domain motions that would involve large computation efforts, the delineation of domain evolution is simplified by considering the evolution of the domain orientation distribution, which is determined by the dynamic variations of the internal state variables. We also develop a procedure to identify the material constants introduced in the constitutive equations. The models are used to quantitatively characterize various hysteresis loops observed in piezoceramic materials.},

The contact resistance is measured between silver with different coating materials, and the relationship of tunnel resistivity-contact pressure is obtained based on the experimental results. 3-D microstructure models and resistor networks are built to simulate the electrical conduction in conductive adhesives. The total resistance of the resistor network is calculated based on the measured tunnel resistivity, measured epoxy shrinkage, and contact pressure calculated from finite element analysis. The effects of geometric properties of filler particles, such as size, shape and distribution, on the conductive property are studied by method of factorial design. Lap shear tests are performed on conductive adhesives under harsh conditions, including thermal cycling, high temperature and humidity aging, corrosion, vibration and impact. Mechanical stress/strain and electrical conduction of conductive adhesives are monitored during these tests. Microscopy is used to study the failure mechanism. The relationship between mechanical failure and electrical failure is investigated. Mechanical and electrical reliability of both the bulk conductive adhesive and interface between conductive adhesive and components are studied. Life prediction models of conductive adhesives will be built based on the experimental measurements},

The effects of reducing agent type, concentration of metal precursor, epoxy matrix type and additives on the morphology of nanoparticles were explored. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the microstructure of the in-situ formed Ag nanoparticles within the epoxy matrix, called as Ag-epoxy mixture which can be used as a high-K polymer matrix. The dielectric properties of the Al/Ag-epoxy composites were studied and compared with the Al/epoxy composites.},

  abstract={Atmospheric microwave plasma jets generated in Ar gas or$hboxAr/O_2$and$hboxAr/H_2$gas mixtures were applied to a surface modification of metal. The nozzle-type microwave plasma jet is excited in a rectangular waveguide, operated at a frequency of 2.45 GHz, and is stabilized by the flowing channel of a working gas through the nozzle. The charged particles, with a high kinetic energy produced from the plasma jet, caused a surface in a rough morphology to be smooth, showing a change in the water contact angle. A scanning electron microscopy and a water contact-angle analyzer characterized the samples treated in different gas mixtures. The water contact angles of the samples were plotted as a function of the recovery time, showing that the sample treated by$hboxAr/H_2$plasma jet has the smallest contact angle$(sim 3^circ)$and the slowest recovery of the angle. In the estimation of the aluminum-surface free energy, after the$hboxH_2hbox/hboxAr$plasma treatment, the total surface free energy of the Al sample increased from 18.71 to 82.81$hboxmJ/m^2$drastically.},

  abstract={Double-gate devices with ultra-thin body are considered the most promising for scaling into the sub-20nm regime because of their steeper sub-threshold slope, reduced short channel effects, improved mobility, and drive current. The FinFET device structure is an attractive double-gate structure and most compatible with today's standard processing technologies. One of the challenging issues of fabricating FinFETs device is how to form the FinFET's source-drain junction in the Fin area and develop metrology techniques to measure it. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of implanting ultra-thin fins and metrology development for measuring Fin doping concentration. Our simulation results demonstrate that a high angle of implantation at a certain energy is needed to maximize the dopant distribution in the Fin. Raman microscopy has been developed as a Fin doping measurement metrology. To ease the junction diffusion under the gate and reduce off current dispersion, a gate-source/drain underlap FinFET structure is investigated to make FinFET junction formation more manufacturable. Our simulation data yields optimal characteristics and shows robustness to process variation.},

  volume={53},

  pages={2320-2327},
  abstract={Polysilicon memory switching is demonstrated in vertical n-i-p diodes with TiN contacts and with feature sizes of 150 nm. An increase of more than three orders of magnitude of the forward current at +2 V is achieved after the application of a +8 V programming pulse. A physical change in the polysilicon is confirmed by different wet-etch rates of unprogrammed and programmed diodes. By comparing the ideality factors of the TiN-contacted diodes before and after programming, it is shown that the programming pulse increases the degree of order in the polysilicon. The mechanism by which the programming pulse increases order is electrothermal heating of the Si. When the metal contact to the polysilicon is changed from TiN to TiSi2, memory switching is eliminated. The TiSi2 contact seeds the crystallization of more ordered polysilicon during device fabrication compared to crystallization with TiN contacts, as shown by transmission electron microscopy},

The emission wavelengths demonstrated range from ultraviolet (UV) (370 nm) to blue (470 nm) and green (520 nm). The devices show good uniformity and performance due to finger-pattern n-electrodes running between adjacent stripes. In the case of the UV devices for example, turn-on voltages are around 3.5 V and continuous-wave output powers per stripe ~80 muW at 20 mA. A major feature of these devices is their ability to generate pattern-programmable emission, which offers applications in areas including structured illumination wide-field sectioning optical microscopy},

  year={2006},

  number={},
  pages={29-33},
  abstract={The efficient detection and quantification of rolling leukocytes within intravital microscopy is of both theoretical and practical interest. Currently, methods exist for tracking rolling leukocytes in vivo which rely on manual detection of the cells. In this paper, a new technique inspired by the teardrop shape of the rolling leukocytes is presented for accurately detecting rolling leukocytes. It is based on a feature score, the gradient inverse coefficient of variation (GICOV), which serves to discriminate rolling leukocytes from a cluttered environment. The leukocyte detection process consists of three sequential steps: The first step utilizes a novel teardrop shape matching algorithm to coarsely identify the leukocytes by finding the leukocytes resembling teardrops with a locally maximal GICOV. Second and third steps involve evolution of B-spline snake starting from each of the teardrops found in the first step to refine the leukocytes boundaries and associated GICOV score, and retaining contours with high GICOV scores. The detection process is observed to yield superior results compared to other methods currently in use. The deformation information inherent in the teardrop shapes gives valuable information about the extent to which the cells are adhering to the endothelium.},

Since a common claim about the wavelet transform is that it splits images into an approximation and details, which contain edges, we use it in our experiments. This paper studies the edge detecting characteristics of the 2D discrete wavelet transform, and compares it to other common edge-detection methods for filopodia detection.},

  abstract={Inspecting what sort of starch in commercial starchnoodles is important to international trade, food safety and protecting consumer benefit. At present, the inspection of components of starches in starch-noodle mainly relies on sensory perception, and which is fallibility or trustless. Because the microstructure pattern of starches in starchnoodles depends mainly on a kind or blend of starches from which the starch-noodle was made, this paper presents an approach to classify the starch-noodles by using computer system automatically based on recognizing the microstructure pattern of the starches and components in starch-noodle. The method consists of three step: 1) take the micrograph of starch-noodles with scanning electron microscopy and preprocessing. 2) extract features of fractal geometry and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence from micrograph. 3) distinguish a sort of starch-noodles by using these combined features as input vector of artificial neural networks. The experiments has been conducted with starch-noodles of mungbean blending pachyrhizus, and the experimental results show that the method is practicable and effective.},

Significant elimination of GeOxN y interfacial layer is observed from cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images after 600 degC postmetallization anneal, suggesting that an interface passivation technique having better thermal stability is required in order to suppress the severe interdiffusion across the interface between Ge substrate and the upper dielectric layer},

The variance is Poissonian for small charge packets. The noise values presented in this paper may serve as a target when optimizing charge-injection operation of a CCD},

Virgin states of circular and rectangular elements showed a variety of patterns including centered and off-centered vortices. At remanence, rectangles with rounded edges revealed multiple domains separated by a domain wall running transverse to the longer axis. The magnetization reversal behavior of rectangles with regular edges involved S-shaped and bidomain states, whereas the reversal mechanism for rectangles with rounded edges involved "Y" and "V" shaped domain walls separating the magnetic domains. Reproducible switching was observed when these latter shapes were subjected to repeated field cycles},

  abstract={The magnetic field (MF) annealing of dc electrodeposited ferromagnetic nanowire arrays of compositions Co94Fe06 , Co91Fe07B2 was done in the direction of their easy axis of magnetization (in plane) at 2650 C under 800 Oe applied magnetic field for 2 h. An induced magnetic anisotropy (MA) and a large increase in saturation magnetization (Ms) were manifested by the changes in hysteresis loops of the nanowire samples before and after the annealing process. The structural changes were investigated using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The shape of nanowires, the predicted natural texture with c-axis in the plane of membrane (because of high concentration of cobalt) and diffusional pair ordering of unlike atoms along the direction of external applied field were thought to be the causes of induced MA. The reannealing of samples in absence of MF at 400degC and 600degC produced no significant changes in hysteresis loops instead of removing the MA but with evolution of crystalline phase in both the samples. Therefore, the shape of nanowire was concluded to play the major role in persistence of induced MA in nanowire samples after high temperature annealing},

  abstract={We have observed the magnetic domain evolution under an external magnetic field in an epitaxial MnAs film on GaAs(001) by magnetic force microscopy. Owing to the strain involved, the ferromagnetic alpha-MnAs and the paramagnetic beta-MnAs phases coexist as self-aligned stripes at room temperature. It was found that a complex magnetic domain structure appeared in the ferromagnetic alpha-phase region at the demagnetized state (H=0 Oe). As the magnetic field increased, the magnetic domain structure was gradually changed, and reached a completely saturated state at H=600 Oe. Especially, at H=300 Oe, the observed magnetic domain wall distribution is well matched with the topographical shape.},

  abstract={A laser-based bonding technique, called transmission laser bonding (TLB), is studied for the purposes of device and wafer-level packaging. The TLB technique uses the specific characteristics of a laser to bond a transparent wafer on top of an opaque wafer. When a laser beam with a specific wavelength is passed through a transparent wafer, high-density laser energy is absorbed by the opaque wafer and melts a thin surface layer, resulting in the formation of strong chemical bonds across the two wafers. A Nd:YAG pulse laser has been used to bond a transparent glass wafer to a Si substrate. The associated bond strengths under various bonding conditions are examined by a microtensile tester to quantify the bonding quality. With a contact pressure higher than 0.5 MPa, the TLB strength can reach a stable value of 10.5 MPa, which is comparable to those obtained by other popular bonding processes currently used by the packaging industry. The wafer surface conditions are evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and profilometry, while Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to study the characteristics of bonding interfaces. The AFM and profilometry results reveal that the wafer roughness and flatness required by TLB can be less stringent than those specified in the current industrial standards. The AES and XPS results are used to interpret the chemical and physical aspects of TLB formation and to provide the rationale for obtaining high-quality and high-strength TLB},

  abstract={The paper presents a mesoscopic traffic simulation model, particularly suited for the development of integrated meso-micro traffic simulation models. The model combines a number of the recent advances in simulation modeling, such as discrete-event time resolution and combined queue-server and speed-density modeling, with a number of new features such as the ability to integrate with microscopic models to create hybrid traffic simulation. The ability to integrate with microscopic models extends the area of use to include evaluation of ITS systems, which often require the detailed modeling of vehicles in areas of interest, combined with a more general modeling of large surrounding areas to capture network effects of local phenomena. The paper discusses the structure of the model, presents a framework for integration with micro models, and illustrates its validity through a case study with a congested network north of Stockholm. It also compares its performance with a hybrid model applied to the same network},

  abstract={This paper presents findings from a comparative evaluation of two Australian power-based models of fuel consumption and environmental emissions using traffic simulation. The simulation approach provides a number of advantages for this type of work through detailed modelling of road geometry and grade, driver behaviour, vehicle performance and traffic parameters. The power-based models were interfaced to a microscopic traffic simulator and applied to each vehicle on the road network. Second-by-second fuel consumption and pollutant emissions were estimated on a section-by-section and network-wide basis. The simulation study examined a number of abstract vehicle types and gathered detailed information about their speed profiles, acceleration, deceleration, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. The results showed that the fuel consumption outputs were similar but the emission estimates were substantially different for the two models. The paper also compared the outputs of the two models against various standard tests. The results showed that both models provided higher rates of pollutant emissions when compared with available standard test data. The paper concludes with some recommendations for further research to enhance the performance of the models},

  title={System-Wide Impacts of Green Extension Transit Signal Priority}, 
  year={2006},

  abstract={Basic green extension transit signal priority (TSP) was implemented on U.S. Route 1 in the Northern Virginia Area. The study investigated the system-wide benefits of green extension TSP operation on the U.S. Route 1 corridor using the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic simulation software. The simulation results indicated that transit signal priority did not result in statistically significant changes in transit vehicle, auto, or system-wide travel times (differences less than 1%). Furthermore, a paired t-test concluded that basic green-extension TSP did not increase side-street queue lengths. The simulation results indicated that the transit priority system generally benefited transit vehicles but did not guarantee system-wide benefits. Maximum travel-time savings in the order of 3.40% were observed with the provision of green extension TSP. These findings are a result of the unique characteristics of the study corridor and the TSP logic implemented. Specifically, the study corridor operated under a long cycle length of 180 seconds with most of the green time assigned to U.S Route 1 (on average 76 percent). Thus the probability of receiving a green extension was relatively small (less than 3% per intersection for each transit vehicle). Furthermore, even when a TSP-equipped vehicle arrived during a red indication, the stopped delay was relatively short because most of the cycle time was assigned to U.S. Route 1},

  pages={408-408},
  abstract={Summary form only given. In this paper, we present the characteristics of linear arrays of microplasma devices having cylindrical cavities 127 mum or 180 mum in diameter and in the rare gases at pressures of 400 to 800 torr. Each device is comprised of 6 rows of 72 via holes each formed in a multilayer stack of low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC). The arrays are driven by two coplanar or two crossed electrodes buried in the LTCC. The separation between the electrodes is 220 mum in the coplanar electrode structure and 200 mum in the crossed electrode structure and driven at ~20 kHz by either a sinusoidal AC or pulsed DC waveform. The arrays show very stable operation and all microplasmas ignite simultaneously. Cavity-to-cavity uniformity in a single row is better than 10%. Optical and electrical measurements of these devices operating with 400 to 800 torr in Ne and Xe/Ne mixtures reveal several interesting phenomena. The curvature of the microcavity walls, combined with the location of the electrodes, allows for the electric field within the microcavity to be shaped, and the results of optical microscopy studies of the spatially-resolved emission from the microplasmas will be presented. Also, the electrical characteristics and several potential applications of this new microcavity design will be discussed},

  pages={73-73},
  abstract={Summary form only given. This research investigates the feasibility of synthesizing thin films of hafnium oxide via ablation plasma ion implantation (APII). HfO2 is of great interest as a high-dielectric-constant material in the semiconductor fabrication industry and may also have applications to high power microwave windows or cathodes. Experiments are underway at UM to deposit and implant films of hafnium and hafnium-oxide on silicon substrates. A KrF laser (400 mJ @ 248 nm) ablates solid Hf foils or sintered pellets of hafnium-oxide. Silicon substrates can be biased (- or + , either pulsed or DC) by voltages up to 10 kV for ion implantation and deposition. The experiments will study correlations among parameters such as laser energy, film thickness, background gas pressure, film composition, and ion energy. Ablation plasma plumes are characterized by optical emission spectroscopy. Composition and morphology of deposited films are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Thin film adhesion is also being tested. X-ray diffraction is being used to determine if the Hf films are amorphous or crystalline. Deposition rates are estimated to be on the order of 0.055 nm/pulse at a laser repetition rate of 20 pulses},

  title={Macroscopic emission non-uniformity in thermionic cathodes due to profilimetry variation}, 
  year={2006},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={108-108},
  abstract={Summary form only given. Micron-scale ridges, introduced by the surface machining of thermionic dispenser cathodes, may lead to significant angular variations in the macroscopic current density on ring-shaped cathodes commonly used in gyrotrons or flat cathodes used in traveling wave tubes. Most gyrotrons utilize thermionic dispenser cathodes operating in the temperature limited regime. Non-uniform emission in gyrotrons leads to mode competition, mode hopping, efficiency degradation, and severe local heating in the collector region. Insofar as emission non-uniformity can be related to small-scale differences in surface geometry, a theoretical analysis of the angular dependence of field enhancement variation induced by machining processes is topical to electron source technologies that are not operated in the space charge limited regime. Recent studies of ring-shaped gyrotron cathodes show large scale angular variation in emission current from quadrant to quadrant, with adjacent quadrants differing by as much as a factor of two. Thermionic dispenser cathodes are generally machined to make their emission area smooth, but the machining process introduces parallel micron-scale ridges along the surface. Conical cathodes are, moreover, rotated about an axis as they are machined: if asymmetries are introduced by a slight wobble about the axis of symmetry plus a small ellipsoidal characteristic of the cathode cross-section, then the first three terms of a Fourier transform of the emission as a function of angle may be inferred to account for most of the variation that experimentally observed. It is unlikely that large scale quadrant variations can be caused by the random, microscopic variations in the low work function coatings or field enhancement factors due to protrusions on the cathode surface, or by variations in the heating coil used to elevate the cathode temperature},

  abstract={Human faces manifest distinct structures and characteristics when observed in different scales. Traditional face recognition techniques mainly rely on low-resolution face images, leading to the lost of significant information contained in the microscopic traits. In this paper, we introduce a multilayer framework for high resolution face recognition exploiting features in multiple scales. Each face image is factorized into four layers: global appearance, facial organs, skins, and irregular details. We employ Multilevel PCA followed by Regularized LDA to model global appearance and facial organs. However, the description of skin texture and irregular details, for which conventional vector representation are not suitable, brings forth the need of developing novel representations. To address the issue, Discriminative Multiscale Texton Features and SIFT-Activated Pictorial Structure are proposed to describe skin and subtle details respectively. To effectively combine the information conveyed by all layers, we further design an metric fusion algorithm adaptively placing emphasis onto the highly confident layers. Through systematic experiments, we identify different roles played by the layers and convincingly show that by utilizing their complementarities, our framework achieves remarkable performance improvement.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing the density of a scene from multiple projection images produced by modalities such as x-ray, electron microscopy, etc. where an image value is related to the integral of the scene density along a 3D line segment between a radiation source and a point on the image plane. While computed tomography (CT) addresses this problem when the absolute orientation of the image plane and radiation source directions are known, this paper addresses the problem when the orientations are unknown - it is akin to the structure-from-motion (SFM) problem when the extrinsic camera parameters are unknown. We study the problem within the context of reconstructing the density of protein macro-molecules in Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM), where images are very noisy and existing techniques use several thousands of images. In a non-degenerate configuration, the viewing planes corresponding to two projections, intersect in a line in 3D. Using the geometry of the imaging setup, it is possible to determine the projections of this 3D line on the two image planes. In turn, the problem can be formulated as a type of orthographic structure from motion from line correspondences where the line correspondences between two views are unreliable due to image noise. We formulate the task as the problem of denoising a correspondence matrix and present a Bayesian solution to it. Subsequently, the absolute orientation of each projection is determined followed by density reconstruction. We show results on cryo-EM images of proteins and compare our results to that of Electron Micrograph Analysis (EMAN) - a widely used reconstruction tool in cryo-EM.},

  abstract={In many image analysis systems, segmentation is the first step. So its accuracy impacts on whole system efficiency. In normal human blood microscopic image, which contains white and red blood cells, because of high accumulation of red cells, there exist touch and overlap between these cells. They are two difficult issues in image segmentation which common segmentation algorithms cannot overcome them. Red cell has fine texture while white cell has coarse one, so texture is a very good discriminating feature for segmentation of blood cells. Gabor filters are one of the most powerful methods for texture segmentation. Blood image don't have regular textures. Common Gabor filter banks are suitable for regular texture segmentation. So we have employed a Gabor filter bank including many orientations and few frequencies in combination with sigmoid function for blood image segmentation. Results show that our approach is efficient},

  abstract={Time series produced in complex systems are always controlled by multi-level laws, including macroscopic and microscopic laws. These multi-level laws bring on the combination of long-memory effects and short-term irregular fluctuations in the same series. Traditional analysis and forecasting methods do not distinguish these multi-level influences and always make a single model for prediction, which has to introduce a lot of parameters to describe the characteristics of complex systems and results in the loss of efficiency or accuracy. This paper goes deep into the structure of series data, decomposes time series into several simpler ones with different smoothness, and then samples them with multi-scale sizes. After that, each time series is modeled and predicated respectively, and their results are integrated finally. The experimental results on the stock forecasting show that the method is effective and satisfying, even for the time series with large fluctuations},

  abstract={Due to the limitation of the microscopic focal length, the obtained microscopic images are often blurred in some local areas, which causes that people can not recognize or understand it completely. Based on the different energy distributions of the low-frequency band and the high-frequency band, which are achieved by discrete wavelets transform, an original method for wavelet coefficient combination is proposed in this paper. It takes the ratio of the two bands as a characteristic value and the maximum value is chosen as an integration rule for determining new wavelet coefficients. This method can remove the defocused areas and reduce the distortion of the fused images. Finally, the advantage of the proposed fusion approach is demonstrated clearly by practical experiments, by comparison with conventional area based pixel selection method. From the microscopy full-focus image, researchers can measure the desired results directly},

  abstract={A series of ferroelectric switching measurements are performed on the 75/25mol% vinylidene fluoride/trifluoroethylene copolymer thin films with various structures to elucidate the factors governing the switching characteristics of such films. It is shown that the spin-coated and well-annealed samples exhibit a remanent polarization Pr of 85 mC/m2. Unlike that in previous reports, the switching time taus of these samples is independent of thickness down to 50 nm if Au electrodes are used instead of Al electrodes. Thin films with different metal electrodes exhibit anisotropic taus due to a potential difference between metal electrodes produced by their work function difference. A train of unipolar short on-off electric field pulses induce a slow but full polarization reversal whose time evolution supports the nucleation and growth mechanism. Continuous switching under bipolar on-off electric field pulses reveals an accelerated polarization reversal with decreasing pulse width. This means that taus is a function of not only applied electric field but also the preceding poling conditions. Fatigue is significantly improved using Au electrodes instead of Al electrodes. The results are discussed in relation to the microscopic features of the VDF/TrFE copolymer and the underlying nucleation-growth mechanism},

  year={2006},
  volume={6},
  number={3},
  pages={421-428},
  abstract={A systematic experimental work has been carried out to investigate the effect of thicknesses of the Au and Ni layers in the bond pad metallization on the reliability of ball grid array (BGA) solder joints as well as to understand the mechanism of Au diffusion to the solder interface. BGA solder balls of Sn-37 wt.% Pb have been bonded on BGA solder bond pads of Au/electrolytic Ni/Cu by reflowing at 225 degC for 0.5 min. The thickness of the Ni layer was varied from 0.35 to 2.8 mum, while the thickness of Au layer was varied from 0.1 to 1.3 mum. Solid state aging at 150 degC up to 1000 h has been carried out to simulate the ultimate interfacial reactions during the operational life of electronic devices. Cross-sectional studies of the solder-to-bond pad interfaces have been conducted by scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer to investigate the interfacial reaction phenomena. Ball shear tests have been carried out to obtain the mechanical strength of the solder joints and to correlate shear behavior with the interfacial reaction products. After the shear tests, fracture surfaces have also been investigated to understand the fracture modes. It has been found that Au embrittlement in the BGA Sn-Pb solder joints on Au/Ni/Cu BGA bond pads can be reduced by using either a thin Au layer or a thin Ni layer in the trilayer metallization of Au/Ni/Cu. It is easy to understand why Au embrittlement is reduced when a thin Au layer in the BGA bond pad is used; however, contrary to the usual expectation, it has been realized in this paper that a very thin Ni metallization is an effective means to maintain the mechanical integrity of the BGA SnPb solder joint. It is revealed that the out-diffusion of the Cu atoms during the aging period changes the chemistry and morphology of the intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the solder interface, contributing to a significant reduction in brittleness. During aging at 150 degC, the thin Ni layer facilitates Cu diffusion from the bond pad toward IMCs. As a result, the brittle continuous layers of (Au,Ni)Sn4 and Ni 3Sn4 are transformed into a nodular-shaped discontinuous layer of AuSn4 and a layer of (Au,Cu,Ni)6 Sn5, respectively. New interfacial reaction products with the modified morphology change the typical scenario of Au embrittlement at the BGA solder interface and thus improve the interfacial joint strength significantly},

  abstract={Carbon nanotube transistor with bottom gate fabricated by atomic force microscopy based nanomanipulation system is presented in this paper. This process consists of fabrication of transistor chips using conventional optical lithography and nanoassembly of CNTs on the chips. It is found that the contact resistance between the CNT and Palladium electrodes can be as low as several hundred kΩ. By using this fabrication technique, high fabrication yield of CNT devices can be achieved. In addition, Polyimide serves as the dielectric layer and the packaging material of the transistor which allows us to modify transistor characteristic, because the Fermi level of CNTs shifted after annealing under vacuum. At low temperature, the polyimide has lower gas permeability and thereby, seals the CNT transistors.},

The study consists of two parts. First, the electron transport mechanisms in these structures are investigated using low-temperature (∼4K-300K) I-V measurements. The measured resistivity in CNF arrays are modeled based on known graphite a-axis (parallel to basal plane) and c-axis (perpendicular to basal plane) electron conduction mechanisms. The model is verified using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of the CNF-metal interface. Second, electrical reliability measurements are performed at different temperatures to demonstrate the robust nature of CNFs for interconnect applications. Finally, some guidance is presented in catalyst material selection to yield lower resistance CNFs.},

  abstract={Chromium nanodot deposition by atomic force microscopy (AFM) is demonstrated for the first time. An oscillating Cr-coated AFM cantilever is brought close to the substrate surface by the engage process in a wavemode operation and a negative tip voltage is applied to form a strong electrical field to transport the Cr atoms from the tip to the surface. An array of nine Cr nanodots around 90nm in diameter and 0.2nm to 0.3nm in height is fabricated by changing the tip positions at room temperature and in ambient conditions. It is found that the deposition is an intermittent contact process, which is avoided by most researchers for other metal nanoscale dot depositions, such as gold. A deposition mechanism is proposed, with supporting results from further experiments. Our research shows that it is possible to obtain much smaller features for application of nanoelectronics with this method by controlling the deposition time and the applied voltage.},

The platforms were microfabricated and compatible with any commercially available TEM holder. The nanowire dimensions (20-100 nm in diameter and 1-5 μm in length) were varied by controlling the deposition time and trench width. In situ observation during thermal annealing showed no grain growth in Al and sporadic grain growth in Au. The reason for no grain growth in Al could be due to Aluminum oxidle and surface morphology. Continued annealing of the Al nanowires melted the metal leaving behind aluminum oxide nanotubes.},

An advantage of the proposed design is that the high degree of precision of the mating feature relative to the optical guides ensures a high degree of concentricity of the optical path in the device.

  title={Adaptable End Effector for Atomic Force Microscopy Based Nanomanipulation}, 
  year={2006},
  volume={5},

  pages={628-642},
  abstract={Nanomanipulation using the atomic force microscope (AFM) has been extensively investigated for many years. But the efficiency and accuracy of AFM-based nanomanipulation are still major issues due to the nonlinearities and uncertainties in nanomanipulation operations. The deformation of the cantilever caused by manipulation force is one of the most major nonlinearities and uncertainties. It causes difficulties in accurately controlling the tip position, and results in missing the position of the object. The softness of the conventional cantilevers also causes the failure of manipulation of sticky nano-objects because the tip can easily slip over the nano-objects. In this paper, an active atomic force microscopy probe is used as an adaptable end effector to solve these problems by actively controlling the cantilever's flexibility or rigidity during nanomanipulation. A control voltage is applied to the piezo layer of the adaptable end effector to exert a reverse bending moment on the cantilever to balance the bending moment caused by the interaction force during manipulation. Thus, the adaptable end effector is controlled to maintain straight shape during manipulation. A detailed model of the adaptable end effector is presented in the paper. Control of the adaptable end effector employing an optimal LQR control law is derived and implemented. The experimental results verify the validity of the model and effectiveness of the controller. The nanomanipulation results also prove the increased efficiency of AFM-based nanomanipulation using the adaptable end effector},

  title={Transfer Function Analysis of the Micro Cantilever Used in Atomic Force Microscopy}, 
  year={2006},
  volume={5},
  number={6},
  pages={692-700},
  abstract={Current approaches to study the system response of the different modes of dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) use model simplification such as single mode approximations or are based on the nontrivial solution of the equation of motion. As an alternative to these approaches, the transfer function analysis gives a more complete description of system dynamics considering the cantilever as an extended vibrating structure. In order to describe the dynamics correctly, the precise experimental configuration has to be taken into account. This includes distinguishing between point loads (mechanical tip sample interaction) and distributed loads induced, e.g., by inertial driving or electrostatic forces. In this work we focus on a transfer function study of two different AFM configurations, the point force and distributed force driven cantilever. Exact analytical expressions of the infinite dimensional transfer function are derived for both possible system outputs: cantilever deflection and slope, which correspond to an interferometric and a light lever deflection detection system, respectively. Frequency response and transfer function infinite product expansion are obtained for the case where system outputs are set at the free end of the cantilever. In the frequency response, it is reflected the full complexity of cantilever dynamics affected by the presence of an infinite number of poles and zeros. An analytical expression for all the zeros and poles of the system is obtained. Using the transfer function, system dynamics are analyzed obtaining modal and antiresonant cantilever shapes along with its step response. From the frequency response, pole-zero investigations, and system dynamics, it is shown that both cantilever actuation and output measurement affect AFM operation. Transfer function analysis of AFM cantilevers improves the possibility of model-based AFM operation to increase imaging and manipulation performance},

  abstract={Soft lithography is a method for the manufacture of micro/nano size patterns and structures by using organic materials without the use of high energy. In particular, microcontact printing (muCP) is a very convenient and nonphotolithographic technique that can generate patterned features of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). In this study, we carried out the selective deposition of HfO2 nano-thin films on Si(100) substrates by combination of muCP using octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Single molecular precursor of Hf(OtBu) 4 was used for the growth of HfO2 nano-films, and the deposition was carried out between 150degC and 400degC at a pressure of 3times10-2 torr. The as-grown films were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) measurement. It is expected that the combination of muCP of SAM and MOCVD is a better method for fabricating the HfO 2 thin films between micro and nano sizes},

  abstract={In this paper we propose an approach in which interactive visualization and analysis are combined with batch tools for the processing of large data collections. Large and heterogeneous data collections are difficult to analyze and pose specific problems to interactive visualization. Application of the traditional interactive processing and visualization approaches as well as batch processing encounter considerable drawbacks for such large and heterogeneous data collections due to the amount and type of data. Computing resources are not sufficient for interactive exploration of the data and automated analysis has the disadvantage that the user has only limited control and feedback on the analysis process. In our approach, an analysis procedure with features and attributes of interest for the analysis is defined interactively. This procedure is used for offline processing of large collections of data sets. The results of the batch process along with "visual summaries" are used for further analysis. Visualization is not only used for the presentation of the result, but also as a tool to monitor the validity and quality of the operations performed during the batch process. Operations such as feature extraction and attribute calculation of the collected data sets are validated by visual inspection. This approach is illustrated by an extensive case study, in which a collection of confocal microscopy data sets is analyzed},

  year={2006},

  pages={1415-1421},
  abstract={This paper investigates the suitability of porous GaAs as a semiconductor material for sensing humidity. The authors have developed two types of sensors based on Pd/porous GaAs and Pd/GaAs Schottky contacts for humidity measurements. It was found that the porosity on GaAs wafer promoted the sensing properties of the contact used as highly sensitive humidity sensor toward different amounts of relative humidity operated at room temperature. On the contrary, the Pd/GaAs sample operated at room temperature exhibited negligible sensitivity to relative humidity. The advantages of using porous GaAs for Schottky humidity sensor are the following: high sensitivity, low response time, and insignificant dependence on temperature. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the Pd/porous GaAs Schottky humidity sensor exhibited a saturation current value of 8.5times10-10 A under dry condition (5% relative humidity). This was increased to 7.0times10-9 A when submitted to a relative humidity of 25%. The saturation current was further increased considerably to 3.0times10-7 A as the relative humidity was increased to 95%. This is more than two orders of magnitude increase in saturation current compared to dry condition. A parameter called humidity sensitivity was defined using the current value at a fixed forward voltage of 0.2 V to present the sensitivity of the sensor. Response times are reported to discuss the adsorption and desorption characteristics of the device. Pd/porous GaAs sensor operated at room temperature showed a fast response time of 2 s and a sensitivity value of 93.5% in the presence of 25% relative humidity. Furthermore, the influence of increase in relative humidity as well as heating effects on the responsivity of the sensor is described. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the Pd/porous GaAs sample exhibited highly porous structures},

  abstract={This paper reports the implementation and calibration of a microscopic three-electrode electrochemical sensor integrated with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel to form a rapid prototype chip technology that is used to develop sensing modules for biomolecular signals. The microfluidic/microelectronic fabrication process yields identical, highly uniform, and geometrically well-defined microelectrodes embedded in a microchannel network. Each three-microelectrode system consists of a Au working electrode with a nominal surface area of 9 mum2, a Cl2 plasma-treated Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a Au counter electrode. The patterned electrodes on the glass substrate are aligned and irreversibly bonded with a PDMS microchannel network giving a channel volume of 72 nL. The electrokinetic properties and the diffusion profile of the microchannels are investigated under electrokinetic flow and pressure-driven flow conditions. Cyclic voltammetry of 10 mM K3 Fe(CN)6 in 1 M KNO3 demonstrates that the electrode responses in the cell are characterized by linear diffusion. The voltammograms show that the system is a quasi-reversible redox process, with heterogeneous rate constants ranging from 3.11 to 4.94times10-3 cm/s for scan rates of 0.1-1 V/s. The current response in the cell is affected by the adsorption of the electroactive species on the electrode surface. In a low-current DNA hybridization detection experiment, the electrode cell is modified with single-stranded thiolated DNA. The electrocatalytic reduction of 27 muM Ru(NH3)6 3+ in a solution containing 2 mM Fe(CN)6 3- is measured before and after the exposure of the electrode cell to a 500-nM target DNA sample. The preliminary result showing an increase in the peak current response demonstrates the hybridization-based detection of a complementary target DNA sequence},

  pages={73-73},
  abstract={Ever since Pendry's paper on perfect lens the idea of near field subwavelength imaging has been a driving force in the rapid development of the field of metamaterials as the search for suitable structures capable of near field imaging continues. A large variety of physical mechanisms were suggested to be responsible for near field imaging, ranging from excitation of surface plasmon-polariton resonances and effective medium theory to imaging based on the curvature of the dispersion characteristics, phase conjugation or propagation of magnetoinductive (MI) waves. Experimentally, the so-called swiss roll lens (a single layer of resonant swiss rolls) was the first example of a magnetic metamaterial shown to be able to transfer subwavelength information from the object to the image plane. First explanations of imaging with a single layer of swiss rolls were based on the existence of a negative permeability region. A competing explanation is based on the microscopic description of the subwavelength physics of the structure taking into account strongly anisotropic magnetic coupling between individual elements. This coupling leads to propagation of slow MI waves in the vicinity of the resonant frequency thus preventing good imaging. Freire and Marques proposed to use a structure made of two parallel layers of magnetic metamaterial elements and suggested that in this case MI waves may play a positive role resulting in evanescent amplification of the fields in the inter-layer spacing. In this work, we review our recent theoretical and experimental results on magnetoinductive near field lenses. Our theoretical model is based on a coupled-mode approach for magnetoinductive waves developed to describe "bi-atomic" metamaterials with two magnetically coupled elements per unit cell. The model explains deficiencies of the swiss roll subwavelength lens of Wiltshire and clarifies the physical mechanism of the magnetoinductive lens of Freire and Marques. In order to achieve subwavelength imaging magnetic field spreading in the plane perpendicular to the axis connecting object and image must be prevented so that the field distribution of a subwavelength object can be transmitted through the device to the image plane with little distortion. We identify regimes of "pseudo" and "true" subwavelength imaging. The "pseudo" subwavelength imaging is possible outside the pass bands of magnetoinductive waves i.e. far away from the resonance frequency of individual resonators which results in a weak signal accompanied by a poor signal-to-noise ratio. The "true" subwavelength imaging is shown to be a highly resonant phenomenon manifested in a narrow frequency range close to the resonance frequency. Experimental results confirm theoretical predictions on a variety of structures designed to operate at frequencies around 46 MHz. Our approach can be employed for the design of three-dimensional subwavelength near field lenses made of periodically arranged loop-shaped resonators suitable for applications in magnetic resonance imaging systems},

  abstract={Human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) interface with a basement membrane in vivo that possesses complex nanoscale topographic features. We report that synthetic substrates patterned with nano- and microscale holes differentially modulate the proliferation, shape and adhesion of SV40 human corneal epithelial cells (SV40-HCECs) as a function of feature size: 1) Cell proliferation was inhibited on nanoscale features (features size less than 800 nm in pitch) compared to microscale features or planar substrates in identical culture conditions. 2)Cells on nanoscale holes had a stellate morphology compared to those on microscale features that were more evenly spread. 3) Cells adhered more to nanoscale features than to microscale features when exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber. Transmission electron microscopy showed that cells cultured on the 400 nm pitch patterns had longer and more numerous filopodia and retraction fibers than cells cultured on the 1600 nm pitch patterns. Immunogold labeling of -beta1 integrins revealed that these receptors were localized at the cell periphery and in the aforementioned cytoskeletal elements. Our findings indicate that surface discontinuities and the activation of mechanochemical cell signaling mechanisms may contribute to the observed responses exhibited by SV40-HCECs cultured on nano- and microscale topography},

  abstract={Morphology is very important in help neuro-scientists understand neuronal functions and connectivity of neurons. Using confocal microscopy researchers can acquire 3D images of neuronal axons in high resolution and study how axons innervate muscular fibers. To test different innervation models, researchers need to track every single axons and its branches in 3D. A robust segmentation and tracking method is needed to follow each axon in 3D. Challenges are that axons may appear touching each other in the image and make it difficult to segment. In addition, split and merge of axons require judicious image processing to correctly track axons in these cases. We present a 3-step segmentation and tracking algorithm to address these problems. Our proposed method includes nonlinear anisotropic diffusion for noise removal and edge enhancement, morphological operation for edge detection, and mean shift for tracking in three dimensions. The method can segment contacting objects and track the axons when they merge or split.},

  year={2006},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-2},
  abstract={In this paper, a framework of fast registration algorithm for large microscopy images is presented. The rationale behind this approach is that the rigid transform gives the global mapping between the two images while the nonrigid components further refines the local matching of the pixels by taking care of local nonrigid distortion and variation. Therefore, to estimate rigid transform, the global features such as specific anatomical structures need to be used instead of point features which does not contain any global information. Then to estimate local nonrigid transform, the local features such as points are used. The algorithm is divided into two stages: the first stage is to find an accurate estimate of the rigid (Euclidean) transform between the two images. To achieve this goal, high level (global) features such as small regions with anatomical meanings such as clusters of cells or blood vessels are exploited for matching purposes. A voting scheme is used to confirm the matching and compute the rigid transformation between two consecutive images. This then transforms the foundation for the second stage of nonrigid registration. Using the accurate estimate of the rigid transform, a large number of point feature correspondence is established and used as control points for the nonrigid transform},

  abstract={In this paper, we apply a multiple-instance learning (MIL) method, MILES (multiple-instance learning via embedded instance selection), to human histological image classification. MILES converts a MIL problem to a supervised learning problem by an instance-based feature mapping. 1-norm SVM is then adopted to select features and construct a classifier simultaneously. MILES identifies the sub-images that reflect underlying category concepts, and use them for classification. Experimental validation is provided based on images from different organs and parts of the body. The new approach demonstrates significantly improved performance in comparison with a method based on a Gaussian mixture model},

  abstract={Recent fundamental studies have given rise to the emergence of new applications for carbon-based nanostructures in electrical and biological systems. In this paper, our recent work investigating the utility of carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) devices in electrical and biological interconnect systems is reviewed. Electrical and structural characterizations of carbon nanostructure arrays are performed to assess the viability of these novel forms of carbon for interconnect applications. Structural information of carbon nanofiber arrays obtained with high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are correlated with electrical characteristics using a semi-empirical model developed based on graphite conduction principles. Concurrently, a microelectrode array consisting of a two-dimensional (2D) pattern of CNT recording sites is used to detect the electrical signals in embryonic rat hippocampal neurons in vitro. This experiment demonstrates the viability of using CNT to electrically probe living cells},

  abstract={Nanostructure characterization of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) for on-chip interconnect applications is presented. We propose a novel technique for characterizing interfacial nanostructures of vertically aligned CNFs, optimally suited for cross-sectional imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Using this technique, vertically aligned CNFs are selectively grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), on a substrate comprising a narrow strip (width ~100nm) formed by focused ion beam (FIB). Using high-resolution STEM, we show that CNFs with diameters ranging from 10-100 nm exhibit very similar graphitic layer morphologies at the base contact interface},

  abstract={It has been shown that under accelerated stress below ap4 V, thin gate oxides are subject to progressive breakdown (BD), i.e., a gradual growth of the BD spot up to a destructive BD. This paper investigates the conduction mechanisms of the BD spot during the early stages of progressive BD through the measurement of the I-V characteristics using carrier separation. It is shown that a model with no free parameter based on the concept of cotunneling provides a good evaluation of the post-BD current. This model implies a physical microstructure, and its plausibility is compared to direct transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations},

  abstract={Si nanocrystals are promising materials which can be used for optical sensor, memory devices and future optoelectronics devices. In this work we study the morphology surface and interface of the silicon rich oxide (SRO) films with different nanocrystals (nc-Si) embedded in a thin SiO2 matrix (Silicon excess). Also the surface roughness after annealing was investigated by means of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AFM images show different morphologies in the surface of the different films. The morphology changes could be associated to the gas flow ratio (Ro) and time of thermal treatment. All images demonstrated grain like structure with size nanometer, which was characterized by height distribution, average roughness, grain and pore mean diameter. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) reveals that a small layer formed in the surface of the SRO is SiO2 and the composition of the films ins in the volume varied with respect at the flow ratio, these data have allowed us to correlate the surface and interface structure with the composition of the SRO films},

  abstract={Using a DC pulsed plasma for polymer surface treatment allows to obtain macroscopic modifications of the surface such as an important increase of the wettability i.e., reduction in hydrophobicity. In the same time, it yields microscopic variations of the surface structure that are mainly due to low depth chemical modifications even if only weak roughness changes appear. As a consequence this technique presents two major interests: an economical interest because of the low power consumption compared to other techniques like radio-frequency or microwave plasmas, and a non-invasive interest: very significant macroscopic treatment realized in soft conditions without degradation of the polymer. Applications are numerous: glue and painting production, health industry, aeronautics, wood industry, textile industry. To characterize the benefits of this technique for polymer surface treatment, we present an image processing tool that yields macroscopic measures of wettability, through the estimation of drop contact angles. The process is automated, precise and low-cost. The measurement of contact angle helps to infer microscopic properties from macroscopic features extracted via the unsupervised image processing technique. Results of macroscopic and microscopic studies on polystyrene surfaces allow to establish a macroscopic interpretation of the interaction between polymer and the DC pulsed plasma},

  abstract={The non-linear friction is an important factor affecting the machine-finishing precision. The microscopic structure of friction contact surface is analysed, which is supposed as the viscoelasticity material. The modelling method of static friction is discussed. A partition friction model has been established separately in the pre-sliding regime and dynamic friction region. The friction in XY AC servo table is measured based on the new designed strain sensor, which is used to estimate the related parameter of the model. The compensation effect of two models is compared using the simulation software. The result indicates the tracking errors using the partition friction model proposed in this article is smaller than that of the static Stribeck model, which shows that the new model can reflect the friction characteristic of the static friction stage.},
