  abstract={The development of novel fuel-cell materials demands accurate and flexible microstructure characterization techniques. Conventional electron microscopy-based microstructural morphology analysis is carried out through the conceptual interpretation of transmission electron microscope images. With this method, only qualitative information on material morphologies can usually be obtained. This paper presents a digital image analysis system that deals with the automatic measurement and quantitative characterization of the microstructural morphologies of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel-cell materials. In this approach, two types of essential microstructural morphologies (spheral particles and interconnected graft channels) are modeled based on statistical geometry theory, and the statistical analysis schemes of the microstructural morphologies are designed and applied to the characterization of the phase-separated microstructures in fuel-cell components such as solid electrolyte ionomers, catalyst layers, and gas diffusion layers. Experimental results on real fuel-cell materials specimens demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract={This work presents a graph-based representation (a.k.a., cell-graph) of histopathological images for automated cancer diagnosis by probabilistically assigning a link between a pair of cells (or cell clusters). Since the node set of a cell-graph can include a cluster of cells as well as individual ones, it enables working with low-cost, low-magnification photomicrographs. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it is shown that without establishing a pairwise spatial relation between the cells (i.e., the edges of a cell-graph), neither the spatial distribution of the cells nor the texture analysis of the images yields accurate results for tissue level diagnosis of brain cancer called malignant glioma. Second, this work defines a set of global metrics by processing the entire cell-graph to capture tissue level information coded into the histopathological images. In this work, the results are obtained on the photomicrographs of 646 archival brain biopsy samples of 60 different patients. It is shown that the global metrics of cell-graphs distinguish cancerous tissues from noncancerous ones with high accuracy (at least 99 percent accuracy for healthy tissues with lower cellular density level, and at least 92 percent accuracy for benign tissues with similar high cellular density level such as nonneoplastic reactive/inflammatory conditions).},

  abstract={We report the results of an investigation of the laser-material interaction processes involved in laser drilling of alumina, through the use of an enhanced peak power (2.5 kW) CO/sub 2/ laser and novel temporal pulse formats. Peak power was varied from 30 W to 2 kW for pulses of constant energy to observe the effect produced on scribe depth. High-speed videography of hole formation has been combined with microscopic analysis to investigate the key processes involved in laser processing of alumina. Plasma screening was observed for short, high peak power laser pulses, and optimal scribing was achieved in the weakly plasma absorbing regime. A new processing technique for scribing alumina has been developed, which exploits the fast response of the laser to produce novel temporal pulse shapes, which can be modified to generate cleaner holes. Scribe speeds of up to 280 mm/spl middot/s/sup -1/ were obtained for scribe holes >200 /spl mu/m deep and 150 /spl mu/m apart, with no material plugging the hole, in 0.635-mm-thick 96% alumina.},

  abstract={It is well known that particles can be freely levitated in an electric field due to the charge induced on the particles by the external field. The charge depends upon the electric field strength and particle properties. This paper studies some of these factors to investigate the fundamentals of induction charging for granular materials. An experimental apparatus was set up to collect the levitated particles in a filter contained in a Faraday pail and the charge-to-mass (Q/M) ratio was obtained based on the charge and mass measurements for the samples in the filter. Furthermore, the particle size distribution was measured and analyzed by laser diffraction and microscopy and the surface mean diameter (D/sub s/) and volume mean diameter (D/sub v/) were obtained. In these experiments irregular shaped Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ particles and spherical glass beads with a size range of 42-390 /spl mu/m were used and tested at different electric field strengths. By combining the results of Q/M, D/sub s/ and D/sub v/, the charge per particle was calculated and the results compared with theoretical values. It was confirmed that the particle charge is dependent upon the electric field strength and the particle properties of size, shape, density, resistivity, and adhesive force.},

  title={Three-dimensional reconstruction and quantification of cervical carcinoma invasion fronts from histological serial sections}, 
  year={2005},

  number={10},
  pages={1286-1307},
  abstract={The analysis of the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of tumoral invasion fronts of carcinoma of the uterine cervix is the prerequisite for understanding their architectural-functional relationship. The variation range of the invasion patterns known so far reaches from a smooth tumor-host boundary surface to more diffusely spreading patterns, which all are supposed to have a different prognostic relevance. As a very decisive limitation of previous studies, all morphological assessments just could be done verbally referring to single histological sections. Therefore, the intention of this paper is to get an objective quantification of tumor invasion based on 3-D reconstructed tumoral tissue data. The image processing chain introduced here is capable to reconstruct selected parts of tumor invasion fronts from histological serial sections of remarkable extent (90-500 slices). While potentially gaining good accuracy and reasonably high resolution, microtome cutting of large serial sections especially may induce severe artifacts like distortions, folds, fissures or gaps. Starting from stacks of digitized transmitted light color images, an overall of three registration steps are the main parts of the presented algorithm. By this, we achieved the most detailed 3-D reconstruction of the invasion of solid tumors so far. Once reconstructed, the invasion front of the segmented tumor is quantified using discrete compactness.},

  year={2005},
  volume={24},
  number={10},
  pages={1369-1376},
  abstract={Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel, high-resolution diagnostic tool that is capable of imaging the arterial wall and plaques. The differentiation between different types of atherosclerotic plaque is based on qualitative differences in gray levels and structural appearance. We hypothesize that a quantitative data analysis of the OCT signal allows measurement of light attenuation by the local tissue components, which can facilitate quantitative spatial discrimination between plaque constituents. High-resolution OCT images (at 800 nm) of human atherosclerotic arterial segments obtained at autopsy were histologically validated. Using a new, simple analysis algorithm, which incorporates the confocal properties of the OCT system, the light attenuation coefficients for these constituents were determined: for diffuse intimal thickening (5.5/spl plusmn/1.2 mm/sup -1/) and lipid-rich regions (3.2/spl plusmn/1.1 mm/sup -1/), the attenuation differed significantly from media (9.9/spl plusmn/1.8 mm/sup -1/), calcifications (11.1/spl plusmn/4.9 mm/sup -1/) and thrombi (11.2/spl plusmn/2.3 mm/sup -1/) (p<0.01). These proof of principle studies show that simple quantitative analysis of the OCT signals allows spatial determination of the intrinsic optical attenuation coefficient of atherosclerotic tissue components within regions of interest. Combining morphological imaging by OCT with the observed differences in optical attenuation coefficients of the various regions may enhance discrimination between various plaque types.},

  pages={1118-1126},
  abstract={In this paper, we report on the design, fabrication, and implementation of ultrasensitive micromechanical oscillators. Our ultrathin single-crystal silicon cantilevers with integrated magnetic structures are the first of their kind: They are fabricated using a novel high-yield process in which magnetic film patterning and deposition are combined with cantilever fabrication. These novel devices have been developed for use as cantilever magnetometers and as force sensors in nuclear magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). These two applications have achieved nanometer-scale resolution using the cantilevers described in this work. Current magnetic moment sensitivity achieved for the devices, when used as magnetometers, is 10/sup -15/ J/T at room temperature, which is more than a 1000-fold improvement in sensitivity, compared to conventional magnetometers. Current room temperature force sensitivity of MRFM cantilevers is /spl sim/10/sup -16/ N//spl radic/Hz, which is comparable to the room temperature sensitivities of similar devices of its type. Finite element modeling was used to improve design parameters, ensure that the devices meet experimental demands, and correlate mode shape with observed results. The photolithographic fabrication process was optimized, yielding an average of /spl sim/85% and alignment better than 1 /spl mu/m. Postfabrication-focused ion-beam milling was used to further pattern the integrated magnetic structures when nanometer scale dimensions were required.},

It was found that the sensitive interplay between exchange, demagnetizing, and shape anisotropy energies leads to distinct magnetization configurations and magnetic switching mechanisms (in low frequencies), even though the geometric shape of elements is only slightly modified. In a particular case, such as 40% elongated element, vortex-driven magnetic switching is replaced by well-defined coherent reversal. Fast magnetization reversal is, however, found to be slightly dependent on as-patterned domain configurations. For all elements investigated, the fast reversal leads to very complex nonequilibrium domain configurations.},

The films exhibit good magnetic softness and perpendicular or inplane uniaxial anisotropy that determines high frequency characteristics.

Magnetization curves, susceptibility and transmission electron microscopic images support speculation of microscopic granular structure and origin of anisotropy. Very high deposition speed is possible without serious deterioration of magnetic softness. High controllability of anisotropy and high speed deposition are advantageous from the industrial standpoint.},

  abstract={To fully understand a magnetic film's potential for data storage it is necessary to measure its complete magnetization. Although magnetic force microscopy (MFM) cannot perform this measurement, its simplicity leads us to examine its full potential for characterizing recording performance. For example, if MFM measurements of a film can be used to develop a corresponding micromagnetic model, then the model may provide insight into the film's recording performance. With this goal in mind, a technique is described that associates model magnetization patterns with MFM measurements. These patterns represent longitudinal recording films and are restricted to be uniform over grains that form a Voronoi tessellation of the film plane. Each grain's magnetization can be rotated such that the simulated MFM response from the pattern has a high cross correlation with measured data. While this technique does not produce a unique pattern for a given MFM measurement, it does provide information on what level of granularity is necessary to achieve a particular cross correlation and suggests the scale of the magnetic feature size.},

According to the results of high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis, the prepared iron oxide particles had the average particle sizes between 4 and 6 nm and very uniform size distributions. The crystal structure analyzed by using both XRD and Mo/spl uml/ssbauer spectra confirmed that the prepared iron oxide nanoparticles only have single magnetite (Fe/sub 3/O/sub 4/) crystal phase. The typical superparamagnetic behaviors were observed from the prepared iron-oxide nanoparticles. In addition, they showed the saturation magnetization, M/sub S/ of 59.5 emu/g for 4 nm, and of 59.7 emu/g for 6 nm, respectively at room temperature under the externally applied magnetic field of 10 kOe.

  abstract={Dedicated experiments have been carried out in vacuum to study breakdown and arc burning on graphite cathodes covered by a thick (1 /spl mu/m) tungsten layer. The motivation originates from the usage of similar layers as first wall material in fusion devices where a large number of arcs appeared during plasma operation. Besides the standard measurements of current and voltage optical observations of the developing cathode spot and the retrograde motion in a transverse magnetic field on a short time scale have been carried out to determine the arc velocity reliably. Special attention was payed to nonreversible modifications of the layer by arcing. Electron microscopy and surface analysis techniques (SIMS, AES) have been applied to specify the geometric structure of the tracks together with the distribution of elements. Main result is the observation that a 1 /spl mu/m tungsten layer can permanently be perforated by the passing of an arc exposing carbon from the underlying graphite to all subsequent erosion processes. The effect depends on arc type as well as current, and is used to extract information from remnant tracks found on plasma facing components.},

  volume={14},

  pages={1736-1746},
  abstract={In this paper, we define a connected operator that either fills or retains the holes of the connected sets depending on application-specific criteria that are increasing in the set theoretic sense. We refer to this class of connected operators as inclusion filters, which are shown to be increasing, idempotent, and self dual (gray-level inversion invariance). We demonstrate self duality for 8-adjacency on a discrete Cartesian grid. Inclusion filters are defined first for binary-valued images, and then the definition is extended to grayscale imagery. It is also shown that inclusion filters are levelings, a larger class of connected operators. Several important applications of inclusion filters are demonstrated-automatic segmentation of the lung cavities from magnetic resonance imagery, user interactive shape delineation in content-based image retrieval, registration of intravital microscopic video sequences, and detection and tracking of cells from these sequences. The numerical performance measures on 100-cell tracking experiments show that the use of inclusion filter improves the total number of frames successfully tracked by five times and provides a threefold reduction in the overall position error.},

Structural investigations reveal that the Co-wires have a polycrystalline morphology. Electron diffraction patterns indicate the predominance of hexagonal close packed (HCP) Co. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) investigations show that all Co-wires are in a single-domain state at remanence with the magnetization lying in-plane along the long wire axis due to their strong shape anisotropy.},

Magnetoresistance loops are measured between the sweeping field /spl plusmn/4000 Oe at varying angles between external field and longitudinal axis. The resistances in remanent state of s-shape wire are found to be almost same value for every angle. On the other hand, the resistances of half-ring wire are found to be decreasing with increasing angle. Magnetic force microscopy images of the wires confirm the varied resistances result from different domain structures on the corners with domain wall or without domain wall. The domain wall resistance (DWR) in half-ring wires is estimated to be about 0.31%. Theoretical calculations based on impurity scattering model and spin accumulation model are done to validate the experimental data. DWR from spin accumulation model is 0.012%/spl sim/0.031% and from impurity scattering model, it is 0.15%/spl sim/0.33%.},

When biocompatible chitosan was applied in magnetic suspension, various values of the surface charge of the magnetite were acquired. Phagocytic uptake should be avoided in targeting magnetic particles to other organs and tissues such as liver and spleen. 2 wt% chitosan-based magnetite suspension with a zeta potential close to zero showed a reduced phagocytic uptake in comparison with charged particles.},

  abstract={The magnetization configurations and reversal dynamics of Ni/sub 80/Fe/sub 20/ thin film elements are investigated by magnetic force microscopy (MFM), magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and micromagnetic simulations. The results from MOKE experiments indicate that there is a striking difference in the switching behavior between "Pac man" shaped elements (PM-I and EPM-I). For the PM-I, the hysteresis loop shows an intermediate jump, which is an indication of the vortex driven reversal process. In contrast to this, the EPM-I element undergoes a coherent switching process, which is characterized by a simple jump from one magnetization state to the other, and the loop shape approaches a perfect square. Micromagnetic simulations based on Landau Liftshitz-Gilbert equation further explain how the magnetic switching dynamics is influenced by distinct as-patterned magnetization state for given element geometries, when the elements undergo ultrafast magnetization reversal. It is found that the half-select switching is strongly dependent on the relative time delay between word and digital pulses.},

RHEED images reveal that further increasing the annealing temperature to more than 200/spl deg/C, the disappearance of the clear rings from the Cu or the Al surfaces can be recognized due to the structural change by the alloying or segregation in both Al/Cu and Cu/Al bi-layer samples. Topographic images of the sample unoxidized with bias voltage of 0.5 V show round shape microstructures and there are both bright and dark areas in the electric current (conductive AFM) image where a bright one means apparently the shape of the metallic channels on the surface of the NOL.

The bacterial magnetite nanoparticles can be coated inside or outside the peptide nanotubes depending on the synthesis condition. The structure and morphology of MPNs were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the magnetic properties were characterized using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Results show that the assembled morphology and resulting magnetic behavior of Fe/sub 3/O/sub 4/ nanoparticles coated on the nanotubes depend on the synthesis condition and indeed vary with the concentration of the nanoparticles in the solution. The magnetic behavior clearly reflects the geometry of the magnetic particles. The magnetic properties of nickel nanoparticles mineralized and coated onto peptide nanotubes are governed by the particle size and crystallinity, controlled by the pH during the synthesis.},

  abstract={Molecular-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have attracted a lot of attention, not only because of their unusual properties but also due to their potential biomedical applications. Preliminary genetic and toxicity tests with a magnetic fluid (MF) sample based on magnetite nanoparticles surface-coated with polyaspartic acid (PAMF) showed reasonable biocompatibility. Nevertheless, biodistribution aspects of PAMF sample were not investigated yet. In the present study PAMF was given as an intravenous bolus dose to mice, while magnetic resonance and light microscopy were used to investigate biodistribution parameters. The magnetic resonance (MR) spectra revealed a broad single line around g = 2, typical of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) suspended in a nonmagnetic matrix. All samples collected from the liver, spleen and lung presented similar MR spectra with no visible multiple features. Control tissue samples showed no resonance signal. MR analysis revealed that 10 minutes after injection the highest concentrations of PAMF nanoparticles were in the liver and blood. Nevertheless, at 60 minutes the highest concentrations of PAMF nanoparticles were in spleen and lung. PAMF signals were not detected in the blood 30 minutes after PAMF injection. In accordance with MR data, light microscopy analysis showed the presence of MNP clusters in the spleen, liver, and lungs. Nevertheless, in spite of the presence of MNP clusters in the organs, no morphological alterations or inflammatory process were observed. Several data on literature show that aspartic acid may effectively inhibit the tumor cell growth or increase the antitumor activities of several chemotherapeutic drugs. Taken together these data indicate that MNPs surface-treated with polyaspartic acid may be considered as a potential precursor of anticancer drugs.},

  pages={318-323},
  abstract={Many small motors are used in automobiles. In an automotive fuel pump system, a small DC motor is widely used to drive the pump. The motor is installed in a gasoline tank, so that the coil current is commutated in gasoline, and arc voltage and duration differ from those in air. In this research, the authors use carbon brush and carbon flat commutator, and investigate relationship between surface morphology of commutator and commutation waveform. Under high inductance and large commutation current, effective commutation interval becomes very short, because black parts damaged by arcing on the commutator invade from the edge of segments. Then, effective commutation interval becomes very short, and arc duration and residual current increase rapidly. Observing surfaces of tested commutator by a laser microscope, the depth of arcing part maybe becomes larger with operations. Commutator and brush lifetimes are short with large commutation current, but the process of wear is similar to the result at small commutation current. Then, relationship between arc duration and surface morphology of commutator is investigated by a laser microscopy. The results show that arc duration affects both width and depth of black parts damaged by arcing.},

Such length scales are accessible by different forms of microscopy but scanning probe methods allow both chemical and physical measurements to be made, in addition to morphological and typographical imaging, at nanoscopic and mesoscopic length scales. These measurements are described in this paper with examples drawn from many areas of dielectric research and applications, including polymer morphology, surface and subsurface charge measurements along with the dynamics of charge-decay, surface potential and work function, microelectronics, ferroelectrics, photocharging, dielectric response and nanoscopic relaxation and nanoscopic Raman spectroscopy. The future of scanning probe methods for dielectric measurements is assured but more effort is required to both develop and consolidate this form of nano-metrology.},

  abstract={This paper describes the fabrication and characterization of optical/electrical printed circuit boards (O/E-PCB) with embedded multimodal step index (MM-SI) waveguides and integrated out-of-plane micromirrors (IMMs) for three-dimensional (3-D) optical interconnects. Optical circuitry is built up on PCBs using UV lithography; 45/spl deg/ input/output (I/O) couplers are fabricated by inclined exposure. Commercial polymers are used as optical core and cladding materials. Critical mirror properties of angle, surface quality, reflectivity, and coupling efficiency are characterized experimentally and theoretically. Optical and scanning electron microscopy, white light interferometry, and fiber scanning method are used in the investigations. Sloping profiles measured as a function of the incident light showed the attainment of mirror angles of /spl alpha/=36/spl deg/-45/spl deg/ with /spl plusmn/2/spl deg/ consistency. Near-field optical imaging with a white light source showed that out-of-plane beam turning was achieved. Topography investigations revealed a rectilinear negative tapering shape regardless of the incoming beam angle or type of substrate. However, higher substrate reflectancy was observed to lower the mirror angle. The average propagation loss measured for 10-cm-long waveguides at /spl lambda/=850 nm by the cut-back method was 0.60 dB/cm; the excess loss calculated for the mirror coupling was 1.8-2.3 dB. The results showed that the IMMs can be incorporated in O/E-PCBs to couple light in and out of planar waveguides. Furthermore, the presented results indicate that optical waveguides with integrated micromirrors for optical 3-D wiring can be produced compatible with volume manufacturing techniques.},

The element-phase composition of the silicide films was determined by scanning electron X-ray microanalyzer. Si and Mn doping depth profiles of the samples were presented. As a result of the experimental investigation we found optimal operating conditions to grow polycrystalline higher manganese silicide films.

  abstract={Agent-based traffic simulation has emerged as an efficient tool to investigate traffic phenomenon. However, the main problem is how to reproduce realistic patterns of traffic flow at both macroscopic and microscopic levels with restricted computational resources. In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework of single-lane traffic simulation. We focus on the driver-vehicle agents, which is the most important ones in the framework. The three-layer architecture of driver-vehicle agents is proposed, the decision tree of tactical longitudinal movement is put forward, and the simplified formulas of acceleration and deceleration rate are derived. With parallel update mode of agent states, a one-dimension traffic simulation model is developed. To validate it at the macroscopic level, we reproduced the realistic flow-density and speed-density relation of traffic flow with periodic boundary condition. To validate it at the microscopic level, a platoon of 10 vehicles was simulated. Given four kinds of typical speed profiles of the leader, each follower can follow its leader safely and stably. The result shows that this model can reproduce realistic macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of single-lane traffic flow.},

  abstract={The consecutive hurricane attacks to US coastline have drawn significant attentions to evacuation operations related issues. To better prepare the state of Maryland for potential hurricanes, this study presents an emergency evacuation system that integrates both optimization and microscopic simulation methods. The optimization module applies a two-level process to generate the preliminary optimal control plans, which is based on a revised cell transmission formulation for large-scale network applications. Using the optimized results as the initial input, the simulation module takes into account various operational constraints and driver responses that are difficult to be captured realistically with mathematical formulations. The proposed system also features its flexibility for potential users to adjust the optimized plans in both the planning phase and real-time operations based on the results of simulation evaluation. The case study with the data from Ocean City, Maryland during hurricane attacks has demonstrated the potential of the proposed system for evacuation of traffic flows in large-scale networks within a given time window.},

A first physiological microscopic model of liver vascularization, allows simulating the evolution of the contrast material concentration.

  abstract={It is very important to identify the pathology components of urine solution and acquire a result of clinical examination. It aids to diagnose diseases of the urology system. Because the particles such as urinary sediments are irregular in shape and fuzzy in edge, it is much more difficult to automatically detect particles in microscopic images. Texture segmentation involves subdividing an image into differently textured regions. Many segmentation based on Gabor filters are derived from Gabor elementary functions. We present a new robust method for the problem of automatically detecting the particles' location in images. We have devised a more rigorously Gabor-based method enhancing the edge information for designing Gabor filters. We argue that Gabor filter outputs can be modeled as Gaussian's and develop a new algorithm for selecting optimal filter parameters.},

  abstract={We have designed, fabricated, and investigated a new dual-stage actuator system based on a thin-film lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) microactuator and a voice coil motor for positioning a magnetic head in a high-density hard disk drive (HDD). We made the PZT microactuator by using a modified sol-gel technique to deposit PZT thin film and applying reactive ion etching processes to shape the device. We studied the crystalline structure and growth behavior of the piezoelectric films by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy and found that the PZT material preferably has a composition of Pb(Zr/sub 0.52/Ti/sub 0/.48)O/sub 3/. We also tested and simulated the U-type SUS304 substrate integrated with two single-layer PZT elements in order to investigate the driving mechanics. The device performance is outstanding. With the peak-to-peak head displacement of 1.08 /spl mu/m at the applied voltage of /spl plusmn/20 V and the suspension response frequency higher than 12 kHz, both displacement/voltage sensitivity and resonant frequency are high enough for the device to be used in future high-density HDDs.},

  pages={270-273},
  abstract={The extraordinary transmission phenomenon has stimulated much interest in recent years. Based on the extraordinary transmission and directional beaming phenomena proposed by Ebbesen et al., a new optical head structures, nonmetal optical head, are presented in this letter. Nonmetal optical head composed of dielectric surface grating on a metallic thin film was proposed. We also offer the physical origin for the directional beaming of light emerging from a single subwavelength slit in the metallic film that has dielectric grating feature on the exit side. Both of experiments and numerical simulations were implemented, and they were shown eventually to agree with this surface plasmon diffraction very well. The main reason for designing nonmetal optical head proposed in this letter is for mass production possibilities of nanoimprint technique. It is very important to know the mechanism which drives the directional beaming phenomenon for nonmetal optical head. Therefore, a design rule for desired nonmetal optical head is presented. Another novel optical design proposed is double slits optical head. Light emerging from the two slits cross at the desired focal length, which is decided by the distance between the two slits. Also, two light beam interference to become a subwavelength light beam. Various applications may appear because of the understanding of this nano-optics device, from this design, for example, an optical switch or an optical sensor, optical lithography, optical storage, and optical microscopy, and so on.},

  abstract={The potential of cytopathologic diagnoses to detect cancer of a variety of types non-invasively, cost-efficiently and up to three years ahead of conventional histopathologic diagnoses can be increased by the application of adjuvant methods, i.e. the combination of different stainings. For further improvement of cytopathology we introduced multimodal cell analysis (MMCA) which combines specific information about identical cells in different stainings successively applied to the same microscope slide. This requires a precise relocation and coregistration of individual cells under scrutiny. As a precondition for application in daily routine and screening settings the crucial relocation of cells has to be automated. The paper describes a method for an automatic retrieval of images of cells which have already been selected and recorded in a preceding staining together with their coordinates. Due to inevitable mechanical inaccuracies the geometric match is insufficient. The comparison of nuclear constellations based on segmentations in both stains facilitates an automatic correction of the position even if there is a subscene matching only. The process furthermore generates the initial guess for the succeeding coregistration which thereby gains robustness. The success rate of the method described is about 85%.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. The accuracy of the histological classification of cells plays a determining role in disease diagnosis and treatment. Recent studies have shown that the distribution of chromatin-associated proteins reflects alterations in cell phenotype. Using 3D fluorescence images of cultured human breast epithelial cells with multiple known phenotypes, we have developed an automated method to classify the phenotype of epithelial cells based on their nuclear protein distribution. Features which describe the distribution of specific nuclear proteins are first measured, on a per nucleus basis, by our local bright feature (LBF) analysis technique. Features from thousands of nuclei with multiple, known phenotypes were then grouped by a novel voting-based clustering method into a number of clusters of similar pattern. This allows us to establish the statistical link between clusters and the phenotypes of the cells. Finally, we used this statistical link to predict the probable phenotype of individual or groups of nuclei. The results show that the combined use of 3D confocal imaging, image feature analysis, and clustering analysis provides an efficient way to predict the phenotype of epithelial cells based on the nuclear distribution of chromatin-associated proteins.},

  abstract={Summary form only is given. Today, hybrid experimental approaches for capturing molecular structures (henceforth, complexes), utilizing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), electron tomography (ET), X-ray crystallography (X-ray) or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), need to be ably complemented with faster and more accurate computational and geometric processing for ultrastructure elucidation at the best level of resolution that is possible. This talk shall describe some of our recent efforts in three dimensional geometric post-processing once a volumetric EM or ET map (henceforth a 3D Map) has been reconstructed, as essential steps towards an enhanced and automated computational structure determination pipeline. In particular we shall address 3D Map filtering, automated structural feature determination including local symmetry detection and boundary segmentation, as well as secondary structure fitting for constructing quasi-atomic protein models. Visualization techniques for interactive exploration of large 3D maps and docked structures shall also be highlighted.},

  abstract={The effect of basal plane dislocations (BPDs) on the characteristics of diffused 4H-SiC p-i-n diodes was investigated. BPDs were intentionally introduced in the active regions of the device by means of epi-layer surface damage followed by high temperature annealing. Secondary electron microscopy images of the fabricated diodes clearly show the presence of the deliberately introduced BPDs. The current-voltage and electroluminescence spectra measurements did not reveal any noticeable effect of the BPDs on the electrical and optical properties of the diodes. All tested diodes with and without BPDs have no forward voltage drift during long-term on-state operation. A possible reason for stable device performance may be the immobilization of defects responsible for forward voltage drift due to interaction with the diffused dopants.},

  title={Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI}, 
  year={2005},
  volume={24},
  number={12},
  pages={1611-1625},
  abstract={Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most commonly occurring cancer among men in the United States, second only to skin cancer. Currently, the only definitive method to ascertain the presence of prostatic cancer is by trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) directed biopsy. Owing to the poor image quality of ultrasound, the accuracy of TRUS is only 20%-25%. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to have a higher accuracy of prostate cancer detection compared to ultrasound. Consequently, several researchers have been exploring the use of high resolution MRI in performing prostate biopsies. Visual detection of prostate cancer, however, continues to be difficult owing to its apparent lack of shape, and the fact that several malignant and benign structures have overlapping intensity and texture characteristics. In this paper, we present a fully automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system for detecting prostatic adenocarcinoma from 4 Tesla ex vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imagery of the prostate. After the acquired MR images have been corrected for background inhomogeneity and nonstandardness, novel three-dimensional (3-D) texture features are extracted from the 3-D MRI scene. A Bayesian classifier then assigns each image voxel a "likelihood" of malignancy for each feature independently. The "likelihood" images generated in this fashion are then combined using an optimally weighted feature combination scheme. Quantitative evaluation was performed by comparing the CAD results with the manually ascertained ground truth for the tumor on the MRI. The tumor labels on the MR slices were determined manually by an expert by visually registering the MR slices with the corresponding regions on the histology slices. We evaluated our CAD system on a total of 33 two-dimensional (2-D) MR slices from five different 3-D MR prostate studies. Five slices from two different glands were used for training. Our feature combination scheme was found to outperform the individual texture features, and also other popularly used feature combination methods, including AdaBoost, ensemble averaging, and majority voting. Further, in several instances our CAD system performed better than the experts in terms of accuracy, the expert segmentations being determined solely from visual inspection of the MRI data. In addition, the intrasystem variability (changes in CAD accuracy with changes in values of system parameters) was significantly lower than the corresponding intraobserver and interobserver variability. CAD performance was found to be very similar for different training sets. Future work will focus on extending the methodology to guide high-resolution MRI-assisted in vivo prostate biopsies.},

  abstract={Exploring the role of neuron's morphological change in brain function or neurological disorders is a long-time goal in many neuroscience fields. The arrival of digital microscopy, such as two-photon and confocal laser scanning microscopy, coupled with a large arsenal of fluorescent and other labeling methods to study the neuron 3D structure and dynamics in cell culture, brain tissue culture, and even live animals, has become a powerful technique that allows the neuroscientists to gather objective, quantitative and reproducible cell-based phenotype information. It offers tremendous value to localize, identify and characterize brain cells and subcellular components at different animal models. It enables better understanding of cellular changes underlying the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. Nevertheless, there are significant bioinformatics challenges in processing, managing, analyzing, modeling, and mining large volumes of multi-dimensional neuronal images generated by high resolution optical microscopy in studying dynamic neuronal information. The existing bioimaging tools are extremely limited in their scope and capacity. The scientists have to rely on slow and restrictive manual analysis to extract information. Image informatics has become the rate-limiting factor in neuroscience imaging studies. We aim to fill this gap by developing an image informatics platform, neuronal image quantitator (NeuronIQ), with increased capacity to identify and track neuronal objects and to analyze and quantitate object features extracted from the large amounts of images generated by optical microscopy, providing a complete picture of the evolution of the morphological features and behaviors of neurons and related cellular objects in time and space, and under different experimental conditions. This would lead to rapid cell-based assays to obtain and analyze broad ranges of neuronal phenotypes and facilitate the extraction of previously undecipherable information from neuronal morphology. In this paper, the author presents some of the ongoing work and applications of NeuronIQ in deciphering biological mechanisms and behaviors of neurological disorders. Summary form only given.},

The popularity and practicality of nanoparticle materials create a need for a synthesis method that produces quality particles in sizable quantities. This paper describes such a method, one that uses bacterial synthesis to create nanoparticles of magnetite. The thermophilic bacterial strain Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus TOR-39 was incubated under anaerobic conditions at 65/spl deg/C for two weeks in aqueous solution containing Fe ions from a magnetite precursor (akaganeite). Magnetite particles formed outside of bacterial cells. We verified particle size and morphology by using dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Average crystallite size was 45 nm. We characterized the magnetic properties by using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer; a saturation magnetization of 77 emu/g was observed at 5 K. These results are comparable to those for chemically synthesized magnetite nanoparticles.},

  abstract={The Mars Exploration Rovers, spirit and opportunity, have spent several successful months on Mars, returning gigabytes of images and spectral data to scientists on Earth. One of the instruments on the MER rovers, the Athena microscopic imager (MI), is a fixed focus, megapixel camera providing a /spl plusmn/3mm depth of field and a 31/spl times/31 mm field of view at a working distance of 63 mm from the lens to the object being imaged. In order to maximize the science return from this instrument, we developed the Ames MI toolkit and supported its use during the primary mission. The MI toolkit is a set of programs that operate on collections of MI images, with the goal of making the data more understandable to the scientists on the ground. Because of the limited depth of field of the camera, and the often highly variable topography of the terrain being imaged, MI images of a given rock are often taken as a stack, with the instrument deployment device (IDD) moving along a computed normal vector, pausing every few millimeters for the MI to acquire an image. The MI toolkit provides image registration and focal section merging, which combine these images to form a single, maximally in-focus image, while compensating for changes in lighting as well as parallax due to the motion of the camera. The MI toolkit also provides a 3D reconstruction of the surface being imaged using stereo and can embed 2D MI images as texture maps into 3D meshes produced by other imagers on board the rover to provide context. The 2D images and 3D meshes output from the toolkit are easily viewed by scientists using other mission tools, such as Viz or the MI browser. This paper describes the MI toolkit in detail, as well as our experience using it with scientists at JPL during the primary MER mission.},

The hardness and morphology of enamel surface were investigated by microhardness meter and scanning electron microscopy. Compared with control, the group with 0.3 W laser treatment has the least caries lesion (p<0.001). At the same time, the mechanism of caries prevention and acid resistance by laser was discussed in detail. We drew a conclusion that the change of contents in enamel and crystal orientations and partial decomposition of the organic matrix might be the main reason for enhancing acid resistance. And best caries inhibition could be achieved when the temperature rising of enamel surface was in the range of 300-400/spl deg/C by laser parameters being controlled suitably.},

In this paper, we consider the construction and selective presentation of cells of the Morse-Smale complex and their use in the analysis and visualization of scientific datasets. We take advantage of the fact that cells of different dimension often characterize different types of features present in the data. For example, critical points pinpoint changes in topology by showing where components of the level sets are created, destroyed or modified in genus. Edges of the Morse-Smale complex extract filament-like features that are not explicitly modeled in the original data. Interactive selection and rendering of portions of the Morse-Smale complex introduces fundamental data management challenges due to the unstructured nature of the complex even for structured inputs. We describe a data structure that stores the Morse-Smale complex and allows efficient selective traversal of regions of interest. Finally, we illustrate the practical use of this approach by applying it to cryo-electron microscopy data of protein molecules.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations of a potential failure mode for Cu lines subjected to alternating thermal loads. Wide Cu lines with 200 nm thickness were produced on a Si/SiO2/SiNx wafer by a series of conventional microfabrication steps. Alternating currents (AC) with a frequency of 100 Hz was then applied to the Cu lines and produced temperature cycles with a range of 190degC due to Joule heating. The cyclic temperature change gave rise to a cyclic strain in the Cu line due to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the metal line and the wafer. The thermally-induced mechanical cyclic loading leads to the formation of severe damage in the Cu lines, such as thinning along the twins and wrinkles in the grain. Eventually the AC loading leads to local melting and electrical failure of the Cu line. TEM investigations revealed that constrained diffusional creep and the interaction of dislocations with twins and other interfaces play an important role in the development of damage. The results for Cu lines tested under thermal fatigue conditions are compared with the microstructure and damage morphology of films tested under pure mechanical fatigue and the important differences and the corresponding damage mechanisms are discussed},

  pages={377-381},
  abstract={Ultrasonic wire bonding is one of the most important techniques for die interconnection in microelectronic packaging. It is widely used for power devices, microwave devices and photoelectron devices packaging. At room temperature, ultrasonic energy and plastic deformation energy, generated by metal wire plastic deformation under the wedge tool pressure, make the wire and metallization join together. The ultrasonic bonds, after bonding and aging, of Al+1%Si wire with 25/spl mu/m diameter bonded on the Au/Ni/Cu pad, are analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDX). The joints begin at the bond periphery where it is the location of the greatest plastic flow. It is found that the mechanism of ultrasonic bonding is, both the plastic flow of metal wire generated by wedge tool pressure which results in the diffusion of Ni into Al wire; and the effect of ultrasound is that, on the one hand, ultrasonic vibration enhances the metal wire ability of plastic flow and, on the other hand, it generates many defects inside the metal wire which are the fast diffusion channels. The diffusion type is likely the short-circuit diffusion, which is more prominent than the crystal diffusion when the temperature is low. After high temperature storage at 170 /spl deg/C for 10 days, there is evident diffusion of Ni into Al wire, but the microstructure is the same with the bonds after bonding, there is no evident change. Aged for 30 days, the bond interface forms a cloud-like structure, and the major composition is Al and Ni with weight percent of 78.82% and 15.55% respectively. However, the diffusion is not even and some parts of the bond interface are absence of Ni diffusion. When the aging time is 40 days, the cloud-like structure transforms into rectangular island-like structure and there are many cavities inside the bond wire, which are different from the Kirkendall voids because of the shape and dimension.},

To reduce the oxidation tendency of magnesium during melting and casting process, a special device was employed. The melting characteristic of SnAgCuMg solders was evaluated and compared with Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu alloy by differential thermal analysis (DTA). The microstructure observation was carried out by means of optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It showed that SnAgCu solder tends to melt at lower temperature with the addition of Mg. Without typical Ag3Sn/β-Sn eutectic microstructure, SnAgCuMg solders present different microstructures from eutectic Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu. Some Sn, Ag, Mg-rich polygons were found among β-Sn matrix of SnAgCuMg solders by energy dispersed spectrum (EDS).},

  abstract={Microscopic analysis of malicious code (malware) requires the aid of a variety of powerful tools. Chief among them is a debugger that enables runtime binary analysis at an instruction level. One of the important services provided by a debugger is the ability to stop execution of code at an arbitrary point during runtime, using breakpoints. Software breakpoints support an unlimited number of breakpoint locations by changing the code being debugged so that it can be interrupted during runtime. Most, if not all, malware are very sensitive to code modification with self-modifying and/or self-checking (SM-SC) capabilities, rendering the use of software breakpoints limited in their scope. Hardware breakpoints supported by the underlying processor, on the other hand, use a subset of the processor register set and exception mechanisms to provide breakpoints that do not entail code modification. This makes hardware breakpoints the most powerful breakpoint mechanism for malware analysis. However, current processors provide a very limited number of hardware breakpoints (typically 2-4 locations). Thus, a serious restriction is imposed on the debugger to set a desired number of breakpoints without resorting to the limited alternative of software breakpoints. Also, with the ever evolving nature of malware, there are techniques being employed that prevent the use of hardware breakpoints. This calls for a new breakpoint mechanism that retains the features of hardware breakpoints while providing an unlimited number of breakpoints, which cannot be detected or countered. In this paper, we present the concept of stealth breakpoints and discuss the design and implementation of VAMPiRE, a realization of this concept. VAMPiRE cannot be detected or countered and provides unlimited number of breakpoints to be set on code, data, and I/O with the same precision as that of hardware breakpoints. It does so by employing a subtle combination of simple stealth techniques using virtual memory and hardware single-stepping mechanisms that are available on all processors, old and new. This technique makes VAMPiRE portable to any architecture, providing powerful breakpoint ability similar to hardware breakpoints for microscopic malware analysis},

  abstract={In this paper, a type of nano-hybrid polyimide/silica film was prepared by hydrolysis and condensation of methyl-triethoxysilane that served as the precursor of the inorganic moiety and produced the nano-particle of silica, in-situ, in the polyamic acid solution through a sol-gel reaction. The chemical structure and surface morphology of the films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Atomic force microscopy respectively. The properties of the films, such as thermal stability and corona-resistance property were investigated as a function of the SiO/sub 2/ content. The structure-property response on the hybrid system was also discussed. The result of the experiments indicate that the properties of the nano-hybrid materials were not only relative to the inorganic component content of the system, but also to the morphology between the inorganic and organic phases and the character of the interface. It proved that a strong interaction existed between the two phases when a coupling agent is added into the polyimide/silica composite system and that it would play a significant role in improving the miscibility between the two phases, and in reducing the size of the inorganic particles. It also showed that no apparent change had occurred in the thermal decomposition temperature of the hybrid film and the corona-resistance property of the hybrid film had greatly improved as a result of the inorganic component being added into polyimide resin matrix.},

  abstract={This paper presents results from the application of a thermally self-consistent Monte Carlo (MC) simulator to In/sub 0.15/Ga/sub 0.85/As/Al/sub 0.28/Ga/sub 0.72/As HEMTs. The simulator employs an iterative procedure which couples a MC electronic trajectory simulation with a fast Fourier series solution of the heat diffusion equation (HDE). Monte Carlo is one of the most accurate methods for simulating sub-micron semiconductor devices, as it is free from low-field, near-equilibrium approximations. In addition, the microscopic description of electron-phonon scattering in this method provides an inherent prediction of the spatial distribution of heat generation within a device. The thermal power distribution calculated from the net rate of phonon emission is fed to an HDE solver. The resulting temperature distribution is incorporated into the subsequent MC iteration. Electronic transport is simulated using three-valley spherical non-parabolic energy bandstructures. The simulations consider both the effect of optical and acoustic phonons mediating intravalley and intervalley electronic transitions. Ionised impurity, alloy disorder and electron-electron scattering processes are also included. The expected thermal droop is observed from the I-V characteristics of the simulated devices. Temperature distributions associated with different thermal power distributions are shown to be non-uniform with maximum values dependent upon the bias and the semiconductor die dimensions.},

  abstract={A new probe for scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) that exploits field concentration at a metal tip allows to image single dye molecules at a resolution far beyond the diffraction limit.

An image of single Cy-3 fluorophores covalently attached to the termini of DNA. In fluorescence, the dyes appear as characteristic patterns with details of 10 nm in width. The patterns indicate field concentration at the metal tip and simultaneously fluorescence quenching. Modeling of the data allows determining the position of the dyes at sub-nm accuracy and, at the same time, the 3-D orientation of the dyes. As an important feature of our probe, the metal tip simultaneously provides high-resolution topographic imaging. The evaluation of two independent co-localized signals (fluorescence and topography) allows a much clearer interpretation of the sample than possible with one signal alone. With this unique combination of qualities the new probe promises exciting applications in various fields of nanoscience, in particular in molecular and cellular biology},

  abstract={In this presentation, we present our THZ ANSOM and characterisation of the system of generation and detection of terahertz waves. Recent reports show a great potential of apertureless near-field scanning optical microscopy (ANSOM or ASNOM) applied to terahertz (THz) frequency domain, also called far infrared domain (0.1 to 10 THz). THz imaging brings an improved optical contrast that enables the identification of unique rotational and vibrational responses of various materials within this frequency range. But main drawback of THz imaging is weak resolution of images, limited by diffraction. We have also developed a spectroscopic system based on an interferometric technique. It is possible to record the linear autocorrelation of the terahertz electric field by scanning the optical path between the two arms of a Michelson interferometer. The terahertz spectrum is then obtained by numerical computation of the Fourier transform. For each point of the 2D near field image, one can reach a spectroscopic information. Morphologic and spectroscopic analysis can be simultaneously proceeded.},

Vascularization is fundamental to healing, reproduction as well as embryonic development. It also plays a key role in tumor growth, tumor metastasis and other pathological processes.

Recently, an analytical model capable of mimicking the process of in-vitro vascular network creation from randomly seeded endothelial cells has also been proposed. This paper presents the development of a novel neural network based segmentation technique working on phase contrast microscopy snap photographs of cultured endothelial cells which allows for cell structures geometry quantitative analysis thus constituting a key instrument in the development of computerized tools for vascularization parameters measurement as well as supporting also analytical model deployment and validation.},

  abstract={It is believed that space charge build-up in cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation is the main cause of premature failure of underground power cables. The space charge activities in XLPE depend on many factors such as additives, material treatment, ambient temperature, insulator/electrode interface, etc. Degassing is the process of subjecting the XLPE to a moderately high temperature, thereby removing volatile residual by-products and additives that are commonly employed in cable manufacturing to improve insulation performance. While there have been reports comparing space charge activities (as-received) un-degassed and degassed samples, little attention has been placed on degassing conditions effect on space charge. In this paper, investigations of morphology and space charge distribution of planar XLPE samples was carried out as parameters such as degassing temperature, degassing duration and sample thickness were adjusted. Changes in the morphological structure of the material were probed with the differential scanning calorimeter and the transmission electron microscopy, whereas space charge distribution of the samples subjected to DC electric stress was monitored for 24 h using the laser induced pressure pulsed technique. It was revealed that degassing temperature, duration and the thickness of the degassed sample has a direct effect on the morphological structure and space charge distributions of the samples. It is believed that the presence and amount of by-products takes precedence over the morphology of the material as far as space charge evolution is concerned.},

  pages={778-781 Vol. 1},
  abstract={It has been shown that a sub-wavelength nanoprobe (consisting of a sharpened optical fiber with a nanoscale optical aperture) can be used to produce microscopy images with spatial resolutions smaller than the optical wavelength. While these optical devices have been available for a decade, there use in near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) systems is limited by the nonuniformity of the probe fabrication process, and the complexity of the signal processing and control electronics. Recently, a new MEMS based probe fabrication process was developed that enables the production of nanoprobes with uniform and repeatable physical and optical characteristics. In this paper we investigate the possibility of integrating a nanoprobe with a CMOS based signal processing circuitry. When coupled with the new optical nanoprobes, this technology could potentially be used in the design and implementation of a compact NSOM system and thus enable the cost effective introduction of NSOM technology into a new set of applications including biomedical imaging and ultra high density data storage. Fabricated using an AMI 1.5 /spl mu/m CMOS process, the core of this project involves the design and fabrication of a CMOS chip that includes four different CMOS photoreceiver circuits V-grooves which are fabricated using a MEMS based post process etching step. The V-grooves are used for passive alignment of optical nanoprobes with the on-chip CMOS based photodetectors which are realized using the N-well/P-substrate junction. This photodiode has been used in all four types of the photoreceiver circuits in order to accommodate nW optical input signals. Based on recent development of CMOS photosensor technology, two types of active pixel and two types of passive pixel circuits have been designed. All four circuits are based on charging/discharging a capacitor to perform integration of the photogenerated current. If the integration process is linear and charging/discharging current I is a constant a simple relationship of /spl Delta/V//spl Delta/t = I/C should be satisfied. For maximum possible /spl Delta/V of 5 volts, there exists a maximum allowable sampling period for specific value of the charging/discharging current and integration capacitor. Unfortunately, in each circuit the value of charging/discharging current and total capacitance including parasitic capacitances are hard to determine. According to the T-SPICE simulation, a comparison of maximum allowable sampling period vs. photocurrent for four different photoreceiver circuits laid out is presented. Photoreceiver circuit evaluation and comparison have also done experimentally by using both the packaged and unpackaged die. Following the experimental confirmation that the photoreceiver circuits function as designed, the unpackaged die is post processed to produce the V-groove structures, and circuit evaluations are again done to access any performance degradation resulting from the post processing step. Finally, nanoprobes are attached into the V-grooves and the performance of the integrated optical nanoprobe with CMOS photoreceiver circuitry is evaluated.},

  abstract={Nowadays, video-based fire-detection is a nearly common application, as the number of installed surveillance video-systems is growing and the related processing units getting more powerful. The fire-detection-feature is usually only an add-on feature of 'intelligent' surveillance video-systems. The detection-criteria are therefore based on macroscopic characteristics observable in the surveillance video, like particular smoke dynamics, flame flickering or loss of image contrast due to obscuration by the smoke. In a new approach not the macroscopic, but the microscopic characteristics of aerosols are analysed with view to a more reliable discrimination between fire and non-fire aerosols. By monitoring an illuminated sheet of air some centimeters under the ceiling of a room, it is possible to get information about a limited range of the particle size distribution, density and flow characteristics of the suspended aerosol. A prototype of the scanning system has been developed and a series of test-fires (according to the EN54) and non-fire tests has been carried out in the Duisburg-Fire-Detection-Laboratory. The comparison between the test-fires and the non-fire scenarios shows that the discrimination between fire and non-fire aerosols is cogitable. The analyses of the aerosol characteristics are based on adapted pattern recognition techniques applied in the image processing. Some differences between different aerosol types are even visible to the naked eye. This paper presents the developed prototype specifying important features. Afterwards the most interesting results are shown and commented. Finally, the possibilities and limitations of an automatic fire-detection system based on the microscope-video analysis are discussed.},

  abstract={Fuzzy Gaussian mixture modeling method is proposed in this paper for the computerized classification of cell nuclei in different mitotic phases. A mixture of Gaussian distributions was used to represent the cell data in multi-dimensional cell feature space. Gaussian parameters were estimated using fuzzy c-means estimation. The method was tested with the data set containing 379519 cells in 5 phases extracted from real image sequences recorded at every fifteen minutes with a time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method is more effective than the Gaussian mixture modeling method.},

  abstract={We present a snake (active contour) model based on repulsive force to segment neurons obtained from microscopy. Based on these segmentation results, we track the neurons in 3D image to look for its branch structure. These segmentation results allow user to study morphology of neurons to further investigate neuronal function and connectivity. This repulsive snake model can successfully segment two or multiple neurons that are close to each other by some alternating repulsive force generated from the neighboring objects. We apply our results on real data to demonstrate the performance of our method.},

  abstract={Through the use of patterned SiC substrates that have regions that are free of surface steps, we have previously reported the growth of high-quality GaN heteroepitaxial films with threading dislocation densities on the order of 107/cm2 (Bassim et al., 2005). In addition to the low-defect densities, we have observed a defect substructure in which lateral a-type dislocations annihilate run parallel to the heterointerface both in the nucleation layer and early in the subsequent GaN growth (Bassim et al., 2005; Bassim et al., 2004). Conversely, regions that have surface steps also have accompanying threading dislocations with screw-components in the GaN layer. This study focuses further on the role of substrate surface steps in the generation of misfit, a-type, and threading dislocations at the heteroepitaxial interface. By using weak-beam and dark-field imaging of plan-view TEM samples of stepped and unstepped mesas as well as stereo microscopy, we show dislocations generated on hillocks and flat surfaces and compare their geometries},

  abstract={The paper provides an overview of resonant sensors based on CMOS technology. Applications of these sensors range from inertial sensors to chemical/biochemical sensors, from atomic force microscopy to high-frequency filters. CMOS technology enables to co-integrate the resonant microstructures with necessary analog and digital circuit functions. The paper discusses CMOS-based fabrication approaches for resonant sensors, possible sensing and actuation schemes, suitable resonator materials, geometries and vibration modes. Two CMOS-based microsystems are highlighted: (i) a resonant chemical sensor and (ii) a resonant magnetic field sensor},

  abstract={For the first time, the sol-gel derived dielectric barium strontium titanate (BST) film has been explored as a transducer material for biosensor. Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of monododecyl phosphate (DDPO4) has been coated on the BST film from aqueous solution of the alkyl phosphate ammonium salts, resulting in a highly hydrophobic surface with water contact angle of 99.8 deg compared to the original contact angle of 40.8 deg for the bare BST surface. The microscopic features and the biosensing properties were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- as a redox couple. AFM images revealed the well immobilized BSA on the SAM modified BST surface. The EIS results showed significant increase in the electron transfer resistance compared to all other electrical elements in the equivalent circuit. Specific binding of anti-BSA on the immobilized BSA surface was observed by AFM imaging and EIS measurements. It was found that the specific binding of anti-BSA can be sensitively detected by measuring the electron transfer resistance. The present investigation indicates the potential of dielectric BST for electrochemical biosensor applications},
