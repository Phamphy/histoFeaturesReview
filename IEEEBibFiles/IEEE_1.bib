  abstract={We have performed simultaneous measurements of microwave absorption/reflection and magneto-transport characteristics of a high-mobility two-dimensional electrons in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure in the regime of microwave-induced resistance oscillations (MIROs). It is shown that the electrodynamic aspect of the problem is important in these experiments. In the absorption experiments, a broad cyclotron resonance line was observed due to a large reflection from the highly conductive electron gas. There were no additional features observed related to absorption at harmonics of the cyclotron resonance. In near-field reflection experiments, a very different oscillation pattern was revealed when compared to MIROs. The oscillation pattern observed in the reflection experiments is probably due to plasma effects occurring in a finite-size sample. The whole microscopic picture of MIROs is more complicated than simply a resonant absorption at harmonics of the cyclotron resonance. Nevertheless, the experimental observations are in good agreement with the model by Ryzhii et al. involving the photo-assisted scattering in the presence of a crossed magnetic field and dc bias. The observed damping factor of MIROs may be attributed to a change in the electron mobility as a function of temperature.},

  pages={287-299},
  abstract={We propose a registration system to be used for tracking cells in intravital video microscopy that 1) stabilizes jitter-the undesired translational displacement of frames due to respiratory movement, etc ., and 2) registers frames in a moving field of view (FOV) to allow for cell tracking over an extended range. For the first time, tracking of rolling leukocytes in vivo over a moving FOV is demonstrated. In a fixed FOV, stable background regions are located using a morphological approach. Template subregions are then selected from the stable regions and matched to corresponding locations in a reference frame. We show the effectiveness of the stabilization algorithm by using an active contour to track 15 leukocytes previously untrackable due to jitter. For 30 fixed FOV sequences containing rolling leukocytes, the resulting root-mean-square error (RMSE) is less than 0.5 /spl mu/m. To align frames in a moving FOV, we present a modified correlation approach to estimate the common region between two consecutive fixed FOVs. We correlate the overlapping regions of the initial frame of the current fixed FOV and the final frame of the previous fixed FOV to register the images in the adjoining moving FOV. The RMSE of our moving FOV registration technique was less than 0.6 /spl mu/m. In 10 sequences from different venules, we were able to track 11 cells using an active contour approach over moving FOVs.},

The results show a nonuniform conductivity of the oxide at the BD area and that the total current flowing through the device is mainly driven by a very small fraction of that region.},

  abstract={We have examined the magnetic anisotropy of the "heat-treated FePt nanoparticles" annealed in a magnetic field. The magnetic easy axis of the "heat-treated FePt nanoparticles" is found to be three-dimensional (3-D) random and a partial ordering fct structure is observed before annealing in the presence of a magnetic field. The value of M/sub r//M/sub s/ obtained is 0.5. After annealing in the presence of a magnetic field, the M-H loop indicates that the easy axis is oriented preferably in the perpendicular direction than along the in-plane direction. The value of H/sub c/(//)/H/sub c/(/spl perp/) at 10 K is 0.62 (1410 Oe/2250 Oe). The value of M/sub r//M/sub s/(/spl perp/) is 0.58 at 10 K larger than the value of M/sub r//M/sub s/(//). Therefore, a weak magnetic easy axis orientation is fundamentally possible on the chemically synthesized FePt nanoparticles. We have studied the recording characteristics of a 3-D random nanoparticle medium using a GUZIK spinstand and observed the recorded patterns for the medium by imaging with a magnetic force microscopy.},

  volume={12},
  number={1},
  pages={98-103},
  abstract={This paper considers the statistical theory of electrical breakdowns in high voltage (HV) devices. The extended probability distribution of breakdown is deduced for nonuniform gaps. The breakdown of high voltage apparatus is sensitive to local irregularity of the electric field which may result from the presence of defects such as surface roughness. The surface roughness leads to existence of localized microscopic projection with local electric field strength at the projection top larger than the average field at the electrode surface. The link between parameters determining the probability of electrical breakdown and the parameters determining microscopic geometry of electrode surface is obtained. In this paper a simplified breakdown model is used as a basis for statistical treatment. According to the model the breakdown proceeds if the electric field strength at the projection top exceeds the critical value. The method of dielectric strength calculation for HV devices using a simplified model of breakdown is presented. The paper gives an example of calculation of the breakdown voltage for vacuum switch TVS-43. Results of calculations are compared with available experimental data and Weibull distribution},

  year={2005},
  volume={12},
  number={1},
  pages={50-59},
  abstract={Gapless metal oxide surge arresters (MOSA) have been available in the market for many years since they were first introduced in the 1970's. The aim of this study is to investigate some reliable diagnostic techniques to assess the condition of a metal oxide surge arrester when subjected to severe lightning strikes in the field. A number of nondestructive and destructive diagnostic techniques for metal oxide surge arrester (MOSA) are discussed in this paper. The nondestructive techniques include the standard 1 mA reference voltage, lightning impulse discharge residual voltage and a number of modern diagnostics based on polarization methods: Return voltage and polarization/depolarization current measurements. In order to observe, analyze and correctly explain the degradation phenomena, a number of destructive techniques based on microstructure observation are also conducted. The techniques include optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectrometry. The single and multipulse currents of 8/20 mus wave shape were used to artificially degrade the MOSA. The before and after diagnostic results of the nondestructive and destructive techniques are presented and interpreted to understand the aging mechanism in MOSA. The importance of modern nondestructive electrical diagnostics based on polarization methods is validated by test results and is highlighted in detail in this paper. Finally the correlation of the results of different diagnostic techniques with each other and with the results of standard techniques is discussed},

  title={Effect of red cell clustering and anisotropy on ultrasound blood backscatter: a Monte Carlo study}, 
  year={2005},
  volume={52},
  number={1},
  pages={94-103},
  abstract={When flowing at a low shear rate, blood appears hyperechogenic on ultrasound B-scans. The formation of red blood cell (RBC) aggregates that also alters blood viscosity is the microscopic mechanism explaining this acoustical phenomenon. In this study, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to predict how RBC clustering increases ultrasound scattering by blood. A bidimensional Gibbs-Markov random point process parameterized by the adhesion energy epsi and an anisotropy index nu was used to describe RBC positions for a hematocrit H=40%. The frequency dependence of the backscattering coefficient chi(f) was computed using Born approximation. The backscattering coefficient chi0 at 5 MHz and the spectral slopes and nx and ny (chipropf(nx) or f(ny)) measured, respectively, when the insonification is parallel and perpendicular with the RBC cluster axis were then extracted. Under isotropic conditions, chi0 increased up to 7 dB with epsi and nx=n y decreased from 4.2 to 3.4. Under anisotropic conditions, the backscattering was stronger perpendicularly to aggregate axis, resulting in nx<ny. The anisotropy in scattering appeared more pronounced when epsi or nu increased. These two dimensional results generally predict that low-frequency blood backscatter is related to cluster dimension, and higher-frequency properties are affected by finer morphological features as anisotropy. This numerically establishes that ultrasound backscatter spectroscopy on a large frequency range is pertinent to characterize in situ hemorheology},

  abstract={High-resolution optical techniques for imaging magnetic domains in ferromagnetic materials such as confocal microscopy and scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) are reviewed. The imaging capabilities of different techniques and image formation are discussed in the case of in-plane as well as out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in different illumination configurations. It is shown that the magnetooptical resolution of near-field measurements depends on the film thickness and is limited by the diffraction on magnetic domains throughout the film. For thin magnetic films, subwavelength resolution can be attained. In addition to well-known near-field magnetooptical effects (out-of plane magnetization sensitivity of linear near-field microscopy and in-plane magnetization sensitivity of nonlinear near-field measurements), linear SNOM imaging of in-plane magnetization in thin magnetic films as well as nonlinear imaging of out-of-plane domains has been demonstrated. Thus, linear and second-harmonic near-field imaging of both in-plane and out-of-plane oriented magnetic domains can be achieved in transparent and opaque specimens. This enables applications of SNOM for studies of all kinds of magnetic materials. High-resolution optical imaging is required for characterization of the micro-magnetic and magnetooptical properties of novel magnetic structures in order to adopt a bottom-up approach in the search for new materials with improved characteristics.},

  abstract={The post-breakdown (BD) degradation of ultrathin gate oxide Si MOSFET devices is studied by electrical characterization, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, and theoretical simulation. It is shown that MOSFET devices can remain functional even if a physically direct short between the gate electrode and Si substrate is established. On the other hand, a device can suffer from total failure while no physical damages can be observed under TEM. The physical location of the BD point is shown to be of critical importance in determining the type of BD and the post-BD electrical characteristics of the device. The ability to precisely categorize the gate oxide BD modes in narrow MOSFETs enables us to reevaluate the impact of the gate dielectric BD on the post-BD device performance, and its influence at the circuit levels.},

  abstract={We have demonstrated the fabrication of n/sup +/-p gated diodes using low-temperature annealing of 700/spl deg/C for 30 s with a significantly reduced junction leakage current. This is achieved with the incorporation of an epitaxially grown Si/sub 1-y/C/sub y/(y=0.0007) layer in the substrate located at the end-of-range (EOR) of arsenic implantations. The carbon devices show effectively suppressed EOR defects in the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images and leakage characteristics similar to the controlled silicon device fabricated under high-temperature annealing of 950/spl deg/C for 30 s. Arrhenius measurement of the leakage profiles has indicated identical leakage mechanism for both the pure silicon and carbon devices, thus signifying the substantial elimination of the secondary EOR defects resulted from the implantations despite the low-temperature annealing of the latter.},

  volume={24},
  number={4},
  pages={514-528},
  abstract={Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) elastography visualizes local radial strain of arteries in so-called elastograms to detect rupture-prone plaques. However, due to the unknown arterial stress distribution these elastograms cannot be directly interpreted as a morphology and material composition image. To overcome this limitation we have developed a method that reconstructs a Young's modulus image from an elastogram. This method is especially suited for thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFAs), i.e., plaques with a media region containing a lipid pool covered by a cap. Reconstruction is done by a minimization algorithm that matches the strain image output, calculated with a parametric finite element model (PFEM) representation of a TCFA, to an elastogram by iteratively updating the PFEM geometry and material parameters. These geometry parameters delineate the TCFA media, lipid pool and cap regions by circles. The material parameter for each region is a Young's modulus, E/sub M/, E/sub L/, and E/sub C/, respectively. The method was successfully tested on computer-simulated TCFAs (n=2), one defined by circles, the other by tracing TCFA histology, and additionally on a physical phantom (n=1) having a stiff wall (measured E/sub M/=16.8 kPa) with an eccentric soft region (measured E/sub L/=4.2 kPa). Finally, it was applied on human coronary plaques in vitro (n=1) and in vivo (n=1). The corresponding simulated and measured elastograms of these plaques showed radial strain values from 0% up to 2% at a pressure differential of 20, 20, 1, 20, and 1 mmHg respectively. The used/reconstructed Young's moduli [kPa] were for the circular plaque E/sub L/=50/66, E/sub M/=1500/1484, E/sub C/=2000/2047, for the traced plaque E/sub L/=25/1, E/sub M/=1000/1148, E/sub C/=1500/1491, for the phantom E/sub L/=4.2/4 kPa, E/sub M/=16.8/16, for the in vitro plaque E/sub L/=n.a./29, E/sub M/=n.a./647, E/sub C/=n.a./1784 kPa and for the in vivo plaque E/sub L/=n.a./2, E/sub M/=n.a./188, E/sub C/=n.a./188 kPa.},

  abstract={We have found that in-plane magnetostriction characteristics at low fields can be greatly improved by an oblique sputtering technique.

The in-plane magnetization of TbFe films at 1600 kA/m is drastically increased with a change of deposition angles from 90/spl deg/ to 15/spl deg/. Magnetic domain structures explored by magnetic force microscopy indicate that the easy magnetization directions of the films can be gradually changed from perpendicular to the film plane at sufficiently shallow deposition angles. The in-plane magnetostrictive coefficients /spl lambda/ at 16 kA/m also can be increased by decreasing the deposition angles from 90/spl deg/ to 15/spl deg/. The significant variation in the in-plane magnetic and magnetostrictive performances can be explained by the decrease of perpendicular anisotropy of TbFe films.},

  abstract={A dynamic procedure for selective information fusion from multiple image frames is derived from robust error estimation theory. The fusion rate is driven by the anisotropic gain function, defined to be the difference between the Gaussian smoothed-edge maps of a given input frame and of an evolving synthetic output frame. The gain function achieves both selection and rapid fusion of relatively sharper features from each input frame compared to the synthetic frame. Effective applications are demonstrated for image sharpening in imaging through atmospheric turbulence, for multispectral fusion of the RGB spectral components of a scene, for removal of blurred visual obstructions from in front of a distant focused scene, and for high-resolution two-dimensional display of three-dimensional objects in microscopy.},

From observed containments of transaction execution time periods, we estimate the probabilities of accidental and non-accidental containments, and build a competitive model for discovering direct dependencies by using a model estimation method based on the online EM algorithm. Utilizing the discovered dependency information, we also propose a hierarchical problem detection framework, where microscopic dependency information is incorporated with a macroscopic anomaly metric that monitors the behavior of the system as a whole. This feature is made possible by employing a network-based design which provides overall information of the system without any impact on the performance.},

  abstract={Owing to their fascinating bonding nature, the metal-metal (M-M) multiple bonds in dinuclear metal complexes have been an interesting and vital research topic. During the past decade, our seminal and systematic approaches on the all-syn oligo-(/spl alpha/-pyridyl)amido ligands coordinated metal ions have successfully opened up a new chapter, extending this territory from dinuclear to linear oligonuclear metal complexes. Their unique features in structures and bonding characterization have been thoroughly investigated, which, according to the M-M bonding strength, can be classified into two categories, namely the oligonickel (II) complexes lacking an M-M bond and the oligochromium (II) complexes with a strong M-M bonding formation. Depending on the specificity and number of metal ions, structures and magnetic behaviors of the corresponding metal complexes are systematically analyzed. Their potential application as a molecular metal wire is conveyed on the basis of the band structures calculated from hypothetical one-dimensional metal strings. Moreover, self-assembled monolayers of n-alkanethiols are employed as a two-dimensional matrix to isolate the metal string complexes, of which the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) image exhibits remarkable protrusion characteristics. For tricobalt and trichromium complexes, the topographic STM images reveal that the protruding features are, respectively, 0.3 nm and 0.6 nm higher than that of the trinickel complexes. The trend of increasing conductivity correlates well with their associated bond orders, and is also in consistence with qualitative EHMO approaches. The ET efficiency of metal strings is altered significantly upon oxidation. It demonstrates that their ET properties can be manipulated and shed light on the potential applications such as molecular switches.},

  abstract={The paper presents an automatic extraction method for apoptotic cells from video microscopy images. Apoptosis, which is also called programmed cell death, is well-known to be closely related to various diseases. Detection of apoptotic cells can help scientists to study apoptosis and to reveal its mechanism, so that new medical technologies can be exploited. Scientists often analyze the images acquired by video microscopes with some sort of image analysis tools. However, it is usual that the performance of the tools is not enough to detect thoroughly the apoptotic cells, thus researchers have to detect apoptotic cells in the images manually. The paper proposes a method, based on their inherent shape features, to detect apoptotic cells automatically. The proposed method is applied to real world video microscopy images containing apoptotic cells and the results demonstrate its high performance to extract the cells successfully.},

  title={Blind deconvolution using a monotonicity constraint on the PSF},

  pages={ii/629-ii/632 Vol. 2},
  abstract={It is well recognized that blind deconvolution is a severely ill-posed problem and proper constraints on the image and the system point spread function (PSF) should be applied to counteract the ill-posedness. In this paper we investigate a novel PSF constraint, the monotonicity, which means the value of the PSF monotonically decreases (or does not increase) from the center of its support. We regard the monotonicity as a common property of many simplified but well accepted PSF models, such as the geometrical model of defocus, the Gaussian model and the synthetic model in astronomical imaging. The property is utilized as a PSF constraint in a novel iterative blind deconvolution algorithm RL-CLSE. Experiments on real microscopic data show that the proposed constraint can significantly improve the quality and stability of blind deconvolution.},

  year={2005},

  number={2},
  pages={278-287},
  abstract={The semiconductor device trend for increasing functionalities and performances yet with smaller overall feature sizes presents escalating obstacles to the decreasing form factor along with demanding thermal carrying capability required at the package level. To confront this compounding issue, ultrafine-pitch wirebond interconnect coupled with thermally enhanced copper heat spreader attached to the package are introduced. However, the additional copper heat spreader thickness introduced within the package challenges the design of the package's wire, its loop height, and the molding process control to prevent wire sweeping occurrences. This study investigates the impact of different ultrafine pitched wire types, wire loop designs, copper heat spreader structures, and mold material types on eliminating device short from occurring due to the wire sweeping phenomena. A full factorial experiment is performed using an active silicon device packaged in a thermally enhanced ball grid array (BGA) test vehicle. In addition, test characterization is carried out using x-ray and multiinsertions hot/cold continuity tests. Then, a detailed failure analysis is performed by package decapsulation and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive x-ray (SEM/EDX) to confirm the experimental findings. In conclusion, the study finds that for an ultrafine-pitched thermally enhanced BGA package, wire type is insignificant to reduce wire shorting occurrences. However, mold material and copper heat spreader structure using an optimized wire loop design are significant factors in eliminating wiresweep shorting phenomena. This study concludes with a wirebond interconnect and heat slug design recommended along with an improved process parameters and assembly material sets found from the experiment.},

  pages={85-93},
  abstract={It has been observed that different tin whisker growth properties can result from the same tin deposit on two copper leadframe materials, C19400 and C70250. It was also found that modification of the surface condition of identical substrates, through pretreatment prior to Sn-plating, affects whisker growth behavior. Here, we report an atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigation of intermetallic compounds (IMC) formed on samples with significantly different whisker growth tendencies. AFM data analysis in conjunction with the IMC growth rate, determined using the weight gain method, provides quantitative data of the IMC characteristics. It was found that the whisker propensity is not directly related to the uneven growth front of IMC as detected by AFM. Whisker growth tendency, with respect to whisker density and length, decreases when the unevenness of the IMC layer exceeds a certain level. The results of this work show evidence that the whisker propensity is associated with the copper substrate texture as well as the substrate surface topography.},

  abstract={An understanding of the fundamentals of the boiling mechanism is essential if phase-change liquid immersion cooling is to emerge as a cooling option for the next generation of data servers and other high performance electronics. The present work is an experimental study on the effect of cavity mouth size on the nucleation characteristics of a single isolated micro-pyramidal reentrant cavity. Cavity mouth size has long been known to be a primary variable determining the ebullition characteristics of microscopic structures present on a pool boiling heat sink surface. Isolated pyramidal shaped cavities with square mouth sizes of 7, 19, and 25/spl mu/m etched in polished silicon using an anisotropic etch were evaluated in this study. Serpentine thin film heaters (6.9mm /spl times/ 6.9mm) deposited on a Borofloat glass substrate and anodically bonded to the silicon cavity section served as heat sources. All experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure in dielectric fluids, HFE-7100 and FC-72, popular in thermal management applications. High speed photography (up to 600frames/s) was used to record and quantify the effect of heat flux on bubble departure frequency and departure diameter under subcooled and saturated conditions. The bubble departure diameter increased with an increase in the cavity mouth size. Frequency and bubble departure size, both decreased with increased subcooling.},

  abstract={Spatially resolved radiation from a scanning electron microscope can be used to create micro- and nanoscopic hydrogels from poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG] with an approach similar to the electron-beam patterning of polymeric photoresists. We show that the patterned features generated by electron-beam cross-linking swell when exposed to water. The extent of swelling depends on the incident electron dose. Because of the significance of PEG in biomaterials applications, we examined the adsorption of fibronectin and laminin onto the PEG microhydrogels using immunofluorescence optical microscopy. Undetectable levels of protein are observed for low dose patterns. The amount of adsorbed protein increases with the dose and reaches a maximum at the highest doses where swelling is not observed. As part of ongoing research on patterning surfaces to control neurite growth in the context of the inflammatory environment of a spinal cord injury, we are interested in how these gel surfaces interact with macrophages. We show that the number of adhered macrophages can be also controlled by the irradiation conditions. By spatially patterning combinations of low and high swelling gels, we show that macrophage adhesion can be confined to specific locations on the surface.},

  abstract={In this study, a poly (D,L-lactic acid) (PLA) nanodispersion system was designed for targeting and imaging of cancer sites. Nanoparticles between 120 nm and 200 nm would allow delivery into the cancer site specifically via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect Also, by reducing reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake and renal excretion, the nanoparticles would have longer circulation time under physiological conditions with minimal side effects. This advantageous system was prepared by a modified solvent diffusion method. Camphor, which upon removal by sublimation makes the nanoparticles hollow enabling gas introduction, was added to offer echogenicity to the particles. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) results demonstrated that these nanoparticles have approximately 200 nm size with unimodal distribution. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) results showed that the nanoparticles have a spherical shape and supported DLS results. These particles containing Sulfur hexafluoride (SF/sub 6/) gas have shown 7.5 dB enhancements at 5 MHz frequency. Thus, we can conclude that this PLA nanodispersion system has the potential for creating a multifunctional particle acting as a cancer targeting molecule, an ultrasound contrast agent, and further a drug carrier.},

  year={2005},
  volume={},

  pages={237-242},
  abstract={Novel materials for embedded passive applications are in great and urgent demands. High dielectric constant and low dielectric loss are the most important dielectric materials prerequisites for embedded capacitors. It was demonstrated by the authors' that the carbon black (CB)/epoxy composites achieved ultra high K (>13,000). High dielectric loss, however, is the key issue of this material system. In this presentation, a novel method was introduced to control the dielectric loss of dielectric composites by taking advantage of the Coulomb blockade effect, the well-known quantum effect of metal nanoparticles. The increased K value and decreased dissipation factor were observed by the incorporation of in-situ formed Ag nanoparticles. The remarkably increased dielectric constant of the interfacial polarization-based composites is due to the piling of charges at the extended interface. The reduced dielectric loss was observed in the high dielectric constant composite materials containing silver (Ag) nanoparticles in virtue of Coulomb blockade effect. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the microstructure of the Ag/epoxy composites and the Ag/CB/epoxy composites in order to correlate the structure and morphology of the composites with the dielectric properties.},

The amount of SAM coated on Ag nanoparticles was tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphologies of SAM treated Ag nanoparticles before and after the heat treatment. Several kinds of epoxy formulation were prepared by using SAM-treated Ag nanoparticles as conductive fillers and the resistivities were studied.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a combination of mean-shift-based tracking processes to establish migrating cell trajectories through in vitro phase-contrast video microscopy. After a recapitulation on how the mean-shift algorithm permits efficient object tracking we describe the proposed extension and apply it to the in vitro cell tracking problem. In this application, the cells are unmarked (i.e., no fluorescent probe is used) and are observed under classical phase-contrast microscopy. By introducing an adaptive combination of several kernels, we address several problems such as variations in size and shape of the tracked objects (e.g., those occurring in the case of cell membrane extensions), the presence of incomplete (or noncontrasted) object boundaries, partially overlapping objects and object splitting (in the case of cell divisions or mitoses). Comparing the tracking results automatically obtained to those generated manually by a human expert, we tested the stability of the different algorithm parameters and their effects on the tracking results. We also show how the method is resistant to a decrease in image resolution and accidental defocusing (which may occur during long experiments, e.g., dozens of hours). Finally, we applied our methodology on cancer cell tracking and showed that cytochalasin-D significantly inhibits cell motility.},

  abstract={In spite of several modeling approaches to understand the shape memory alloy (SMA) behaviour, many difficulties exist because of the various limitations of the existing free energy models. Associated phase kinetics coupled with the thermoelastodynamics is still not fully tractable. A new dynamic model of 3D SMA is developed in this paper, which employs an improved version of the microscopic Landau theory. Essential properties of the single and multi-variant martensitic phase transformations are recovered using consistent steps, which eliminates the problem of non-uniqueness of energy partitioning and relaxes the over-sensitivity of the free energy due to many unknown material constants in previously reported models. The newly developed microscopic model is incorporate in a variationally formulated finite element framework. Newmark's time integration scheme is adopted and the condition for consistent iteration to solve the strongly nonlinear system at each time step is highlighted. Banded assembly of the discretized system matrix is performed in parallel. A parallel PCG method with Jacobi preconditioner is employed to solve the system at each time step.},

  abstract={Co/sub x/Fe/sub 100-x/ metal/native-oxide multilayer (MNOM) films exhibit soft magnetic properties, large magnetization, high resistivity, and a potential operating bandwidth of several gigahertz. These attractive characteristics are facilitated by ultrathin magnetic native oxide layers introduced to provide a high-resistivity barrier between nanocrystalline metal layers while preserving interlayer coupling and contributing to the net moment. This paper addresses several important features of the MNOM system from a microscopic perspective. The uniaxial anisotropy of MNOM thin films is discussed in detail and "exchange averaging" is invoked to account for its vanishingly small effective dispersion. The role of the native oxide in establishing interlayer exchange coupling is demonstrated, and a detailed account of the nature of the oxide is presented. In the Fe MNOM system, the oxide is shown to have a volume-averaged magnetization of 732(35) emu/cm/sup 3/, with a temperature dependence comparable to that of metallic Fe. The magnetism of this largely "interfacial" oxide is supported by the metal and collapses in the absence of the metal. The oxide retains a large net moment for Co fractions up to at least x=50, but oxide magnetism is lost at high Co fractions, coinciding with the loss of soft magnetic properties.},

After heat treatment, the samples were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS).

The structural and morphological properties of the samples were investigated by X-ray /spl thetav/-2/spl thetav/ Bragg-Brentano, and pole figure diffraction, Nomarsky optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis. The 123 composition was controlled during deposition by means of an atomic absorption system. The optimized buffer layer and YBCO layer are grown at 690/spl deg/C in respectively forming gas and oxygen partial pressures of 5/spl times/10/sup -5/ mbar. These conditions ensure the growth of dense and crack-free layers with good biaxial texture, as indicated by FWHM's values in the 5-7/spl deg/ range for both in- and out-of-plane orientations. Zero-resistance critical temperatures T/sub c/=86-87 K with transition widths /spl Delta/T/sub c/<3 K are reproducibly obtained. End-to-end critical current densities J/sub c/ at 77 K and self-field typically are in the 1.5-2.5 MA/cm/sup 2/ range, as measured by transport measurements.

  abstract={We fabricated cube textured Ni substrates for YBCO coated conductors from the initial specimens prepared by powder metallurgy (P/M) and casting and evaluated the effects of annealing temperature on microstructural evolution and texture formation. To characterize the roles of the two preparation methods, the initial specimens were prepared to be of the same size and experienced the same rolling conditions, and were then annealed in the temperature range of 600/spl deg/C to 1200/spl deg/C. The texture was evaluated by X-ray pole-figure analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The texture analysis indicated that a strong cube texture formed for the substrate made by P/M and this texture did not vary significantly with annealing temperature in the range of 600-1200/spl deg/C. On the other hand, the texture of the substrate made by casting was more dependent on the annealing temperature, and a twin texture ({221}<221>) and several minor texture components began to form at 1000/spl deg/C. Microstructural observation showed that the morphology of deformation band together with micro-band in the as-rolled tape prepared by P/M was more homogeneous and of higher density than that produced by casting, resulting in a strong cube texture in wider range of annealing temperatures and a finer microstructure after recrystallization.},

  abstract={Much effort has been made to develop new metallic buffers to explore the possibility of designing YBCO coated conductors (CC's) with a simple architecture. We selected Au because of its small lattice mismatch to Ni and chemical novelty, and plated it on a biaxially textured Ni substrate by the electroless-plating method. The texture of Au/Ni template was evaluated by X-ray pole-figure and orientation distribution function (ODF) analysis. The surface roughness and grain boundary morphology were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We fabricated the cube textured Au/Ni template for the CC and evaluated its texture formation and microstructural evolution. Texture analysis indicated that the Au layer was epitaxially deposited on the Ni substrate and formed a strong cube texture when the processing variables were optimized. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) was 8.4/spl deg/ for out-of-plane and 9.98/spl deg/ for in-plane texture when the plating time was 30 min. In addition, the root-mean-square (RMS) and the depth of the grain boundary for the Au layer were 14.6 nm and 160 /spl Aring/, respectively, which are significantly smaller than the corresponding values for the Ni substrate (27.0 nm and 800 /spl Aring/), indicating that the electroless-plated Au layer had a relatively smooth surface and effectively mollified grain grooves.},

  abstract={Future applications of high temperature superconductors require bulk materials of a complex shape. The multi-seeded-melt-growth process (MSMG) represents a promising technique for obtaining qualitatively well oriented bulk materials with different kinds of shape. In the MSMG process, several seeds are placed on a precursor pellet, from which the growth of the bulk starts. A certain problem of the MSMG process is that grain boundaries become inevitable when the growth fronts of two neighboring seeds collide. These grain boundaries are responsible for a reduction of the critical currents and pose a problem for high current applications. By polishing the sample step by step, the influence of the grain boundaries was investigated by scanning Hall probe measurements and by the magnetoscan technique. Additionally, optical microscopy and electron microscopy were employed to investigate the details of the microstructure.},

  abstract={Mechanical properties of YBaCuO superconducting tape produced by a multi-stage metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique have been investigated. It is important for YBaCuO superconducting tape to tolerate stress strain and maintain flexibility in order to be used for electric power applications, magnetic applications, and so on. At this time, we have produced an approximately 0.25 /spl mu/m YBaCuO layer on a pulse laser deposition (PLD)-CeO/sub 2//ion beam assisted (IBAD)-Gd/sub 2/Zr/sub 2/O/sub 7//Ni-based alloy substrate by an MOCVD technique, and approximately 4 /spl mu/m Ag was sputtered on it as a protective layer. The thickness of each layer was approximately 1.0 /spl mu/m, 1.0 /spl mu/m and 0.1 mm respectively. Its critical current was about 50 A. The mechanical properties of YBaCuO tape formed on Ni-based alloy substrates with a CeO/sub 2//Gd/sub 2/Zr/sub 2/O/sub 7/ buffer layer will be described. Tensile or compressive bend stress tests were conducted, and normalized critical current and the value n were evaluated. The degradation of its critical current was confirmed not to be in the big problem level in manufacturing applications. In addition, the surfaces of YBaCuO layers were observed by scanning electron microscopy and no crack was observed on them. Next, axial tensile stress tests were conducted and the YBaCuO tape was compared with biaxially textured Ni-3at.%W alloy substrates and YBaCuO layers on Ag substrates. Axial tensile stress characteristics of the YBaCuO tape were confirmed to be much higher than others. The YBaCuO tape was confirmed to have adequate axial tensile stress characteristics for designing a coil which can tolerate electromagnetic force.},

  abstract={The IBAD and RABiTS coated conductors are investigated by variable temperature scanning laser microscopy (VTSLM). In 50 /spl mu/m scanning step images, IBAD samples appear to have more uniform current distribution than RABiTS samples, which can be related to the smaller grain sizes in IBAD. The images of IBAD samples taken with higher resolution reveal feather-like clusters with 40-150 /spl mu/m in diameter. In RABiTS, the shape and size of percolation clusters are clear and do not change between high and low resolution images, and they are estimated to be 50-150 /spl mu/m. VTSLM images prove that the current percolation in the transition region is due to the combination of the grain boundary network and the critical temperature variation. At the temperature below the critical temperature, the images of VTSLM show that the current bottleneck area causes the major local dissipation limiting I/sub c/. We also find that the dissipation areas have lower T/sub c//sup */ and high /spl delta/V/sub m/, an important characteristic shared among all the lower J/sub c//sup */ areas.},

  pages={3718-3721},
  abstract={REBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub y/ (REBCO) is expected to be used in numerous applications, such as power transmission cables, high-field magnets and generators, due to the possibility of a high critical current density at 77 K under a high magnetic field. Biaxially textured REBCO superconducting tapes are developed to obtain high-J/sub c/. However, the J/sub c/-B characteristics of REBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub y/ films have a magnetic field angle dependency. When the magnetic field is applied parallel to the film surface, the reduction in J/sub c/ is not larger under a high magnetic field of 10 T. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the film surface, the reduction in J/sub c/ is significantly large under a magnetic field of more than around 5 T at 77 K. From the viewpoint of realizing wide applications of high-T/sub c/ superconductors, it is important to improve the J/sub c/-B characteristics of REBCO films under magnetic fields higher than 5 T applied perpendicular to the film surface. Our group focuses on artificial pinning centers (APCs) introduced into REBCO films. The J/sub c/-B characteristics of certain films are improved by the introduction of APCs. The microstructures of these films are investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We report on the microstructures of REBCO films with APCs.},

  abstract={Area array packages (AAPs) with 1.27 mm pitch have been the packages of choice for commercial applications; they are now starting to be implemented for use in military and aerospace applications. Thermal cycling characteristics of plastic ball grid array (PBGA) and chip scale package (CSP) assemblies, because of their wide usage for commercial applications, have been extensively reported on in literature. Thermal cycling represents the on-off environmental condition for most electronic products and therefore is a key factor that defines reliability. However, very limited data is available for thermal cycling behavior of ceramic packages commonly used for the aerospace applications. For high reliability applications, numerous area array packages are available with the same design pattern both in ceramic and plastic packages. This paper compares assembly reliability of ceramic and plastic package with the same I/O and pattern. The ceramic package was in the form of CCGA with 560 I/Os peripheral array with the same pad design as its plastic counterpart. The effects of the following key parameters on reliability of both CCGA and PBGA assemblies were investigated. Thermal cycle ranges, -50/75/spl deg/C, -55/100/spl deg/C, and -55/125/spl deg/C; corner staking on failure mechanisms for two thermal cycle profiles, -55/125/spl deg/C and -50/75/spl deg/C; and package interchangeability, i.e. using PBGA package on CGA pad design with a larger pad; heat sink attachment on the top of package. Packages were assembled on polyimide board and their daisy chains were continuously monitored. Optical photomicrographs were taken at various thermal cycle intervals to document damage progress and behavior. Representative samples along with their cross-sectional photomicrographs at higher magnification, taken by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are also presented. These were used to determine crack propagation and failure analyses for packages with and without corner staking.},

  abstract={In this study, thermal cycling test from -40/spl deg/C to 125/spl deg/C with 1 hour per cycle for Sn/sub -3.8/Ag/sub -0.7/Cu solder joint electronic assemblies was conducted for PBGA316, PQFP208, PQFP176, and TSSOP48 components. Two PCB surface finish conditions were investigated for ENIG and OSP. Daisy chain, in-situ resistance monitoring with data logger, was used for failure detection when the resistance value is larger than 300/spl Omega/. A two-parameter Weibull distribution model was used to determine the mean time to failure (MTTF) for different components. The Weibull parameters such as characteristic life and slope are compared for PBGA assembly with Ni/Au and OSP surface finishes. Microscopy was used to determine the crack path and failure mode. It was shown that components with Ni/Au surface finish have higher thermal fatigue life than those with OSP surface finish. PBGA solder joints are more sensitive to thermal fatigue failure than solder joints in PQFP and TSSOP components. More failures occur at the package side than board side for PBGA assembly. Fatigue life prediction was conducted using fatigue life prediction model and FEA analysis results for different component types. Quarter model with submodeling technique was used in FEA simulation due to symmetric geometry and uniform loading for PBGA, PQFP and TSSOP assemblies. Effect of solder joint location on fatigue life was studied based on FEA result for different assemblies. It was shown that test and predicted fatigue life results have a good agreement for different component types.},

  title={Powercycling Reliability, Failure Analysis and Acceleration Factors of Pb-Free Solder Joints}, 
  year={2005},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={907-915},
  abstract={At the present time, life acceleration factors for solder joints made of SnAgCu (SAC) ternary alloys between accelerated tests and field use conditions are not well understood. Further, the cycle time for accelerated testing of Pb-free solders is currently an industry concern since the rate of damage accumulation due to thermomechanical loading in Pb-free solders is different from the eutectic Sn-Pb solders. In this study, we develop an understanding of the acceleration factors through a combination of temperature cycling tests, powercycling tests and validated damage modeling. We begin by describing a recently developed simulated power cycling (SPC) tester that is a simplified powercycling test procedure. The tester uses an external thermoelectric device to heat the package surface. Through localized heating, the thermoelectric device enables rapid cycling of packages unlike in thermal chambers. We report temperature and powercycling reliability data on Pb-free, Sn4Ag0.5Cu36 I/O wafer level-chip scale packages (WL-CSP). We compare the results of powercycling against -40deg to 125deg C temperature cycling test results. In both, fatigue failure by near interfacial crack growth was discovered to progress from the outside edge of the joints towards the center of the package. Creep and shear dominated microscopic failure modes were found on the solder joint fracture surfaces. Further, we observe in both cases that there are no diagonal cracks, secondary cracks are scarce and the effect of voids on crack growth is insignificant compared to the location of the joint on the package, which determines the stress on the joint. The fracture morphology due to fatigue crack growth was nearly identical close to and far from the crack initiation site, revealing similar damage mechanisms during all stages of life. Finally, we propose a procedure for extracting acceleration factors based on a recently developed (and experimentally validated for Sn-Pb solder joints) damage accumulation theory inspired by the cohesive zone models of modern fracture mechanics. The proposed model is non-empirical unlike the Coffin-Manson rule and simulates the actual progression of crack through the joint},

The microstructure changes in the surface layer of copperplate were determined using X-ray diffraction techniques; results showed that the distribution of crystal face in the surface of copperplate was changed after laser irradiation, which affected the surface energy of copperplate. The increase of surface energy reinforced the interfacial reaction and promoted the growth of intermetallics, which, however, was proved to have little impact on the morphology of intermetallics by aging.},

We present an SSFnet-based microscopic simulation of the containment strategy against random scan worms, and explore various performance characteristics of the group defense mechanism. The simulation results help to characterize the conditions and degree to which the integrated quarantine strategy can both slow worm propagation and prevent the worm from reaching its full saturation potential.},

  abstract={The physical and reliability characteristics of strained-Si/sub 0.8/Ge/sub 0.2/ MOS capacitor and strained-Si/sub 0.7/Ge/sub 0.3/ MOSFET with Hf-based gate dielectrics prepared by atomic layer chemical vapor deposition are investigated. The thickness and composition of the gate dielectrics are measured by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The gate leakage current and interface traps of HfO/sub 2//Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ gate structure are slightly higher as compared to the HfO/sub 2//Si MOS devices, which is basically caused by the Ge at the interface. The electrical properties of both HfO/sub 2//Si and HfO/sub 2//Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ devices can be improved with increasing PDA temperature up to 800/spl deg/C, which is due to the thicker interfacial layer grown at the interface, even though crystallization also grows with increasing temperature. However, with higher PDA temperature (>800/spl deg/C), serious crystallization of HfO/sub 2/ film causes more bulk traps induced electrical degradation. The electrical stress induced degradation of Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ substrate is slightly higher as compared to the control Si, due to more traps generations at the HfO/sub 2//Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ interface. For MOSFET, strained-Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ can effectively improve the drain current for about 20% at saturation and 69% at linear region. The higher gate leakage (J/sub g//spl sim/1.4/spl times/10/sup -9/A/cm/sup 2/ at 2 V) and lower breakdown voltage (BD/spl sim/3.1 V) of Si/sub 0.7/Ge/sub 0.3/ pMOS devices are observed as compared to control Si devices (J/sub g//spl sim/7.9/spl times/10/sup -12/A/cm/sup 2/ at 2 V and BD/spl sim/7.4 V). After the electrical stress, the degradation of drain current and transconductance and the shift of threshold voltage for Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ PMOSFET are larger than those for control Si devices, implying Ge induced trap generation at the Hf-silicate/Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ interface.},

Currently, methods exist for tracking rolling leukocytes in vivo, but these methods rely on manual detection of the cells. In this paper we propose a technique for accurately detecting rolling leukocytes based on Bayesian classification. The classification depends on a feature score, the gradient inverse coefficient of variation (GICOV), which serves to discriminate rolling leukocytes from a cluttered environment. The leukocyte detection process consists of three sequential steps: the first step utilizes an ellipse matching algorithm to coarsely identify the leukocytes by finding the ellipses with a locally maximal GICOV. In the second step, starting from each of the ellipses found in the first step, a B-spline snake is evolved to refine the leukocytes boundaries by maximizing the associated GICOV score. The third and final step retains only the extracted contours that have a GICOV score above the analytically determined threshold. Experimental results using 327 rolling leukocytes were compared to those of human experts and currently used methods. The proposed GICOV method achieves 78.6% leukocyte detection accuracy with 13.1% false alarm rate.},

  abstract={The offline coupling of polymer microfluidic chips to mass spectrometry (MS) through electrospray deposition of analyte onto matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) targets for MALDI-MS analysis is presented. Using polycarbonate (PC) microfluidic chips with integrated hydrophobic membrane electrospray tips, selected peptides and proteins were eluted onto a stainless steel MALDI target via electrospray deposition, followed by off-line MALDI-MS analysis. A variety of matrix compositions were evaluated, and the resulting film morphology was studied via scanning electron microscopy. Microchip electrospray deposition is found to yield excellent homogeneity of peptide crystals, and exhibits significantly improved reproducibility during MALDI-MS analysis. Using this approach, a detection limit of 3.5 pmol is demonstrated for angiotensin.},

  abstract={A simple method for fabricating nanoscale channels based on thermomechanical deformation of rigid polymer substrates is described. The process uses thermoplastic preforms containing microchannels with cross-sectional dimensions on the order of tens of microns, which are controllably deformed to produce sub-micron dimensions. Nanochannels with circular or elliptical cross-sections are defined in polycarbonate by varying the channel position and preform geometry prior to deformation. Arrays of parallel nanochannels with critical dimensions down to 400 nm are described. Using the fabrication method, a nanochannel network is fabricated for the detection of single protein molecules via confocal fluorescence microscopy, with channel dimensions matched to the confocal volume dimensions of the detection objective. Single molecule measurements of fluorescently-labeled bovine serum albumin at 15 nM and 150 nM concentrations are presented.},

The nanoparticles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ultraviolet photoluminescence (PL). The SEM micrographs indicated that the particles were spherical in shape with a diameter of /spl sim/160 nm. However, the TEM micrographs revealed the presence of nanoplatelets and rods with a particle-size of /spl sim/2 nm x/spl sim/80 nm. The observed X-ray diffraction pattern was identical to the standard diffraction pattern of ZnO. Ultraviolet photoluminescence (PL) studies of the samples showed a strong PL intensity and a significant blue shift relative to the PL of the bulk. Shifts up to 70 meV were observed and attributed to a quantum confinement effect. Electrical measurements indicated a highly resistive nature of the nanoparticulate material.},

  abstract={We used newly developed scanning magnetoresistance microscopy (SMRM) to observe time-lapsed magnetic domain images during magnetic switching in square Permalloy dots. Unlike magnetic force microscopy, the SMRM images measure the absolute local magnetic field from any microstructure. SMRM works in an external magnetic field, allowing the measurement of evolution of quasi-static domain structures. We observed a complete magnetic reversal in 5 /spl mu/m Permalloy dots from a positively saturated state to a negatively saturated state via a mixture of flux-closure states. We also observed field-driven transitions between the various flux closure states at low fields. There appears to be a distribution of switching field and mode, even for geometrically identical dots. This work demonstrates the novel capability of the SMRM technique and the rich switching physics of magnetic square dots.},

  abstract={The gene activities in T lymphocytes that regulate immune responses are influenced by Ca/sup 2+/ ([Ca/sup 2+/]/sub i/). The intracellular calcium signals are highly heterogeneous and vitally important in determining the immune outcome. The signals in individual cells can be measured using fluorescence microscopy but to group the cells into classes with similar signal kinetics is currently laborious. Here, we demonstrate a method for the automated classification of the responses into four categories formerly identified by an expert's inspection. This method comprises characterising the response by a second-order model, performing frequency analysis, and using derived features as inputs to two multilayer perceptron neural networks (NNs). We compare the algorithm's performance on an example data set against the human classification: it was found to classify identically more than 70% of the data, despite small sample sizes in two categories and significant overlap between the other two classes. The group characterized by an oscillating signal showed the presence of a number of frequencies, which may be important in determining gene activation. A classification threshold enables the automatic identification of patterns with a low-classification certainty. Future refinement of the algorithm may allow the identification of more classes, which may be important in different immune responses associated with disease.},

  abstract={Relevance feedback (RF) has been an active research area in content-based image retrieval (CBIR). RF intends to bridge the gap between the low-level image features and the high-level human visual perception by analyzing and employing the feedback information provided by the user. This gap becomes more evident and important in medical image retrieval due to the two distinct facts with regard to medical images: (1) subtle differences between images, even between pathological and non-pathological images; (2) subjective and different diagnosis even among experts. This paper describes a novel linear weight-updating approach for RF applying to spine X-ray image retrieval. The algorithm utilizes both positive and negative examples to gain feedback from the user. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can substantially improve the retrieval performance to better satisfy the individual user's preferences.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Over the past few years, the popularity of the Internet has been growing by leaps and bounds. However, there comes a time in the life of a technology, as it matures, where questions about its future need to be answered. The Internet is no exception to this case. Often called the "next big thing" in global Internet technology, grid computing is viewed as one of the top candidates that can shape the future of the Internet. Grid computing takes collective advantage of the vast improvements in microprocessor speeds, optical communications, raw storage capacity, World Wide Web and the Internet that have occurred over the last five years. Grid technology leverages existing resources and delays the need to purchase new infrastructure. With demand for computer power in industries like the life sciences and health informatics almost unlimited, grids ability to deliver greater power at less cost gives the technology tremendous potential. Ultimately, the grid must be evaluated in terms of the applications, business value, and scientific results that it delivers, not its architecture. Biology provides some of the most important, as well as most complex, scientific challenges of our times. These problems include understanding the human genome, discovering the structure and functions of the proteins that the genes encode, and using this information efficiently for drug design. Most of these problems are extremely intensive from a computational perspective. One of the principal design goals for the grid framework is the effective logical separation of the complexities of programming a massively parallel machine from the complexities of bioinformatics computations through the definition of appropriate interfaces. Encapsulation of the semantics of the bioinformatics computations methodologies means that the application can track the evolution of the machine architecture and explorations of various parallel decomposition schemes can take place with minimal intervention from the domain experts or the end users. For example, understanding the physical basis of protein function is a central objective of molecular biology. Proteins function through internal motion and interaction with their environment. An understanding of protein motion at the atomic level has been pursued since the earliest simulations of their dynamics. When simulations can connect to experimental results, the microscopic examinations of the different processes (via simulation) acquire more credibility and the simulation results can then help interpret the experimental data. Improvements in computational power and simulation methods facilitated by the grid framework could to lead to important progress in studies of protein structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics. This talk reviews the state of play and shows how grid technology can change the competitive landscape.},

  abstract={Transformer wax (x-wax) formation in dielectric oil under electric stress is demonstrated in the laboratory scale. The x-wax is found to be insoluble and influences the oil-impedance characteristics significantly. The variation of oil-impedance as a function of electric stress exposure time revealed a unique transition in the oil-impedance. Initially, the impedance decreases with electric stress exposure time and at a threshold time the impedance increases. The transition point of impedance is attributed to the x-wax formation. These results are substantiated with the FTIR and microscopic analysis of the oil samples. The effect of temperature and moisture on the x-wax formation is studied. Besides, the study is extended to understand the role of copper and uncured resin on x-wax formation. The temperature is found to have more influence on the x-wax formation compared to moisture, copper and uncured resins.},

  abstract={Sintered rare-earth permanent magnets (for example, Sm/sub 2/Co/sub 17/, SmCo/sub 5/, and Nd/sub 2/Fe/sub 14/B magnets) are quite brittle and easily crack in the course of fabrication, machining, and application. Here, we report on an investigation of fracture behavior and mechanical characteristics of sintered rare-earth permanent magnets and discuss the origin of rare-earth magnet brittleness. We studied three groups of bending specimens with different orientations, cut from the same block of magnet. The bending strength was measured. The fracture surfaces were carefully observed by scanning electron microscopy and showed that the fracture behavior and bending strength of sintered rare-earth permanent magnets obviously exhibit anisotropy. Sintered Sm-Co magnets tend to cleavage fracture in the close-packed (0001) plane or in the (1011) plane. The fracture mechanism of sintered Nd/sub 2/Fe/sub 14/B magnet appears to be mainly intergranular fracture. Our analysis indicates that the anisotropy of fracture behavior and mechanical strength of sintered rare-earth magnets is caused by the strong crystal-structure anisotropy and grain texture created by magnetic field alignment during the fabrication process.},

  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={413-420},
  abstract={This paper presents a new package design for multichip modules. The developed package has a flip-chip-on-chip structure. Four chips [simulating dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips for demonstration purpose] are assembled on a silicon chip carrier with eutectic solder joints. The I/Os of the four chips are fanned-in on the silicon chip carrier to form an area array with larger solder balls. A through-silicon via (TSV) hole is made at the center of the silicon chip carrier for optional underfill dispensing. The whole multichip module is mounted on the printed circuit board by the standard surface mount reflow process. After the board level assembly and X-ray inspection, the underfill process is applied to some selected specimens for comparative study purpose. The underfill material is dispensed through the center TSV hole on the silicon chip carrier to encapsulate the solder joints and the four smaller chips. Subsequently, scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) is performed to inspect the quality of underfill. After the board-level assembly, all specimens are subject to the accelerated temperature cycling (ATC) test. During the ATC test, the electrical resistance of all specimens is monitored. The experimental results show that the packages without underfill encapsulation may fail in less than 100 thermal cycles while those with underfill can last for more than 1200 cycles. From the dye ink analysis and the cross-section inspection, it is identified that the packages without underfill have failure in the silicon chip carrier, instead of solder joints. The features and merits of the present package design are discussed in details in this paper.},

  abstract={Sodium is known to enhance p-type doping in copper indium diselenide (CIS)-based devices fabricated on soda-lime glass substrates, and similar amounts of Na are present in commercial cadmium telluride (CdTe) devices. We present the results on the effects of Na incorporation on the properties of CdTe/CdS solar cells prepared on borosilicate glass substrates. A NaF layer 10 to 30 nm thick was incorporated at either the CdS/CdTe interface or on the CdTe surface, as a source of Na. CdTe layers were deposited by close-spaced sublimation at substrate temperatures from 425/spl deg/C (LT) to 620/spl deg/C (HT), followed by heat-treatment in the presence of CdCl/sub 2/ vapor. Atomic force microscopy analysis showed that the samples with NaF at the CdS/CdTe interface deposited in He ambient have larger grains with a sub-grain structure that disappears after CdCl/sub 2/ heat treatment accompanied by an increase in grain size. Samples deposited in O/sub 2/ ambient have smaller grains without a sub-grain structure. For samples with NaF deposited on the CdTe surface, LT samples with CdCl/sub 2/ heat treatment showed a morphology similar to samples without NaF layers; but samples heat-treated in He ambient at 500/spl deg/C prior to CdCl/sub 2/ treatment showed a different microstructure with platelets on the surface. HT samples with a NaF layer at the CdTe surface showed an additional layer at the surface with both types of heat treatments, indicating that NaF does not react readily for these samples. In addition to the discussion of the effect of Na incorporation on the material properties, we will include preliminary data on the effect of Na incorporation at the interface or surface on device properties.},

  abstract={To study the issues of film growth at low substrate temperature, Cu(In,Ga)Se/sub 2/ (CIGS) films have been deposited at substrate temperatures of 350/spl deg/C under variation of the selenium effusion rate. The properties of the resulting thin films were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Solar cells were fabricated from selected films and characterized by current-voltage and quantum efficiency measurements. While the medium-and high-Se flux samples showed only subtle differences in composition, structure, morphology and device performance, the low-Se samples exhibited very low Cu content, additional chalcopyrite phases, very small grain size, and poor solar cell performance. A minimum selenium/metal flux ratio of 3 is suggested for the low-temperature CIGS deposition process. Higher selenium rates yield modest improvements to solar cell performance at low substrate temperature. The highest cell efficiency, 7.8% at AM1.5 global light, was achieved with a selenium/metal flux ratio of 8.},

  abstract={Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are used in thin film silicon (Si:H) photovoltaics (PV) technology as top electrical contacts and as the components of back-reflecting structures. TCOs are often prepared with macroscopically rough interfaces and/or surfaces (i.e., with "texture") in order to scatter light and thereby enhance optical path lengths in the active layers of the device. Optical analysis of textured TCOs is a considerable challenge, due to the existence of surface roughness and non-uniformity over more than six orders of magnitude in the lateral scale L, from tenths of nanometers to hundreds of microns or more. In this research, we have developed the optical technique of multichannel Mueller matrix ellipsometry to extract the optical properties (/spl epsi//sub 1/, /spl epsi//sub 2/) of textured TCO films as well as the time evolution of surface roughness layer thicknesses on microscopic, macroscopic, and "geometrical optic" lateral scales during the TCO fabrication process.},

The E/sub 1/, E/sub 1/ + /spl Delta//sub 1/, and E/sub 2/ critical-point structures were clearly observed in the SE data for as-deposited samples. The variation of the pseudodielectric function for as-deposited samples was observed under different surface preparation and measurement conditions by in situ SE. The AFM images of the corresponding as-deposited samples revealed variations in surface morphology that were consistent with the SE results. For chloride treated samples, the pseudodielectric function was much different from that of as-deposited samples. This difference was due not only to oxidation of the surface, but also to a disruptive change of the bulk film under such annealing conditions.},

Graded functional ceramic and cermet layers, which are particularly important in porous anode-electrolyte assemblies in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), could also be processed in one step using the freeze-drying approach. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study pore formation mechanisms and pore geometry. It could be shown, that the mechanism, which drives pore formation in directional freeze-drying, may result from convective motion of the water-based ceramic slurry at the onset of freezing},

  title={Nonlinear microscopic fluctuators in Ru-based thick film resistors}, 
  year={2005},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={378-383},
  abstract={The paper concerns low-frequency noise of RuO2+glass thick film resistors. Recent experiments performed in liquid helium temperatures indicate that at large bias the noise become nonlinear, that is its power spectral density SVex does not scale with voltage V like V2. In the paper efforts were undertaken to explain this behavior. Data are analyzed in terms of self heating of the resistors by the driving current. It is demonstrated that normalized noise powers SVex/V2, measured at the same electron temperature but various voltages, are different. We conclude that the normalized noise is voltage dependent i.e. nonlinear. The second argument comes from room temperature measurements. Resistors excited by sine waves of various amplitudes and frequencies exhibit both 1/Deltaf and 1/f noises. Arguments are supplied that this is a fingerprint of nonlinear microscopic conduction mechanism, which means the local current (i) is nonlinear function of local voltage (v). General conclusion is that microscopic noise sources responsible for low-frequency noise in RuO2+glass resistors are nonlinear, that is they have nonlinear i(v) and Sv(v2) dependencies. At room temperature the number of active fluctuators is large. Local voltages take on small values and the overall noise SVex is linear i.e. ~ V2. Nonlinear, asymmetric i(v) curves under ac bias induce a net small DC current and as a result the "ac-induced" 1/f noise. At liquid helium temperatures many fluctuators are frozen. Local voltages take on large values and the overall noise SVex probes the whole microscopic (nonlinear) S v(v2) characteristics},

  year={2005},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={313-318},
  abstract={The market constantly demands an extension of the functional features of electronic devices and this leads to the application of new materials. Polymers represent an innovative potential due to their favorable properties for packing. The MID technology represents a new growing potential in packaging. Basis of this technology are polymer/metal bonds. For the quality and reliability of a polymer/metal bond the adhesive strength is a critical factor. For the adhesion improvement the plasma treatment of polymer surface wins a key position. Reactions between plasma species and polymer surface make it possible to form polar groups on the polymer surface. Polar chemical groups like C-OH, C=O, CHO, COOH are chemically reactive and cause an increase of the surface energy and wetting qualities. The adhesive strength of a polymer/metal bond can be positively affected by exposing to plasma treatment before metallization. Starting from the definition of adhesion investigations were undertaken to characterize the energetic and topological behavior of the polymer surfaces. Methods used were the contact angle method, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and auto focus laser scanning. The verification of the chemical surface change reached by the plasma treatment was accomplished with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). There are well known a large number of destructive testing methods to determine adhesive strength. In this work the examination of the bond strength of the vapor deposited metal layer on the polymer surface was carried out by tape tests on the basis of cross hatch cut procedure},

  abstract={Electron tomography allows for the determination of the three-dimensional structures of cells and tissues at resolutions significantly higher than that which is possible with optical microscopy. Electron tomograms contain, in principle, vast amounts of information on the locations and architectures of large numbers of subcellular assemblies and organelles. The development of reliable quantitative approaches for the analysis of features in tomograms is an important problem, and a challenging prospect due to the low signal-to-noise ratios that are inherent to biological electron microscopic images. This is, in part, a consequence of the tremendous complexity of biological specimens. We report on a new method for the automated segmentation of HIV particles and selected cellular compartments in electron tomograms recorded from fixed, plastic-embedded sections derived from HIV-infected human macrophages. Individual features in the tomogram are segmented using a novel robust algorithm that finds their boundaries as global minimal surfaces in a metric space defined by image features. The optimization is carried out in a transformed spherical domain with the center an interior point of the particle of interest, providing a proper setting for the fast and accurate minimization of the segmentation energy. This method provides tools for the semi-automated detection and statistical evaluation of HIV particles at different stages of assembly in the cells and presents opportunities for correlation with biochemical markers of HIV infection. The segmentation algorithm developed here forms the basis of the automated analysis of electron tomograms and will be especially useful given the rapid increases in the rate of data acquisition. It could also enable studies of much larger data sets, such as those which might be obtained from the tomographic analysis of HIV-infected cells from studies of large populations.},

  abstract={Cell migrations and deformations play essential roles in biological processes, such as parasite invasion, immune response, embryonic development, and cancer. We describe a fully automatic segmentation and tracking method designed to enable quantitative analyses of cellular shape and motion from dynamic three-dimensional microscopy data. The method uses multiple active surfaces with or without edges, coupled by a penalty for overlaps, and a volume conservation constraint that improves outlining of cell/cell boundaries. Its main advantages are robustness to low signal-to-noise ratios and the ability to handle multiple cells that may touch, divide, enter, or leave the observation volume. We give quantitative validation results based on synthetic images and show two examples of applications to real biological data.},

  abstract={A semi-transparent metallic film and a high optical absorbing film were constructed with stacking metallic films. Both films were used as cathodes for polymeric light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). The semi-transparent film was made of gold/aluminum/gold thin multilayers with its optical transparency of the device reaches as high as /spl sim/70% in the visible region without capping layer, and the electrical sheet resistance reduces below 10 /spl Omega//square. During illumination of the PLED, there was approximately 47% of light emitting from the top of the cathode surface, and 53% of light from the ITO side. The high optical absorbing film, also refer to as the black cathode, was constructed with four alternating layers of aluminum-silver, each aluminum or silver layer is 4 nm thick. The PLED with this black cathode demonstrated 126% enhancement of contrast under 1000 lx ambient illumination. The physical properties of these two cathodes were characterized by current-voltage measurement and atomic force microscopy. Ultraviolet-visible transmission spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy were also used to characterize the semi-transparent cathode and the black cathode respectively. For polymer light-emitting device, it is believed that morphology modification at each interface of the cathode plays a crucial role in determining the optical properties and conductivity of the over cathode.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a piecewise nonlinear model for the first time to understand the impact dynamics of micro-oscillator applications including MEMS switches and tapping-mode atomic-force-microscopy (AFM). Specifically, we consider the case when the deformation is large and the tapping happens in the nonlinear frequency response region. In-plane switches and cantilevers with out-of-plane motion, made from single crystal silicon with simple geometry are used for modeling and testing. Both softening and hardening effects are considered. A laser-scanning-vibrometer system is used for quantifying motion. Numerical analysis shows that the nonlinearity not only shifts the bifurcation area, but also changes the bandwidth of the tapping event. The comparison between the experimental results and the simulation results demonstrates the validity of the piecewise nonlinear model we propose.},

It was found that the suspension obtained was stable for more than two weeks, and the stability was related to the concentration of the polymer therein. In comparison with a toluene solution of PAT18, the colloidal suspension shows a considerable red-shift in the optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, as well as a quenched photoluminescence, indicating the solidification of PAT18 in the suspension. The electrophoretic deposition of a PAT18 film from the colloidal suspension was successfully carried out. The film shows almost the same optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra as those of a spin-coated film.

  number={9},
  pages={1804-1814},
  abstract={With scaling of device dimensions, microscopic variations in number and location of dopant atoms in the channel region of the device induce increasingly limiting electrical deviations in device characteristics such as threshold voltage. These atomic-level intrinsic fluctuations cannot be eliminated by external control of the manufacturing process and are most pronounced in minimum-geometry transistors commonly used in area-constrained circuits such as SRAM cells. Consequently, a large number of cells in a memory are expected to be faulty due to process variations in sub-50-nm technologies. This paper analyzes SRAM cell failures under process variation and proposes new variation-aware cache architecture suitable for high performance applications. The proposed architecture adaptively resizes the cache to avoid faulty cells, thereby improving yield. This scheme is transparent to processor architecture and has negligible energy and area overhead. Experimental results on a 32 K direct map L1 cache show that the proposed architecture can achieve 93% yield compared to its original 33%. The Simplescalar simulation shows that designing the data and instruction cache using the proposed architecture results in 1.5% and 5.7% average CPU performance loss (over SPEC 2000 benchmarks), respectively, for the chips with maximum number of faulty cells which can be tolerated by our proposed scheme.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={179-186},
  abstract={In this paper, we have proposed a method for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) grading, using a three-dimensional (3D) quantitative analysis of cell nuclei based on digital image cytometry. We acquired volumetric RCC data for each grade using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and developed a method for grading RCC using 3D visualization and quantitative analysis of cell nuclei. First, we used a method of segmenting cell nuclei based on Pun's method. Second, to determine quantitative features, we used a 3D labeling method based on slice information. After applying the labeling algorithm, we determined the measurements of cell nuclei using 3D quantitative analysis. To evaluate which of the quantitative features provided by 3D analysis could contribute to diagnostic information and could increase accuracy in nuclear grading, we analyzed statistical differences in 3D features among the grades. We compared features measured in two dimensions (diameter, area, perimeter, and circularity) with features measured in three dimensions (volume, surface area, and spherical shape factor) between identical cell nuclei by using regression analysis. For 3D visualization, we used a contour-based method for surface rendering. We found a statistically significant correlation between the nuclear grade and the 3D morphological features. Comparing our results to an ideal RCC grading system, we found that our nuclear grading system based on the 3D features of a cell nucleus provides distinct dividing points between grades and also provides data that can be easily interpreted for diagnoses. 3D visualization of cell nuclei offers a realistic display and additional valuable medical information that can lead to an objective diagnosis. This method could overcome the limitations inherent in 2D analysis and could improve the accuracy and reproducibility of quantification of cell nuclei. Our study showed that a nuclear grading system based on the 3D features of a cell nucleus might be an ideal grading system.},

  abstract={In this paper, we have proposed a region-position 3D labeling algorithm for a three dimension analysis of cells in a histological tissue. A cell in a tissue section contains much information about diseases. This information is very important in the diagnosis and the treatment of diseases. However, we can find a seriously problem during to get the information of cell analysis based on a two-dimensional image. This problem can lead to removing artifacts the size or the diameter of depending on the angle of the physical sectioning etc. And it is difficult to get the correct analysis because we don't know the three-dimensional shape of cells. Therefore, we need to the three-dimensional data of cells. From these volumetric data some three-dimensional features could be quantified. And three-dimensional visualization could be created. It is a method that purposed a 3D labeling which consists of several steps as follows. The first step is a detecting the region-position of all objects in a two-dimensional image. Secondly, the 3D object creates to the amount of object numbers in a slice. Thirdly, an interconnection makes by using region-position of before and after object in the two-dimensional images. Finally, if it has been interconnected the object creates a new 3D object. In the proposed a 3D labeling algorithm could be reduced the time-complexity and we believe that our method could become a useful method of 3D labeling.},

  abstract={The biologically-inspired swarm paradigm is being used to design self-organizing systems of locally interacting artificial agents. A major difficulty in designing swarms with desired characteristics is understanding the causal relation between individual agent and collective behaviors. Mathematical analysis of swarm dynamics can address this difficulty to gain insight into system design. This paper proposes a framework for mathematical modeling of swarms of microscopic robots that may one day be useful in medical applications. While such devices do not yet exist, the modeling approach can be helpful in identifying various design trade-offs for the robots and be a useful guide for their eventual fabrication. Specifically, we examine microscopic robots that reside in a fluid, for example, a bloodstream, and are able to detect and respond to different chemicals. We present the general mathematical model of a scenario in which robots locate a chemical source. We solve the scenario in one-dimension and show how results can be used to evaluate certain design decisions.},

  abstract={Much attention has been given to sub-1G/sub 0/ (=2e/sup 2//h) features in the transmission curve of a quantum point contact (e.g.: 0.5G/sub 0/, 0.7G/sub 0/). Explanations for this phenomenon have been attributed to many-body interactions such as the Kondo effect or the formation of spin polarized currents. We have used scanning gate microscopy to directly observe the local features of the transport associated with sub-1G/sub 0/ structures. Images taken with this technique reveal striking features such as weak localization induced within the constriction as well as the formation of self-consistent potentials in the QPC.},

The measured tunneling current in the case of PMNBT SAM is much higher than that in the case of dodecanemonothiolate (DDMT) molecules. Furthermore, the PMNBT SAMs appear to exhibit a pronounced rectification of the tunneling current not observed in the case of DDMT. Possible reasons for the difference between the I-V characteristics of the two molecules are identified.},

  abstract={A nanocomposite film of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with Nafion/spl trade/ is prepared by cast deposition on glassy carbon electrodes (GCE). The morphologies of the MWNTs and MWNTs/Nafion/spl trade/ modified electrode are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The MWNTs are cylindrically shaped and uniform with a diameter in the range of 40 - 60 nm. The MWNTs/Nafion/spl trade/ composite film is cast homogeneously onto GCE. Well-defined voltammetric responses are observed for the Fe(CN)/sub 6//sup 4-//Fe(CN)/sub 6//sup 3-/ redox system in aqueous 0.1 M KCl on the MWNTs/Nafion/spl trade/ modified electrode. The anodic stripping response for Cd metal from a solution of 1 to 4 /spl mu/M in aqueous 0.1 M acetate buffer solution is demonstrated. The amounts of hydrogen peroxide and the heights of amperometric response of this sensor vary proportionately. The results indicate that the electroanalytical nanocomposite film composed of MWNTs and Nafion/spl trade/ is highly sensitive and suitable for potential electrochemical sensor applications.},

  abstract={This research aims at characterizing and predicting the mechanical behavior of thin film materials that are used in micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS). Micro machined bilayer cantilevers of various dimensions were fabricated and analyzed to extract models. The models designed in this process are foreseen to be an essential tool for MEMS designers as they would relate the loading parameters, material properties and geometry of the microstructures with its performance characteristics. A computational methodology based on empirical modeling was developed that enables the designer to prototype the designs before fabrication. The proposed model generates accurate material properties applicable at the microscopic level, thereby accelerating the design and development process. The performance of the proposed model was compared to the experimental values and the results were found to be very encouraging.},

  title={A stress-life methodology for ball grid array lead-free and tin-lead solder interconnects under impact conditions}, 
  year={2005},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={277-284},
  abstract={Portable electronic products are often subject to impact or shock during use which leads to failures of the external housing, internal electronic components, package-to-board interconnects, and liquid crystal display panels. Moreover, the introduction of lead-free solder to the electronics industry will bring additional design implications for future generations of mobile information and communication technology (ICT) applications. In this paper, drop tests performed on printed circuit boards (PCBs) populated with ball grid arrays (BGAs) are reported. During testing, measurements from strain gauges were recorded using a high-speed data acquisition system. Electrical continuity through each package was monitored during the impact events in order to detect failure of package-to-board interconnects. Life distributions were established for both a lead-free and a tin-lead solder for various drop heights. The explicit finite element method (FEM) was employed to approximate the peel stress at the critical solder joint and a stress-life model was then established for both solders. Finally, failure analysis was carried out using microsection techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). It was found that, for board level drop testing, different failure mechanisms can occur for different drop heights and that there is a considerable difference between the lead-free solder characteristic life and the tin-lead solder characteristic life.},

  abstract={We perform a microscopic analysis of the degradation originated by the kink effect in the dynamic and noise performance of short-channel InAlAs/InGaAs lattice matched HEMTs by using a 2D ensemble Monte Carlo simulator. The onset of kink effect leads to a significant increase of the drain conductance, whose frequency dependence reflects the influence of the processes at the origin of the kink effect. Concerning the noise performance, the kink effect provokes an enhancement in the drain- and gate-current noise at low frequency, with a characteristic cutoff frequency related to the impact ionization rate and hole recombination time.},

  abstract={We present a microscopic analysis of current fluctuations in a GaAs n/sup +/-n-metal Schottky barrier diode containing electron traps in the active layer. An ensemble Monte Carlo simulation is used for the calculations. We analyze the influence of generation-recombination mechanisms of electrons with traps on the current-voltage characteristics and noise spectra of the diode. The presence of traps reduces both the flat-band voltage and the current level in the series-resistance regime. With respect to the noise, significant modifications are observed in the current noise spectra. In the barrier-limited regime, while at low frequency shot noise is not found to change, the returning-carriers peak is strongly modulated by the influence of the traps. Beyond flat-band conditions generation-recombination noise becomes evident at low frequency, exhibiting a quadratic dependence on the current.},
