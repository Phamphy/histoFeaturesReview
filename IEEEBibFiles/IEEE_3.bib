  abstract={Fluctuation enhanced sensing (FES) is newly coined term for a highly sensitive and selective stochastic fingerprinting technique for chemical and biological sensing. FES deals with the characterization and discrimination of sensed analytes using the microscopic fluctuations of the sensor signal around the mean value. The paper demonstrates a low cost, low power CMOS implementation of a front-end for fluctuation enhanced sensing in a TSMC 0.18/spl mu/ CMOS technology. It consists of a transimpedance amplifier and low pass filter array with 8 distinct cut-off frequencies acting as a coarse on-chip spectrum analyzer for feature extraction within individual frequency band. The gain of the front-end circuit is at least 87dB with a total power consumption of just 1.1mW. The equivalent input current noise level is under 7nA/sub RMS/.},

  abstract={Histology is the science of understanding the structure of animals and plants, and studying the functional implications of biological structures. In this paper, we propose a statistical modeling approach to human histological image categorization. Texture features of the images are characterized by localized Gabor filters. The probabilistic distribution of the texture patterns from each category is approximated by a finite Gaussian mixture model. Expectation maximization (EM) procedure and minimum message length (MML) principle are used to perform density estimation and model selection, respectively. Component-wise EM and weak component annihilation are applied to avoid the drawbacks of the standard EM. Experimental validation is provided based on images from different organs and parts of the body.},

  abstract={Cellular polymer films are suitable for electret and piezoelectric applications. Considerable attention is currently focused on thermoplastic polymer foams such as isotactic polypropylene (i-PP). The cellular morphology leads to barrier effects effectively improving the charge storage stability. However, the application of neat cellular polypropylene electrets is limited due to their relatively low working temperature. Therefore, new research activities are mainly focused on processing of cellular high temperature polymers such as polyetherimide (PEI). A promising approach is a physical batch foaming process using carbon dioxide as a blowing agent, which allows the manufacturing of thin cellular films. The control of the cellular morphology plays an important role with respect to the charge storage behavior and is influenced by the processing parameters such as blowing agent concentration or foaming temperature. Investigations of the cellular morphologies are achieved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electret properties are characterised by potential decay measurements at 90/spl deg/C after corona charging to surface potentials of about 400 V. In general, such cellular films show improved charge storage behavior in comparison to the compact materials.},

  pages={270-272},
  abstract={Blending is a promising approach, in the conducting polymer field, for taking advantage of the good mechanical properties and processability of conventional polymers. The challenge of producing blends with conducting polymer has been studied by many researchers in the last years. In this work, flexible and conducting films were obtained by casting poly(p-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) and doped polyaniline (PADB) mixtures from N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solutions. Freestanding films of blends were obtained by casting, which were characterized by conductivity measurements, optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The conducting PADB/PHS blends, prepared from NMP, showed values of normalized conductivity from 10/sup -7/ to 10/sup -6/ S/cm for the compositions from 30 to 100 wt% of PADB. Compared to blends prepared from DMF solution, a reduction in the conductivity was observed for the present blends, prepared from NMP, for instance, the 50/50 PADB/PHS blends has shown conductivities of 10/sup -3/ S/cm and 10/sup -7/ S/cm, respectively. Morphology studies showed no separation of phases up to 70 wt% of PADB by OM and a homogeneous surface film by SEM, for the PADB/PHS 70/30 prepared from NMP solution. On the other hand, the PADB/PHS blends prepared from DMF solution showed the presence of aggregates, which could be observed using an OM and a fibrilar morphology by SEM. Conductivity represented a balance between PADB content and morphology of polymer blends.},

  abstract={Adsorbed layers of poly(o-ethoxyaniline) (POEA) produced with the layer-by-layer technique have been studied with atomic force spectroscopy (AFS). The films were prepared under different conditions (pH and solution concentration), and measurements were carried out in air and in a liquid cell. Both the doping level and fabrication conditions affect the POEA film morphology and the interactions of the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip with the polymer molecules. For example, a mapping of the forces indicates the presence of conducting islands surrounded by a less conductive matrix in POEA and PANI films, with the conducting islands being characterized by the presence of double-layer forces. The conducting islands are further visualized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pictures. At pH 5, POEA appears completely dedoped where PANI can preserve some of its conducting character, and this is confirmed in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements.},

  abstract={An organic chemical accelerant was added into the mixed solution during the in situ polymerization process of conductive polymer 3,4-polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT). The conductivity change of PEDOT films was measured by four-probe technique. Morphology images of films were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The experimental results showed that higher conductivity PEDOT films (about 120S/cm) was obtained after molar ratio of 0.05-0.15% accelerant was added into solution and high quality PEDOT films was obtained. We suggested that the accelerant changed polymerization speed of PEDOT and longer conjugated chain was formed and PEDOT films had better orientation. Furthermore, the decomposition temperature of PEDOT was influenced by accelerant. About 40 /spl deg/C change of decomposition temperature was observed by thermogravimetry (TG). The explanation of advantage of lower decomposition temperature of PEDOT was also included in this paper.},

  abstract={To integrate future 3D electronic circuits that contain vertical interconnects, the cross sectional profile of each connecting via must be precisely known. Through silicon vias (TSVs) are one approach to vertical interconnects and the subject of this paper. To investigate these vias, a small wafer sample is mechanically polished and viewed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The vias that were formed in this research were 4-8 /spl mu/m in diameter and 20-30 /spl mu/m deep. To analyze the characteristics of the vias, the average surface variation on the edge of polished samples needs to be 100 nanometers or less. In this research, it was found that an average surface variation of less than 10 nm can be achieved within 45 minutes of polishing by utilizing a specially designed sample holder. This polishing procedure offers benefits over other sample preparation procedures such as epoxy potting and polishing because this new method is reproducible, reliable and beneficial to overall sample analysis.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel method to prepare inorganic superhydrophobic silica coatings for microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) packaging using sol-gel processing with tetramethoxysilane and isobutyl-trimethoxysilane as precursors. Incorporation of isobutyl-trimethoxysilane into silica causes hydrophobic isobutyl groups to be present on the surface, thus generating surface hydrophobicity. The particle size and porosity and therefore the surface structure can be controlled by pH, solvent evaporation rate, and precursor ratio. Goniometer measurements of silica films on glass slides indicated that these films displayed a contact angle of 170deg. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the surface morphology and structure and the results discussed with respect to the effect of surface roughness on superhydrophobicity. Electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were conducted to characterize the silica film composition. Improved UV stability was achieved compared to organic polymers such as fluorinated polybutadiene. FTIR was used to investigate the long term degradation of the superhydrophobic silica surfaces},

  abstract={For carbon nanotubes to be used for electronic application, nanotubes would need to achieve high interfacial adhesion with metal. In this paper, chemical vapor deposited carbon nanotubes have been successfully coated with nickel by electroless plating method. Ni plates were used as substrates as well as catalyst provider for the growth of carbon nanotubes. Without dispersing the grown nanotubes from their substrate, electroless plating process was performed directly on the as-grown carbon nanotubes. In order to improve nanotubes wettability to Ni, nanotubes were immerged in solution of SnCl2/HCl for sensitization and soaking in solution of PdCl2/HCl for activation. Upon completing the pretreatment processes, the nanotube films were electroless plated with Ni by dipping into plating solution of NiSO4.6H2O/NaH2PO2.2H2 O/sodium eleconate/NH4Cl for 5, 10, 15 or 20 mins. The morphology and cross section of the electroless plated nanotubes films were observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that uniform layer of Ni was coated on all nanotubes and the thickness of that Ni layer increased proportionally with plating time},

  number={},
  pages={6 pp.-},
  abstract={Recently, research and industrial interest in underfill materials in electronics packaging has increased, especially in flip chip in package (FCIP) and wafer-level packaging (WLP). Underfill materials, typically comprising an epoxy resin matrix with silica particles, are required to improve packaging reliability in chip-level devices by reducing stress due to differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between interfacial materials such as metal bumps and the substrates. The advent of flip-chip packaging has necessitated higher thermal and mechanical performance from underfill encapsulates. In this paper, several underfill materials from different suppliers are characterized in terms of their curing behaviors, kinetics, thermal stability, and thermo-oxidative stability using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) techniques. Mechanical properties were also characterized using the shear test method. The morphologies of fracture surfaces of the test specimens were also analyzed and failure modes were investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The voiding issues of underfill materials at high temperatures were also evaluated using C-mode scanning acoustic microscopy (C-SAM). The composition of underfills after thermal curing was also investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) techniques. This study of the characteristics of underfill materials is essential in the application of flip-chip packaging. The results show that the selected underfill materials have potential for flip-chip packaging applications due to their comprehensive properties.},

  abstract={A novel four dimensional, patient specific simulation model of solid tumor response to chemotherapeutic treatment in vivo is presented. The special case of glioblastoma multiforme treated by temozolomide is addressed as a simulation paradigm. The model is based on the patient's imaging, histopathologic and genetic data. For a given drug administration schedule lying within acceptable toxicity boundaries, the concentration of the prodrug and its metabolites within the tumor is calculated as a function of time based on the drug pharmacokinetics. A discretization mesh is superimposed upon the anatomical region of interest and within each geometrical cell of the mesh the most prominent biological "laws" are applied. The biological cell fates are predicted based on the drug pharmacodynamics. The outcome of the simulation is a prediction of the spatiotemporal activity of the entire tumor and is virtual reality visualized. A good qualitative agreement of the model's predictions with clinical experience has strengthened the applicability of the approach. Long term clinical and quantitative adaptation and validation as well as modeling the normal tissue reactions are in progress. The proposed model primarily aims at providing a reliable platform for performing patient individualized in silico experiments as a means of chemotherapeutic treatment optimization},

  abstract={Fermentation industries require in-situ real-time monitoring of cell viability during fermentation processes. For this purpose, reagent-free approaches are desired because they can be used for in situ analysis and reduce the system's complexity. We have developed an automatic way of determining cell viability via analysis of time-lapse image sequences taken by dark field microscopy without the aid of any additional reagents. The image processing is based on neural networks based machine vision, involving principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate the dynamic information of intracellular movements. In consequence, the essential features as the vital sign of the target cells are discovered. Viability predictions using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier have been done successfully on the datasets with different qualities. Accuracy up to above 90% has been obtained on the basis of image enhancement. Robustness of the system is proved by the results of the tests. The model organism we have used is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however, this technique can promisingly be applied for the identification of cell viability of other organisms as well},

  abstract={Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the most widely used method for searching large-scale medical image collections; however this approach is not suitable for high-level applications as human experts are accustomed to manage medical images based on their clinical features rather than primitive features. Automatic detection of clinical features in a large-scale image database and realization of image retrieval by clinical content are still open issues. This paper presents a Markov random field (MRF) based model for clinical content detection. Multiple classifiers are applied to recognize a wide range of clinical features in a large-scale histological image database, and they are further combined to generate more reliable and robust estimation. Spatial contexts will cooperate with local estimations in the MRF based model to make a decision based on global consistency. The detected clinical features will provide a basis for image retrieval. Experiments have been carried out in a large-scale histological image database with promising results},

  abstract={The clinostat was originally used to find out why plant roots appear to grow predominantly toward the center of the Earth. Over the last 2-3 decades, slow- and fast-rotating 2D and 3D clinostats have been used to assess cellular adaptation to this environment. A cell culture is placed in a spin module of the clinostat platform and its rotation is set empirically (2-3 rpm). The machine is then allowed to run for a specified period (hours to days) after which the cultures are removed and assayed for specific properties, such as cell growth, size and shape, distribution of receptors, integrity of the cytoskeleton or gene expression. A 3D clinostat was developed by the Microgravity Laboratory/IPCT-PUCRS group and validated by the Stem Cell Group of Kingston University London, which used 4 different types of human cancer cells and cord blood stem cells (CBSC). After rotation for 19h at 37degC, 5%CO2 humidified atmosphere, the 3D clinostat significantly improved proliferation potential of all tested cell populations when compared to static cultures. After only 5 days, high definition microscopic analysis revealed that all CBSC adhered and expanded onto the BDtrade 3D collagen composite scaffolds, and cross-developed into hepatocyte-like cells upon stimulation},

  pages={512-514},
  abstract={Nanostructures of lysozyme molecules and lysozyme-nanogold conjugates were generated by atomic force microscopy in contact-, tapping- and force-distance- mode on mica in aqueous solution. In contact mode at high ionic strength, adjusted lysozyme concentration and lower loading force a monolayer of defined structure and orientation of lysozyme can be formed by the scan process of the tip. A lateral resolution of the monolayer of about 80 nm could be achieved. At larger loading forces besides a lysozyme monolayer also 3D- aggregates could be generated in parallel. In force-distance mode the volume of 3D-aggregates was studied as function of lysozyme concentration, loading force and number or frequency of up- and down-movement of the tip. Also in tapping mode 3D-aggregates were generated at the selected incubation conditions. Application of the linescan mode for solutions of nanogold or lysozyme-nanogold conjugates allowed the formation of monlayers of linear shape with lateral resolution of about 35 nm on mica. Nanogold line-structures could be connected to macroscopic gold contacts. It is postulated that adjustment of electrostatic interaction between lysozyme and substrate and the applied loading force is critical for monolayer formation. Different to the underlying mechanism of the well-established dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) (Piner et al., 1999) for the presented method of diving tip nanowriting (DTN) adsorption of the molecules from the aqueous bulk phase to the tip and thereafter the flow to the mica surface is discussed. DTN could be used to either contact proteins electrically or to form preaggregates for protein crystallization (Wiechmann et al.},

Compared with the histological results, thermo-source characteristics on TTM in 106 cases with breast mass, who would undergo breast surgery, were analyzed according to the parameters such as the depth, morphology, structure, and temperatures of abnormal heat foci in order to find the differences between benign diseases and malignant tumors. The coincidence rates of Thermal Texture Maps with pathological findings and the corresponding thermo-eradiate values in 49 cases with malignancy and 57 cases with benign diseases were 89.5% and 91.9%, 2.599 and 1.822 (P < 0.001), respectively. The statistics differences were significant between the two groups. Contrast sharply with benign diseases, there were irregular morphology, denser structures, higher thermo-eradiate values in malignant tumors. Thermal Texture Maps could be used as an important tool for the differentiation of breast diseases.},

  pages={723-726},
  abstract={Renal tumors are classified into histopathologic subtypes based on light microscopy. Classification is important because subtypes have distinct genetic abnormalities and clinical behavior, yet is difficult because many cases have heterogeneous morphology. Thus, several molecular assays have been developed for tumor classification. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) permits correlation of molecular data with tissue morphology, but is difficult to quantify or perform in multiplex. Quantitative RT-PCR and gene expression microarrays are more quantitative, but lose morphologic information. We hypothesize that direct integration of histopathology with nanomolecular expression profiling will provide sensitive and specific data for renal tumor classification. Thus, we are developing novel IHC assays using antibodies conjugated to nanoparticle tags with surface-enhanced Raman scattering properties (SERS). Our preliminary data suggests that SERS-IHC can be performed using standard microscopic equipment, with potential for sensitive, quantitative multiplex assays on fixed tissues.},

  abstract={The identification of protein-protein interactions along with their spatial and temporal localization is vital data for assigning functional information to proteins. Historically, these data sets obtained from fluorescence microscopy, have been analyzed manually, a process that is both time consuming and tedious. The development of an automated system that can measure the location dynamics of the interaction between two proteins inside a live cell is a high priority. This paper describes an automated image analysis system used to identify the interactions between two proteins of interest fused to either GFP or DIV IVA, a bacterial cell division protein that localizes to the cell poles [1]. Upon the induction of DIV IVA fusion protein expression, the GFP-fusion protein will be recruited to the cell poles if a positive interaction occurs. Advanced image processing and feature extraction algorithms are discussed in detail and a statistical feature set used to quantify the image-based information is developed.},

  volume={},

  pages={1236-1239},
  abstract={The aim of the present work was to assess the merits of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) as vehicles for transdermal iontophoretic drug delivery. For the measurements, either a model drug (triamcinolone acetonide acetate, TAA) or a lipophilic fluorescent probe (nile red, NR) was encapsulated into NLCs. The NLCs with sizes of 100 nm and 350 nm diameter were prepared by high-pressure homogenization technique. The particle size with polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential and morphology were examined by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In vitro penetration studies involved passive penetration and iontophoresis for control (TAA ethanol solution) and TAA-NLCs formulations. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was employed to visualize the distribution of NR-NLCs after skin permeation. The overall results reveal the benefits of the combined use of iontophoresis and NLCs in improving skin penetration parameters. The NLCs with a size of 100 nm seem to be promising for iontophoretic delivery as they have shown maximum enhancement ratio and skin deposition. This is the first report of the use of NLCs as vehicles for transdermal iontophoretic drug delivery},

  pages={1700-1703},
  abstract={The analysis of microscopy images of corneal endothelium is routinely carried out at eye banks to assess cell density, one of the main indicators of cornea health state and quality. We propose here a new method to derive endothelium cell density that, at variance with most of the available techniques, does not require the identification of cell contours. It exploits the feature that endothelium cells are approximately laid out as a regular tessellation of hexagonal shapes. This technique estimates the inverse transpose of a matrix generating this cellular lattice, from which the density is easily obtained. The algorithm has been implemented in a Matlab prototype and tested on a set of 21 corneal endothelium images. The cell densities obtained matched quite well with the ones manually estimated by eye-bank experts: the percent difference between them was on average -0.1% (6.5% for absolute values). Albeit the performances of this new algorithm on the images of our test set are definitely good, a careful evaluation on a much larger data set is needed before any clinical application of the proposed technique could be envisaged. The collection of an adequate number of endothelium images and of their manual densities is currently in progress},

One remedy is to use the topographic structures to approximate the sample surfaces and produce the unknown molecular structures by means of deformable shape generation methods from the topographic models. Here, a training sample set of 3D images is collected for shape discrimination. Morphological watersheds are applied to isolate the cells from the surrounding background. Each detected particle is enclosed within a bounding-box for contrast independent analysis. Topographical structures are adopted to model particle classes and the classification is performed in minimum Euclidian-distance sense.

  abstract={With the increasing importance of molecular and cellular biology, a new type of medicine, molecular based medicine, is now developing. This will significantly alter the way in which medicine is practiced. Central to these developments is the concept of the biological continuum (BC). Medicine today is often practiced at one or two of these levels, i.e. there is generally no vertically integrated approach. In any area of application there will be a wide range of data (both 2-D and 3-D) across the BC. Hence, there is a need to readily access and view the full range of data. In this paper we describe a Web-based interface which allows the user to view images and other data, and to navigate seamlessly from one level of the BC to another level (e.g. from visceral to tissue). We present a geometric framework to link images from these two levels. The interface was developed using SVG and Javascript. An example case study, which focuses on the knee, is presented - MR images of knee at the visceral level and histology images of cartilage at the tissue level. We have shown that with such an interface it is possible to view images from different levels of the BC in a vertically integrated manner},

  abstract={Most microscopic imaging techniques do not have the resolution to visualize individual collagen fibrils in articular cartilage, which possesses unique depth-dependent anisotropy and noticeable topographical heterogeneity. These imaging studies therefore deal with the averaged properties of the tissue. In this report, an ellipse model is introduced to explore the common connections between the anisotropic features of the tissue and the measurable quantities in several imaging techniques, including microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (muMRI), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This model uses three quantities to represent the averaged properties of the tissue: the concentration rho that describes the density of the measurable property, the overall orientation thetas that describes the angular dependent features in the tissue, and the anisotropy epsiv that describes the coherence of the measurable objects. We conclude that this ellipse model may serve as a useful platform to explore the common connections among different imaging results},

  abstract={The process of discriminating among benign and malignant hyperplasia begun with subjective methods using light microscopy and now is continuing with computerized morphometrical analysis that needs some features. One of the main features called volume percentage of stroma (VPS) is gained by calculating the percentage of stroma texture. Currently, this feature is calculated by pathologists on a manual basis. The algorithm here can automatically calculate VPS with a good precision. In this paper we proposed a method for segmentation of this texture based on Gabor wavelets and mathematical morphology. Gabor wavelets attain maximum joint space-frequency resolution which is highly significant in the process of texture segmentation. The ability of Gabor filters in discrimination of texture bands at different scales and orientations has been used to segment stroma texture which is mainly located in middle frequency bands from glandular elements. The proposed procedure could be the first and essential step of diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia in pathology},

  abstract={The electrical properties of breakdown spots in ultrathin gate dielectrics are studied using a newly developed percolation path resistance measurement method [1]. Post-breakdown characterization of the nanometer size breakdown path shows that the breakdown path degrades rapidly during the initial stage of progressive breakdown, and exhibit Schottky-like characteristics in poly-Si/SiNxOy, poly-Si/HfO2and TiN/TaN/HfO2gate stacks. Physical and chemical analysis using transmission electron microscopy provides useful information about the nature of the breakdown induced defects. In order to better characterize the breakdown path within the gate dielectrics matrix, we propose to use ultrahigh energy resolution monochromator-based transmission electron microscopy. This technique allows us to study the chemistry and electronic structures of the percolation path itself, and the percolation path/Si substrate interface and the percolation path/gate electrode interface. The ultimate goal is to understand the materials and electrical properties, and chemistry of breakdown paths in advanced gate stack structures at atomic resolution.},

  abstract={The field emission (FE) properties of lanthanum monosulfide (LaS) films, deposited on Si and InP substrates by pulsed laser deposition, have been thoroughly analyzed via the scanning anode field emission microscopy technique (SAFEM, Fig. 1) at different surface locations and at different temperatures. For one location, the full set of measured I-V characteristics (total measured current versus applied voltage) for different values of Z, the distance between the cathode surface and the probe ball, were then analyzed in order to extract the current density J versus actual applied field F (J-F data), within the approximation that the LaS surface is a plane. A characteristic J-F variation is shown in Fig. 2. The work function of the LaS thin film has been extracted from the slope of the plot ln(J/F/sup 2/) vs 1/F, by using the conventional Fowler-Nordheim relation, leading to a value of /spl sim/0.65 eV which is in agreement with the onset of the electric field needed to observe an emission current density of 1 mA/cm/sup 2/ at an applied electric field across the vacuum gap around 230 V//spl mu/m.},

  abstract={The experiments and theoretical basis for reducing the work function of Au and SiO/sub 2/ thin films are discussed. In order to achieve the quantum interference of free electrons, the geometry of the solid is modified so that the de Broglie waves interfere destructively inside the solid. If a metal surface is modified with patterned indents, the Fermi energy increases and consequently the electron work function decreases. This effect is named the Avto effect. Work function reductions of 0.5 eV and 0.2 eV are observed in Au and SiO/sub 2/ films, respectively. Comparative measurements of work function are made using the Kelvin probe method based on the compensation of internal contact potential difference. Electron emission from the same thin films are also studied using photoelectron emission microscopy.},

  pages={190-191},
  abstract={The electrical and emission properties of as deposited and annealed SiO/sub x/ films have been investigated in details. The films with thickness 20-100 nm are obtained by thermal evaporation of silicon powder in vacuum (2-3)/spl times/10/sup -5/ Torr and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) methods at room temperature on Si substrate. Using atomic force microscopy, it is shown that as deposited SiO/sub x/ (x=3) film is a nano-composite one in which the Si cluster is coated with SiO phase. At low electric fields, the I-V characteristics of dark current of the initial SiO/sub x/ films correspond to Fenkel-Poole transport mechanism. The Fowler-Nordheim tunneling dominates at higher electric fields. As to annealed SiO/sub 2/(Si) films, the modified Fowler-Nordheim electron tunneling through trapezoidal SiO/sub 2/ barrier between silicon nanoclusters restricts the current flow. The analysis of current-voltage characteristics and composition of the SiO/sub 2/(Si) film allowed to estimate the Si clusters size. The obtained results are in good agreement with AFM data. The effective electron field emission from flat silicon wafer coated with nanocomposite SiO/sub x/ film is also observed. Results of the electron field emission measurement show that initial sample emission current (10/sup -7/-10/sup -6/ A) is observed at high voltages (570-770 V). Field emission from thermally treated samples is not observed in the whole range of the applied voltages.},

  abstract={The low electron affinity and excellent transport properties of some conducting organic polymers suggest that they might also provide good unheated cathode materials. It is demonstrated here that this is true also for some non-conjugated, undoped polymers deposited on flat metallic electrodes. The idea to use non-conjugated polymers as field-emission materials came from experimental results where they exhibit high conductivity properties in Metal-Polymer-Metal structures and supercurrents in Superconductor-Polymer-Superconductor structures. The following were used in this experiment: i) imid-siloxane copolymer; ii) aryl-polycarbonate; iii) nylon-60. Polymer films were prepared by deposition of a droplet of 5 % wt. solution on the polished Mo or Nb electrodes with 5 mm in diameter. The films were then heated in air for 1 h at a constant temperature of 370-400 K to remove the major part of the polymer solvent. The field emission was studied in a vacuum of 10 Torr. A stable field emission from polymer-coated cathodes at 4 kV/mm was obtained. However for initial activation of the cathode the threshold field should be 2.5-3 times more than 4 kV/mm. The field emission from polished metals was not observed up to 25 kV/mm. The current-voltage characteristics (CVC) of the cathodes were measured in both forward and reverse directions by high-voltage scanning at a frequency of 50 Hz. At relatively low bias voltages CVC agrees with the Fowler-Nordheim theory. The surface topography and the current distribution of the polymer film was simultaneously investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) before and after the action of electric field at room temperature. The CVC at different points of polymer surface was also investigated. Initially, polymers had smooth surfaces without conductivity but after a threshold field emission the surfaces were strongly modified: conductive arrays were formed up to 400 nm high. The current topography of the polymer film surfaces was visualized the appearance of thin conductive channels distributed evenly enough on the polymer surface. This nanoscale modification of polymer surface in a strong electric field can be explained by local electrification due to self-injection of charge carriers from the metal electrode into a relatively elastic polymer matrix. Low temperature conductivity investigations on Metal(Superconductor)/Polymer film (with arrays)/Metal (Superconductor) structures have been done to understand the nature of conductive arrays.},

  abstract={The present work is devoted to the investigation of the characteristics of field emission from carbon nanoclusters (nanotubes, nanodiamonds and their composites) produced by cold destruction from natural graphite. Field emission microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the structure of the emitting surface. It was shown from the field emission image that this structure has high density of emission centers of approximately equal efficiency. Also, the field emission current varies with electric field, observed from current-voltage characteristics, in accordance with the Fowler-Nordheim law. Investigations of the emission properties of carbon nanoclusters confirmed that field emission from these materials takes place in electric fields more than two orders of magnitude lower than in metals and semiconductors. The current-voltage characteristics investigated in a wide range of currents (4 orders of magnitude) give a positive evidence that the mechanism of electron emission from these materials is linked to tunneling emission. No clear interpretation exists at the moment of the extremely low threshold field for the electron emission from carbon nanoclusters.},

  abstract={The graphite is a well known material for explosive emission cathodes due to the high stability and practically unlimited resource of emission ability. Such merits are resulted from the fact that during the explosive electron emission (EEE) a microrelief with nanometer microtips develops and it mainly conserves on the graphite after the process. However, the sustaining of liquid phase on graphite is possible only due to the high pressure of cathode plasma, since under natural conditions it sublimates by-passing the liquid phase. We have shown previously that nano-scale size tips of 10/sup 8/ sm/sup -2/ surface density are formed at a liquid carbon surface at EEE. The purpose of this work was a more detailed study of the structure and composition of carbon nanoclusters on the surface of graphized polyacrylnitrile fibres by means of scanning electron and field emission microscopy. Emission characteristics of the carbon nanoclusters are studied in the EEE and field electron emission regimes. The field emission initiation threshold is found.},

  abstract={Ion beam induced charge (IBIC) microscopy is used mainly for analysis of various semiconductor parameters such as diffusion length and lifetime of the charge carriers. In this paper, we show that IBIC microscopy is also useful for the visualization of the electrical field distribution within depletion regions of electronic devices. The ions penetrating into the semiconductor generate electron-hole pairs that are separated and accelerated depending on the internal electric field distribution. The shape of the resulting current induced in this way is dependent on the electric field. This dependence and the large penetration depth of the light ions allow the analysis of electric field distributions within semiconductor devices up to a few tens of microns below the device surface. Therefore, IBIC microscopy is a very useful analytical tool for the characterization of the electrical field distribution within high-power devices, even when the semiconductor is covered with thick passivation or metallization layers.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a robust focus algorithm tailored to the requirements of automated microscopy of fluorescently labelled bacteria. We combine two strategies to make the algorithm robust against focus errors due to low bacteria densities and the presence of dirt. First, we acquire a number of focus estimates for different fields on each slide well using a correlation-based focus measure. A planar model is fitted to these initial estimates using robust regression. The fit parameters provide information about slide tilt and the variability of the focus positions. We use this to constrain the search range to the locally optimal range for each field. Second, we introduce a heuristic pre-filtering step, based on a morphological area opening, into the computation of the focus measure to suppress false maxima arising from the presence of dirt particles. The effectiveness of both steps is demonstrated by focus results obtained for a sample slide.},

Nano-sized carbon materials are produced in different structures depending on the precursor and the processing condition used for a direct conversion of methane by thermal plasma process. For this synthesis process, a mixture of argon and hydrogen is used as a plasma forming gas for the thermal plasma jet generated by a DC non-transferred plasma torch. By introducing only pure methane into the mixture plasma flame, nano-sized carbon blacks of spherical and sheet-like shapes are produced simultaneously. On the other hand, by injecting a catalytic metal additive mixed with methane into the plasma, a number of carbon nanotubes with a long hollow structure are synthesized in the optimal operating conditions of the torch. Morphologies and crystallization degrees of the carbon blacks and the nanotubes produced under various processing conditions are evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. In addition to the synthesis process, a numerical analysis on the methane decomposition by the thermal plasma is carried out to understand the distinct formation mechanisms of the nano-sized carbon materials with different structures.},

In addition to the diamond film evaluation, an optical emission spectroscopy (OES) of the thermal plasma jets during the CVD process is performed to examine the chemical and ionizational states of the plasma. Such an OES makes it possible to determine Boltzmann temperature from the selected argon electronic transitions, electron number density from Hbeta emission, vibrational and rotational temperatures from C2 emission (d3Pigrarra3Piu). From the morphology analysis and diagnostic results obtained, the effect of plasma conditions on the diamond film growth will be discussed.},

  pages={355-355},
  abstract={Summary form only given. Results are presented from 3D MHD simulations of X-pinch experiments at Cornell University and the Pontificia Universidad Catolica in Santiago. The simulations reveal how the formation of the key features of X-pinch structure - the central microscopic Z-pinch and the supersonic axial jets - are the direct results of the non-linear evolution of the ablating wire plasmas and the distribution of the Lorentz force. The generation of synthetic diagnostic images from the simulation data allows direct comparison to absorption radiographs from the Cornell experiments and laser interferometry and gated soft X-ray images from Santiago. This comparison showed good agreement with the time dependent structure in both cases. The results of the 3D code were used to initialize 2D cylindrical simulations of the micro Z-pinch region including a recently developed radiation transport package, which could be run at much finer spatial resolution <1 mum. These simulations showed that the experimental results from Cornell and Santiago for the X-ray hot-spot region in X-pinches could be explained in terms of the non-linear development of a m=0 instability in the presence of strong radiative cooling. Both the 3D and the 2D results revealed that the main process determining the radial collapse of the hot-spot region is the reduction in the mass per unit length of the plasma caused by axial outflow. Results are also presented from a simple analytic model of the collapsed state, in which the plasma is assumed to be in radial pressure balance and the energy gained from ohmic heating balances a black-body like radiation loss. Under these conditions, equilibrium values for the radius, density, temperature, X-ray power, etc. can be derived in terms of the current and the mass per unit length. This model was found to be consistent with both the 2D and 3D simulation results and with data for density and temperature versus time during the intense X-ray burst phase, determined spectroscopically in experiments at Cornell and at the Lebedev Institute. This model then allows a scaling to be obtained for peak densities and temperatures as functions of the driver current and the X-pinch material.},

For example, polypropylene surfaces consist of random assemblies of crystalline strands with diameters of 100s nm. Porous materials and textiles also have highly non-planar surfaces. The penetration of plasma generated species (electrons, ions and radicals) into surface structures is of great interest when uniform functionalization of the surface is desired. In this paper, we discuss results from a computational multiscale investigation of atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of surfaces having microstructure. The investigation was conducted with a 2-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model using an unstructured mesh capable of resolving a dynamic range of 1000 in spatial scale. This capability enables a multi-scale approach in which the reactor scale plasma hydrodynamics and penetration of plasma produced species into surface structures can be simultaneously addressed. A surface kinetics model is integrated with the plasma hydrodynamics model to assess the uniformity of treatment on the surface structures. Investigations were preformed for discharges in atmospheric pressure air and He/O2 mixtures, the latter being for treating surfaces when nitrogen fixing is not desired. A typical treatment geometry consists of a dielectric barrier-corona with a gap of a few mm to the surface to be treated. Surface structures have characteristic dimensions of a few mum. We found that the uniformity of treatment of polymers such as polypropylene is sensitive to the gas mixture and polarity of the discharge pulses on both macroscopic (a few mm) and microscopic (<1 mum) scales. For example, the fraction of O2, which in turn determines the rate of formation of O3, can be used to optimize uniformity by controlling the rate of transport and reaction limited processes},

  year={2005},

  pages={291-291},
  abstract={Summary form only given. A field enhancement factor is often required at the macroscopic scale in order to explain field emission current densities due to geometric features. The local field enhancement factor beta is often introduced in the Fowler-Nordheim equation to represent the geometrical effects at the surface of cathode. Local variation of beta determines the local dependence of injection current by the Fowler-Nordheim law. In computational models, it is impractical to determine the time-dependent local surface field each time step on a microscopic space scale. Effective beta is introduced in this paper which allows us to study the emission properties at a macroscopic scale. Microscopic (subgrid) local effective beta is calculated only at the initial time step, and then the effective beta can be recomputed under different surface electrical field through this model. The model allows reduction of dimensionality as well as the ability to include subgrid effects. The model is demonstrated on fundamental cases and compared to a calculation with a mesh fine enough to resolve the geometric features},

  abstract={To map out device sensitivity with submicrometric resolutions it is traditional to use a microbeam. In recent years ion electron emission microscopy (IEEM) is emerging as an innovative method for device characterization. An advanced implementation of this instrument is under development at the SIRAD irradiation facility at the Legnaro national laboratory (LNL). The aim of this work is the final test and the characterization of the SIRAD IEEM in a realistic environment by using synchronus dynamic RAM (SDRAM) commercial off the shelf (COTS) devices to confirm the capability of the SIRAD IEEM to map out the single event effect (SEE) sensitivity of a typical microelectronic device and to measure its resolution. A potential problem during IEEM operations is the large number of ions that have to be collected on the device under test (DUT) that will induce a degradation of the device characteristics similar to that generated by total ionizing dose (TID). This paper investigates this issue and proposes an online method to monitor the degradation of the devices under test based on the measurement of the bit retention time (BRT), that is the time the information is retained in a memory cell without refresh in SDRAM devices. This paper presents the experimental setup and the results of TID and SEE tests performed to validate the method. The results of TID tests with 60Co gamma ray, initially performed to investigate the method, show that BRT measurements could be used to online monitor the level of TID the device accumulates. The same tests performed during heavy ion irradiation show that ions produce similar effects on the SDRAM so that BRT could be used during IEEM operation to monitor the degradation of the DUT. TID and single event upset (SEU) effects have been investigated on Micron 256 Mb MT48LC64M4A2Y96A SDRAM devices at the 60Co gamma facility of the Istituto per la Sintesi Organica e la Fotoreattivita and at the SIRAD irradiation facility at the XTU Tandem of the INFN - CNR Legnaro National Laboratories (LNL).},

  abstract={Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are found in area applications such as the automotive industry, the aviation industry, the semiconductor industry, the medical field, and various other fields where miniaturization is taking over. The accurate measurement of features on the surface of MEMS is an important tool for the assessment and monitoring of product quality. Presented here are the algorithms and results of 3D model reconstructions of MEMS devices using a variety of microscopic sensors. These sensors include an atomic force microscope, a scanning electron microscope, and a laser scanning confocal microscope. MEMS devices with micron-size features were first scanned with these microscopes. 3D models were then built and visualized using methods specific to each microscope. This allows for the models use in applications such as inspection, study of wear and tear, behavior, and reaction of such systems to pressure, heat, and friction.},

  year={2005},
  volume={49},
  number={1},
  pages={49-63},
  abstract={During the initial stages of copper electrodeposition onto a thin seed layer, a nonuniform potential distribution arises, resulting in local variations in growth rate and deposit morphology. Early stages of morphology evolution during copper electrodeposition are of practical importance but have not been well studied. Here, a new multiscale approach is developed for numerical simulation of the effect of a macroscopic potential distribution along a seed layer on microscopic local roughness evolution. The key contribution is a generic method for coupling multiple computer codes, and the demonstration of its use. The macroscopic code passes the local potential at ten points along the seed layer to ten kinetic Monte Carlo codes, each of which simulates additive-free copper electrodeposition and roughness evolution on an initially flat surface. Periodically, each Monte Carlo code computes the local film thickness and passes it back to the resistance code, which updates the potential distribution for the next iteration. Results are obtained for a wide range of parameter space including both constant-potential and constant-current operation. A confirmation procedure was developed to verify that the multiscale approach (using small Monte Carlo simulation domains with periodic boundary conditions) does not significantly alter the physical accuracy of the simulations.},

  pages={479-484},
  abstract={Two main types of cervical mucus have been described during the menstrual cycle: oestrogenic and progestative. Each category shows diverse morphological and functional features from the reproductive point of view. Traditionally, this change has been approached by analysing morphological patterns. In fact, a mesh model has been described for cervical mucus, structurally composed of fibrillar subunits with a parallel orientation, together with another model in a characteristic network shape with canalicular units, but the real model is not clear. The objective of our work was to study the different morphological structures of the mucus, as related to the day of follicular rupture (considered as day 0) determined by ultrasound. Cervical mucus samples were obtained from the cervical canal with an ASPIRETTE™ from day −4 to day +1 of the menstrual cycle. Samples were fixed and dried by critical point. The ultrastructure was examined with scanning electron microscopy. The presence of three types of oestrogenic and one type of progestative cervical mucus was confirmed in this period. Our paper shows different types of ultrastructure in the oestrogenic mucus in relation to ovulation, which would help to understand the interaction between male gametes and cervical mucus in migration through the female genital tract.},

  abstract={Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been used to study compositional modulation in InxGa1−x N layers grown with compositions close to miscibility gap. The samples (0.34 < x < 0.8) were deposited by molecular beam epitaxy using either a 200 nm thick AlN or GaN buffer layer grown on a sapphire substrate. Periodic compositional modulation leads to extra electron diffraction spots and satellite reflections in XRD in the θ–2θ coupled geometry. The ordering period Δ measured along c-axis was about Δ = 45 Å for x = 0.5 and Δ = 66 Å for x = 0.78 for samples grown on AlN buffer layer. TEM and XRD determinations of Δ were in good agreement. Compositional modulation was not observed for the sample with x = 0.34 grown on a GaN buffer layer. Larger values of Δ were observed for layers with higher In content and for those having larger mismatch with the underlying AlN buffer layer. The possibility that the roughness of the AlN growth surface promotes strong In segregation on particular crystallographic planes leading to compositional modulation is considered.},

High-resolution STEM imaging, when combined with nanodiffraction, atomic resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy and nanometer resolution X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy techniques, is critical to the fundamental studies of importance to nanoscience and nanotechnology. The availability of sub-nanometer or sub-angstrom electron probes in a STEM instrument, due to the use of a field emission gun and aberration correctors, ensures the greatest capabilities for studies of sizes, shapes, defects, crystal and surface structures, and compositions and electronic states of nanometer-size regions of thin films, nanoparticles and nanoparticle systems. The various imaging, diffraction and spectroscopy modes available in a dedicated STEM or a field emission TEM/STEM instrument are reviewed and the application of these techniques to the study of nanoparticles and nanostructured catalysts is used as an example to illustrate the critical role of the various STEM techniques in nanotechnology and nanoscience research.},

  abstract={Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a widely used tool for analysis of very large scale integrated (VLSI) semiconductor devices. As a special TEM-feature, off-axis electron holography obtains information about the electrical characteristics of a specimen, which are connected to the dopant concentration in the bulk material. Compared with conventional TEM, application of electron holography for dopant profiling demands a higher quality of specimen preparation, e.g. in terms of thickness homogeneity. Since preparation by means of focused ion beam (FIB) has become an industrial standard for TEM-investigations, its facilities are investigated for meeting the high holographic demands. It turned out that, besides many advantages like precision and speed, the use of FIB for preparation introduces new specific problems, e.g. it is hardly possible to visualize doped areas of semiconductors on a classical, thin FIB specimen. Additionally, some artifacts of FIB-preparation have no great importance for normal TEM analysis, but do significantly influence the results of holographic analysis. In order to satisfy the higher demands of preparation for holography, a special procedure for FIB-preparation has been newly developed.},

  abstract={Here we show a technique to obtain a tilt series of dark-field (DF) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in ordering alloys for tomographic three-dimensional (3D) observations. A tilt series of DF TEM images of D1a-ordered Ni4Mo precipitates in a Ni–Mo alloy was successfully obtained by adjusting a diffraction condition for a superlattice reflection from the Ni4Mo precipitates. Since the superlattice reflection usually has a long extinction distance, dynamic diffraction effects such as thickness fringes can be suppressed to some extent with precise realignment of the diffraction condition. By using the tilt series of the DF TEM images, we attempted a computed TEM tomography to visualize 3D shapes and positions of the precipitates.},

The amount of Cl atoms found on the surface is approximately twice as large as that of the CH3 molecules.

  abstract={The morphological effects of micafungin, a member of a new class of antifungal agents candins, on growing hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus were studied by the use of Nomarski microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thin-section electron microscopy. Micafungin at concentrations of 0.001–0.1 μg ml−1 strongly inhibited the in vitro growth of this fungus and induced striking changes in the hyphal morphology, depending on the drug concentration and the length of the incubation period. The changes observed included increased formation of branches on the lateral walls, disruption of the tips of both hyphal cells and branches, and crushing and collapse of whole hyphae. In addition, micafungin was also effective in damaging membranous structures, including disruption of the cell membrane, partial loss of nuclear membranes and expansion of endoplasmic reticula. From these results, it was concluded that micafungin primarily affected the normal formation of cell walls and septa of growing hyphae. The inhibition of apical growth of hyphae accompanied by excessive lateral branching that was followed by disruption of both hyphal tips and branch tips ultimately led to the destruction of whole hyphae. This cytological effect of micafungin on the hyphal growth of A. fumigatus can explain its potent anti-Aspergillus activity.},

  abstract={The thermal transformations of pyrophyllite to mullite by heating were re-examined using mainly energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy and, for the first time, the texture electron diffraction pattern of the mullite was completely interpreted. Through a temperature range in which pyrophyllite dehydroxylate maintained a long-range order with a fluctuation of ∼1% in d-spacings of (100) and (010) planes at 1000°C, without prominent exothermic feature, pyrophyllite dehydroxylate was gradually decomposed and transformed into mullite through topotaxy. Pyrophyllite dehydroxylate did not collapse completely until 1100°C, which promoted the rapid growth of mullite in random orientation at 1200°C and the crystallization of amorphous silica to cristobalite at 1300°C. The mullite needles, having their c-axis (texture axis) parallel to the elongation direction, lined up along the b*-axis of the pyrophyllite dehydroxylate in the needle-texture electron diffraction patterns. The mullite needles had monoclinic symmetry with lattice parameters of 7.27 Å (a), 7.75 Å (b), 2.90 Å (c), 90° (α), 90° (β) and 88.41° (γ), which, because of the structural affiliation to the parent pyrophyllite dehydroxylate, differ to the orthorhombic 3/2-mullite.},

  abstract={This paper presents a shape-based approach in extracting thin structures, such as lines and sheets, from three-dimensional (3D) biomedical images. Of particular interest is the capability to recover cellular structures, such as microtubule spindle fibers and plasma membranes, from laser scanning confocal microscopic (LSCM) data. Hessian-based shape methods are reviewed. A synthesized linear structure is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the multiscale filtering approach in extracting closely positioned fibers. We find that the multiscale approach tends to fuse lines together, which makes it unsuitable for visualizing mouse egg spindle fibers. Single-scale Gaussian filters, balanced between sensitivity and noise resistance, are adopted instead. In addition, through an ellipsoidal Gaussian model, the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are quantitatively associated with the standard deviations of the Gaussian model. Existing shape filters are simplified and applied to LSCM data. A significant improvement in extracting closely positioned thin lines is demonstrated by the resultant images. Further, the direct association of shape models and eigenvalues makes the processed images more understandable qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract={In microscopy, regions of interest are usually much smaller than the whole slide area. Various microscopy related medical applications, such as telepathology and computer aided diagnosis, are liable to benefit greatly from microscope auto positioning on previously defined regions of interest. In this paper, we present a method for image-based auto positioning on a microscope slide. The method is based on localization of a microscopic query image using a previously acquired slide map.

  abstract={White blood cell detection is one of the most basic and key steps in the automatic recognition system of white blood cells in microscopic blood images. Its accuracy and stability greatly affect the operating speed and recognition accuracy of the whole system. But there are only a few methods available for cell detection or segmentation due to the complexity of the microscopic images. This paper focuses on this issue. Based on the detailed analysis of the existing two methods-threshold segmentation followed by mathematical morphology (TSMM), and the fuzzy logic method-a new detection algorithm (NDA) based on fuzzy cellular neural networks is proposed. NDA combines the advantages of TSMM and the fuzzy logic method, and overcomes their drawbacks. With NDA, we can detect almost all white blood cells, and the contour of each detected cell is nearly complete. Its adaptability is strong and the running speed is expected to be comparatively high due to the easy hardware implementation of FCN. Experimental results show good performance},

  pages={166-170},
  abstract={To characterize the magnetodynamic properties of a perpendicular recording system, consisting of a pole head, a recording layer, an exchangebreak layer, and a soft underlayer (SUL), we have built a test vehicle by depositing either the SUL, or the full medium stack on the air-bearing surface of the recording head. Using ultra-high-speed scanning Kerr microscopy, the intrinsic switching characteristics of the SUL and the impact of the recording layer on the former has been measured. One important feature found is the formation of vortices during reversal which are much larger than the pole area as well as evidence for spin wave excitation in the SUL. Both fast write current steps, and complex write current waveforms have been applied and significant differences of the magnetic responses are observed. Though the Kerr signal probes the temporal evolution of the SUL surface magnetization, it is possible to determine the onset of the recording layer switching by taking its magnetostatic coupling to the SUL into account. The magnetization state of the recording layer also impacts the switching speed of the SUL. The noise characteristics of the Kerr signal gives information about nonreproducible magnetization processes in the SUL.},

  abstract={The emission and conductivity characteristics of oxide cathodes depend largely on the activation process. In this paper, the electrical properties of new type of oxide cathodes for cathode ray tube (CRT) application, supplied by LG Philips Displays, have been investigated in relation to different cathode activation regimes. The influence of the activation process over different durations has been investigated. A temperature of T=1425 K was chosen to be higher than the optimum cathode activation temperature (T=1200 K), and the other temperature of T=1125 K was lower than that. The electron activation energy (E) was found to vary in the range from 0.58 to 2.28 eV for cathodes activated at the higher temperature regime, and from 1.08 to 1.9 eV for those activated at the lower temperature regime. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron diffraction X-ray (EDX) analyses show a structural phase transformation in the oxide material that was activated at 1125 K for a period of 1-12 hours. The SEM mapping shows a large contamination of Ba in the top layer of oxide material. The activator agents tungsten and aluminum are found to penetrate into the BaO/spl bsol/SrO layer in two different ways.},

  abstract={Market demands and legislation are driving the electronics-manufacturing sector to move rapidly toward a lead-free future, with Pb-containing electronics products to be banned in Europe after 2006. Although the related scientific research has been undertaken for a decade, a number of technical complications still exist, which are further exacerbated due to the concurrent developments in miniaturization and multifunctionality of microelectronic products. As the packaging joint geometry shrinks toward a microscopic scale, the joint fabrication and reliability become extremely sensitive to the composition and resulting microstructure generated from the chosen joining process and materials. The current level of understanding of such issues is still in its infancy and therefore requires further fundamental study. Thermodynamic modeling is employed in this work as a computational tool to study the sensitivity of processing ranges (e.g., reflow temperature) and the resultant reliability of the microjoints by changing the alloying elements and their content in Sn-based lead-free systems. The work is implemented using the MTDATA program developed by the National Physical Laboratory. With a newly developed database containing critically assessed thermodynamic data appropriate for lead-free solder systems, MTDATA allows the prediction of the liquid-solid transformation and phase formation, for example, as a function of chemical composition and temperature. The paper emphasizes the formation and mass fraction of intermetallic precipitates of different phases in the bulk solder joints and the modeling is also validated through experimental work and recent literature. The results are expected to assist the optimization of processing parameters and cost-effective production using lead-free solders.},

  abstract={In this paper we present a ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) modeling for the Si/Ge quantum dots characterization. BEEM is a new characterization technique by using electrons ejected from the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip to investigate the metal-semiconductor interfaces. Because of the high resolution of the STM system, BEEM is promising in the characterization of quantum dots as the charge transport on individual dot can be characterized compared to the multitude of dots necessitated in other techniques. This method requires three terminals: a connection to the STM tip to inject electrons, a connection to the sample to collect electrons that traverse the interface, and a third grounding terminal. The energy and angular distribution of the injected electrons can be controlled by varying the tip potential. By using the characteristic data of the injected and collected electrons, many useful transport-related properties of the sample can be obtained. The silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) may be fabricated by taking advantage of the Stranski-Krastanov growth model.

Generally, fast ions are used for modification of surfaces via ion beam writing. Their kinetic energy is not only dissipated close to the surface but also in deeper layers of the material. Associated radiation damage could become a problem in the production of novel 3D micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS). Slow (< 1keV) multiply-charged ions as opposed to fast ions are a new tool for gentler structuring of surfaces at the nanometer-scale. The substrate is modified only at and slightly below the surface, opening the possibility of controlling electronic properties at the nanometer scale, vertically and horizontally. Materials under investigation are highly orientated pyrolytic graphite, single crystal insulators (quartz, mica, aluminum oxide), hydrogen-terminated single-crystal silicon, AsSe- and Se-glass and mylar foils. The materials modified by the ion irradiation are investigated with scanning probe microscopy (AFM, STM) in ultrahigh vacuum and in ambient conditions.},

  abstract={The motivation for research into n-type strained-Si/SiGe-on-insulator metal-oxide field effect transistors (SiGe-OI MOSFETs) is to take advantage of both the enhancement of electron transport properties due to strain and the mass production of advanced CMOS technology. Two dimensional self-consistent ensemble Monte Carlo simulation has been used to provide a description of the steady and transient charge transport in a strained-Si/SiGe-OI nMOSFET with 55 nm gate length. The simulated device is similar to that investigate experimentally by the IBM group. The simulation provides information on the microscopic details of the carrier behavior, including carrier velocity, kinetic energy, and carrier density, as a function of position in the device. Detailed time-dependent voltage signal analysis has been carried out to test the device response and derive the frequency bandwidth, which has been compared with the result of an identical analysis performed on a conventional planar geometry silicon-on-insulator (SOI) n-MOSFET of similar dimensions and doping. A sinc voltage pulse is applied to the gate and the resulting drain current and gate currents used to calculate the current gain as a function of frequency. Figure 5 shows that the current gain of Si/SGOI MOSFET could have an intrinsic cut-off frequency approaching 200 ± 10 GHz, a 50 % improvement over the unstrained device.},

  year={2006},

  number={1},
  pages={75-80},
  abstract={This paper investigated the degradation and breakdown characteristics of an ultrathin silicon dioxide film by using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) with repetitive ramped voltage stress (RVS). Two-step oxide degradation was determined from the measured current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and topographies. In the first step, bond breaking and negative-charge accumulation near the SiO/sub 2//Si interface causes oxide thinning and an effective increase in SiO/sub 2//Si barrier height. In this step, hard breakdown (HBD) actually does not occur until permanent damage is produced within the oxide during the second step after several times of repetitive RVS. The permanent damage produced inside the oxide film is in the form of traps, which will cause the crooked I-V curves and a larger I-V shift along the voltage axis. A two-trap-assisted tunneling (TTAT) model was proposed to explain the postbreakdown I-V behaviors. In this model, two isolated traps were generated in the oxide after breakdown. The trap location of the nearer traps determines the bending of the postbreakdown I-V curves and that of the farther traps causes the I-V oxide voltage shift along the voltage axis. The model fits the measured postbreakdown I-V curves well when the locations of both the nearer trap and the farther trap are chosen correctly.},

The technique is based on the use of anisotropic wet etching of [110] silicon wafers to yield silicon features with vertical sidewalls. The paper demonstrates that this method successfully produces copper lines which serve as ECD control structures and the process can be applied to any damascene compatible material for developing electrical linewidth measurement reference material.},

We propose a new multivariate, automated and scalable method for building drug profiles by using a decision hyperplane. The method was evaluated by using 23 compounds belonging to four groups of known mechanisms. We produced quantitative profiles that group drugs with similar mechanisms together, and separate drugs with dissimilar mechanisms from each other.

  abstract={Robustly segmenting vessels even with less sharp boundary is important for achieving accurate biological analysis of blood vessels regulation within organs such as liver. This process is crucial for microvaculature reconstruction which is necessary for red blood cells flow distribution regulation analysis. The vessels with sharp edges are often used during manual analysis skewing the data toward a certain group of vessels. In this paper, we propose bridging vessel snake (BVS) for segmenting a network of vessels (especially ones with less sharp boundary) in intravital microscopy images. Our method enables segmentation of vessels with varying diameter while imposing the structure of vessels by utilizing a ribbon snake and adding energies of width and region. The initialization achieved by the skeletonization is used to segment mostly sharper vessels. The "bridges" between the segmentation of sharper (thus higher confidence) vessels are used for hypothesizing less sharp vessels. A preliminary evaluation against a manual ground truth using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve reveals that the algorithm was able to improve the area under ROC curve up to 20% on the vessels with lower sharpness and achieve the area under a ROC in all ground truthed vessels of 0.90.},

We will present a fast and robust approach that estimates the vessel diameter with a low coefficient of error < 6% in settings that are typical for such in-vivo imaging scenarios with a low signal-to-noise ratio and often sub-optimal and uneven background illumination.

With the addition of the simplest multiresolution features, the same group obtained the highest reported accuracy of 91.5% for the denoised 2D HeLa data set. Here, we aim to improve upon that system by adding the true power of multiresolution adaptivity. In the process, we build a system able to work with any feature sets and any classifiers, which we denote as a generic classification system (GCS). Our system consists of multiresolution (MR) decomposition in the front, followed by feature computation and classification in each subband, yielding local decisions. This is followed by the crucial step of combining all those local decisions into a global one, while at the same time ensuring that the resulting system does no worse than a no-decomposition one. On a nondenoised data set and a much smaller number of features (a combination of texture and Zernicke moment features) and a neural network classifier, we obtain a high accuracy of 89.8%, effectively proving that the space-frequency localized information in the subbands adds to the discriminative power of the system},

  abstract={Tagging and tracking protein compounds/compounds are key to a better understanding of proteomics such as protein-protein interaction and protein signaling pathway. In this paper, a generalized region tracking framework by statistical particle filter (PF) is presented for tracing the movement of protein compounds in confocal microscopy images. To effectively select the features to be tracked, a grid-based minimum variance spatial sampling method is developed. A similarity distance function is presented for feature correspondence finding. The experimental results demonstrate the tracking performance of the proposed framework for small size protein objects with irregular motions and large shape deformation in highly cluttered environment},

  year={2006},

  abstract={To study the structure and branch pattern of neurons, it is important to segment and track neurons at first. We develop a snake model based on repulsive force to segment neurons in 3D microscopy image stacks. To overcome the difficulty that the boundary between two adjacent neurons is weak, we introduce a shape constraint on the snake deformation and use repulsive force to keep snakes of adjacent objects from merging into one. After obtaining the contours on the first image slice, we project them to the next slice as initialization for snake deformation and repeat the process for all the slices in a 3D image stacks. Individual neuron is tracked by connecting the corresponding snake through all slices. Results obtained from processing real data show that the method can successfully segment two or more neurons that are close to each other in 3D},

  abstract={Dendritic spines play an important role in synaptic transmission. Spines are small protrusions formed on the shafts of dendrites and they are manifest of many neurological conditions. Three dimensional images of dendrites and spines are obtained by confocal and two-photon laser scanning microscopy. We present an image processing method based on shape analysis to detect spines and separate spines from the dendrites for quantitative study. The method applies two grassfire procedures to first find the tips of spines and then reversely locate the boundary between spines and dendrites. The boundary is determined as the propagation front that undergoes the maximum change in plane area of the grassfire procedure. We use real data to demonstrate the performance of the method},

  abstract={We present an algorithm for the segmentation of multicell fluorescence microscopy images. Such images abound and a segmentation algorithm robust to different experimental conditions as well as cell types is becoming a necessity. In cellular imaging, among the most often used segmentation algorithms is seeded watershed. One of its features is that it tends to oversegment, splitting the cells, as well as create segmented regions much larger than a true cell. This can be an advantage (the entire cell is within the region) as well as a disadvantage (a large amount of background noise is included). We present an algorithm which segments with tight contours by building upon an active contour algorithm - STACS, by Pluempitiwiriyawej et al. We adapt the algorithm to suit the needs of our data and use another technique, topology preservation by Han et al., to build our topology preserving STACS (TPSTACS). Our algorithm significantly outperforms the seeded watershed both visually as well as by standard measures of segmentation quality: recall/precision, area similarity and area overlap.},

  title={Joint texture and topography estimation for extended depth of field in brightfield microscopy}, 
  year={2006},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={778-781},
  abstract={Brightfield microscopy often suffers from limited depth of field, which prevents thick specimens from being imaged entirely in-focus. By optically sectioning the specimen, the in-focus regions can be acquired over multiple images. Extended depth of field methods aim at combining the information from these images into a single in-focus image of the texture on the specimen's surface. The topography provided by these methods is limited to a map of the selected in-focus image for every pixel and is inherently discretized, which limits its use for quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we propose a joint texture and topography estimation, based on an image formation model for a thick specimen incorporating the point spread function. The problem is stated as a least-squares fitting where the texture and the topography are updated alternately. The method also acts as a deconvolution operation when the in-focus image has some blur left, or when the true in-focus position falls in-between two slices. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated with simulated and experimental results},
